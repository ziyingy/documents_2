Abstract = {The nature and manifestations of relevance are discussed. Studies on relevance which were conducted over the past 30 years are examined, and an updated framework on the subject is presented. Its manifestations are classified into several kinds of relevance that establish an independent system of relevances. Major trends that shape relevance work are also provided in conclusions.},
