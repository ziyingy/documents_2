It is no accident that in the </br>military-political confrontation of states and in other kinds of </br>foreign and domestic conflicts we are now seeing a tendency </br>toward a shift in the center of gravity away from traditional </br>methods of force and means of combat toward nontraditional </br>methods, including information. Their impact is imperceptible </br>and appears gradually. It is less burdensome economically and is </br>not dangerous ecologically. But the main thing is that it is </br>difficult to get rid of. More and more often they will turn </br>openly to military force when all other available possibilities </br>for influence are already exhausted or military actions will </br>likely be brief and, as they say, certain of victory. A graphic </br>example of this is the war in 1990-91 in the zone of the Persian </br>Gulf. </br>  Thus, today information and information technologies are </br>becoming a real weapon. A weapon not just in a metaphoric sense </br>but in a direct sense as well. Natural questions are: What is </br>the objective of the information action, under what principle </br>does it work, and what kinds of dangerous effects of information </br>are there? </br>  One of the basic targets of the influence of information is </br>the consciousness and mind of man. Depending on the objectives </br>being pursued, the scope of the actions, the nature and content </br>of the tasks being resolved, and the forces and means being </br>applied, these people may be specific persons (state and </br>political leaders, employees of special services, military </br>personnel, workers in law enforcement agencies, scientists, and </br>members of political parties and movements) or particular social </br>groups (workers, entrepreneurs, young people, housewives, etc.). </br>But under the conditions when the system for the management of </br>the state has been disrupted and a situation of public-political </br>and socioeconomic instability has been created in the country or </br>in a specific region, the entire population may be the target of </br>its influence. </br>  The basis of the information action is a specially selected </br>or developed information put into circulation with the help of </br>well-defined and above all psychological methods and means at </br>the proper time by some state or other or particular political </br>forces against a selected target. Especially great here is the </br>role of negative information or disinformation. Let us remember </br>how the bloody events began in one of the former Central Asian </br>republics of the USSR. A rumor (""They slaughtered our people at </br>the bazaar because of a glass of strawberries"") falling on the </br>still-smoldering embers of interethnic disagreements about </br>purely routine matters provoked mass killings of completely </br>innocent women, children, and old men and led to many thousands </br>of refugees. </br>  The events of recent years abroad and in our country show </br>that a special role in the influence of information on the </br>public consciousness belongs to television, above all, </br>apparently, because it gives the viewers the illusion of </br>participating in what is taking place on the screen. Moreover, </br>we live under conditions in which the receipt of information </br>from other official sources is made more difficult. A very </br>dangerous phenomenon in this respect was the crisis in the </br>newspaper and magazine business, the dramatic decline in the </br>circulation of printed publications, and the worsening of their </br>distribution. </br>  Here, for example, is how television was used in the </br>development of public opinion at the very beginning of the </br>bloody events in Bosnia. On one of the days, the television </br>companies of many countries showed the mortaring of peaceful </br>inhabitants of Sarayevo--Muslims standing in line for bread. And </br>it all happened live, as they say, as though those who filmed </br>the chilling scenes were informed of the coming events in </br>advance. And is it possbile that this is how it was? They </br>blamed the Serbs for the crime. And many television viewers </br>hundreds or thousands of kilometers away from the place of the </br>tragedy, not to mention the Muslims of Bosnia, certainly </br>believed this. Later, however, UN workers were able to determine </br>that in reality the bloody provocation was the work of Muslim </br>militants who had selected their coreligionists as targets. But </br>the deed, as they say, had already been done. </br>  It is possible to present a great many such examples of </br>falsification and manipulation of facts, including in the public </br>mass media. </br>  Television and radio are becoming the predominant means of </br>information in the army as well. And if one takes into account </br>the growing psychological tension in the society, the loss of </br>moral guidelines and values by most of our citizens, and the </br>uncertainty about tomorrow, then television--if its standards </br>are set by commercial interests as is done here--can also become </br>an agent for social degradation. The scenes of violence on the </br>screen, the propaganda of profit by any means, the </br>permissiveness and disdain for the law, the pornography, and the </br>forgetting of the many centuries of Russian history hardly </br>strengthened the moral foundations of the army. </br>  The techniques for the introduction of negative information </br>and disinformation into the consciousness of people are quite </br>varied. They may conditionally be divided into obvious </br>techniques, unconvincing methods, delayed perception, </br>repetition, argued methods, and techniques for resolute </br>conclusions. </br>  Obvious techniques are those that do not require additional </br>information for the understanding of the basic content of the </br>material being disseminated. Assertions are one example. They </br>represent firm statements presented as obvious facts not </br>requiring proof. Here any complex situation may be simplified to </br>the point where, let us say, the cause of all troubles </br>(economic, political, military, etc.) becomes quite obvious. </br>Thus, for example, the culprit in the economic crisis in a </br>number of republics of the former USSR may be declared to be </br>either persons of another nationality, so-called ""migrants,"" or </br>people with a different political orientation. And this, as </br>everyone knows, was one of the reasons for the national-civil </br>wars in Moldova, the Transcaucasus, and Tajikistan.... </br>  Unconvincing methods operate under the principle: ""You can </br>believe it or not, I do not vouch for its authenticity."" </br>Particularly outstanding among these methods are insinuations </br>employed to establish or evoke in the target of the action </br>doubts about particular ideas, social groups, or individual </br>personalities with the purpose of producing a schism in the </br>midst of the target group. This is usually done through </br>allusions, half-truths, and allegories so that the target of the </br>action will draw his own conclusions but in such a way that is </br>necessary for the one disseminating the information. The themes </br>of the insinuations may be political views, socioeconomic, </br>national, and religious differences, the personal lives of </br>undesirable representatives of the state and military </br>leadership, power structures, leaders of political parties, and </br>entrepreneurs, the sources of their income, and the like. </br>  In the use of methods of delayed perception, the target of </br>the action perceives the basic content of the information only </br>after becoming familiar with secondary materials. The </br>premeditated concealment of certain information until it is no </br>longer of current interest may serve as an example here. </br>  Methods of repetition make it possible, figuratively </br>speaking, to ""pound"" information into the subconciousness of the </br>individual, the destructive action of which may subsequently be </br>initiated at the proper time with the help of some slogan, </br>appeal, combination of words, or symbols. </br>  Arguments used in a negative information action are </br>presented </br>as a reason explaining the behavior or thinking of the target of </br>the action. In so doing, it is sufficient to set different </br>accents, remove some ""inconvenient"" details, and make some </br>selective passes and the same argument can have a different </br>sound to it and accordingly and different effect. </br>  In speaking of the negative information effect on the </br>personnel of the army and navy, it is necessary to pay special </br>attention to rumors. Let us see what rumors represent, what are </br>the reasons for their formation, how they influence the </br>attitudes, behavior, and life aims of the individual, and what </br>measures can be taken to counteract them. </br>  People who encounter something that they cannot </br>understand--real or invented but, as they see it, </br>important--always strive to get rid of mental tensi",FBIS3-27407,"Language: <F P=105> Chinese </F></br>Article Type:BFN </br></br><F P=106> [Article by Ma Kai (7456 0418), vice minister of the State </F></br>Commission for Restructuring Economic System: ""Speed up </br>Fostering and Developing the Market System""] </br>  [Text] The section ""Fostering and Developing the Market </br>System"" in the ""Decision by the CPC Central Committee Concerning </br>Certain Issues on Building the Socialist Market Economic System"" </br>clarifies six interrelated issues. To study conscientiously and </br>understand profoundly these important expositions in the </br>""Decision"" is of important guiding significance to promoting the </br>growth of China's market system and speeding up the building of </br>the new socialist market economic system. </br><H3>  The Market System -- The Core of the Socialist Market </br>Economic System </H3></br>  To foster and develop the market system is the essential </br>requirement for building the socialist market economic system. </br>The essence of the new system is to enable the market to play a </br>basic role in allocating resources under state macroeconomic </br>regulation and control. An improved market system is the </br>operational carrier and operational basis for the market to play </br>a basic role in allocating resources. The extent of the growth </br>of the market system shows the extent of the role played by the </br>market in allocating resources, and also marks the maturity of </br>the market economic system. In this sense, the market system </br>and its operational mechanism is the core of the socialist </br>market economic system. </br>  To foster and develop market economy is an important pillar </br>in constructing the basic framework of the new system. The </br>""Decision"" of the Third Plenary Session of the 14th CPC Central </br>Committee depicts the basic framework of the socialist market </br>economic system, including: A modern enterprise system, a </br>developed market system, an improved macroeconomic regulation </br>and control system, a rational personal income and distribution </br>system, and a multilevel social insurance system. These five </br>major pillars, interrelated and interconstrained, together </br>constitute the basic framework of the new system, maintain in </br>common the normal operation of the new system, and realize </br>jointly the basic role of the market in allocating resources </br>under macroeconomic regulation and control. To build up a </br>modern enterprise system, and enable enterprises to truly manage </br>to ""look for the market and not the mayor,"" it is necessary to </br>take building a developed market system as the prerequisite. </br>The macroeconomic regulation and control system is mainly </br>applying economic levers and economic policies to guide </br>enterprises by market regulation and control, and one cannot </br>depart from an improved market system to exercise indirect </br>management of enterprises. </br>  The goal of fostering and developing the socialist market </br>economic system is to realize the change in the circulation of </br>commodities and productive factors from planned distribution </br>relations to market exchange relations; to build up a unified, </br>open, competitive, orderly, complete, and developed big market; </br>and to ensure that the market mechanism plays a basic role in </br>allocating resources. Here, the first thing I want to talk </br>about is the essence of the new market system; the second is its </br>content and characteristics; and the third is its purpose. </br>These three together constitute the goal of the new market </br>system. </br>  At a superficial level, the market refers to sites of </br>transactions, and essentially speaking it is the sum total of </br>the exchange relations between commodities and money. </br>Therefore, to foster and develop the market system is not </br>simply to build so many market places, more importantly it is to </br>build new-type market exchange relations, and to change the </br>administrative distribution relations of commodities and factors </br>under the planned economic system into market exchange relations </br>built on the basis of equal opportunity, independent </br>transactions, fair competition, and equal exchange. </br>  A modern market system that meets the requirements of a </br>socialist market economy must have at least six characteristics: </br>First, it must be unified, and not divided. It breaks regional </br>blockades, departmental monopolies, and barriers between </br>departments and regions. It encourages free circulation of </br>commodities and factors, and removes artificial restrictions, </br>thus creating a nationwide unified market. Second, it must be </br>open and not closed. It is open at home, open to other cities </br>(counties) and provinces; and it is also open to foreign </br>countries, and achieves links between domestic and foreign </br>markets. Third, it must be competitive and not monopolistic. </br>It should have full and fair competition, and oppose monopoly, </br>especially administrative monopoly. Both commodity prices and </br>factor prices should be formed through market competition. </br>Fourth, it must be orderly and not chaotic. The market </br>principals are correct in their behavior, and their transaction </br>activities standardized and legalized. They carry out open </br>transactions under fair competition, with laws to abide by and </br>rules to follow, and a fine market order is built up. Fifth, it </br>must be complete and not fragmentary. It should have both a </br>consumer goods market and a means of production market, and it </br>should have a commodity market and a productive factors market; </br>it should have a spot market as well as a futures market; it </br>should create a visible market and attach importance to the </br>invisible market; it should have low-level markets and </br>high-level markets; it should have regional markets and a </br>nationwide market; it should develop domestic as well as foreign </br>markets. Sixth, it must be developed and not backward. On the </br>one hand, it should have a developed hardware system, including </br>market facilities, communications, telecommunications, banking, </br>godowns and storage, processing, and facilities for keeping food </br>fresh; on the other hand, it should have a developed software </br>system, including management, information, and rules and </br>regulations. Market operations are highly efficient, and </br>business costs are low. </br>  We are not fostering the market for the sake of fostering </br>the market. The fundamental purpose of fostering the market is </br>to create necessary conditions for the market to play a basic </br>role in allocating resources. As for the flow of commodities </br>and factors, only when the change from administrative </br>distribution relations to market exchange relations is </br>completed, and an improved and developed big market is built up </br>can a socialist market economy be operated normally and its role </br>be effectively brought into play. </br><H5>  Pricing Reform -- The Key to Developing the Market System </H5></br>  The core of market economy is the market, and the core of </br>the </br>market is prices. The basic role played by the market in </br>allocating resources is realized with the aid of the formation </br>mechanism and operational mechanism of market prices. Price </br>reform and market growth constrain and promote each other. </br>Freeing prices and changes in the price formation mechanism are </br>basic prerequisites for developing the market, because where </br>prices are set administratively, there can be no competition; </br>without competition, you cannot begin to talk about developing a </br>true market. Practice since reform has also proved that the </br>commodities for which prices are freed earlier are the </br>commodities for which the market develops faster; conversely, </br>the commodities for which prices are kept under tight control </br>are the commodities for which the market is not developed. </br>  Before reform, China implemented a highly centralized system </br>of administrative setting of prices, which brought about a </br>distorted pricing structure over a long period of time, thus </br>playing a reverse regulatory role in allocating resources. </br>After 15 years of reform, price reform has made substantial </br>progress, fundamental changes have taken place in the </br>overcentralized planned price structure, and prices of the great </br>majority of commodities and labor have been released. It can be </br>said that in the sphere of commodities and labor, the mechanism </br>under which prices are formed by the market occupies a leading </br>position. However, the task of price reform is not yet </br>finished; some prices suitable for freeing have not been freed; </br>there is still a two-tier price system for certain basic </br>products; prices within the plan are still somewhat low; the </br>reform of the price regulation and control system is relatively </br>delayed; in particular, the market does not yet play a dominant </br>role in the formation of interest rates, exchange rates, wages, </br>and land costs, and prices of productive factors do not yet </br>truly reflect their degree of scarcity. </br>  For a period of time to come, price reform will mainly </br>include three interrelated tasks: </br>  --To build up a price mechanism that takes prices </br>formed by the market as the dominant factor. This is the </br>core of price reform, and is also the basis on which the price </br>structure can constantly tend to be and continue being </br>relatively rational. It is necessary to continue expanding the </br>range in which prices are regulated by the market, strive to </br>create conditions before too long to basically free prices in </br>the sphere of commodities and labor suitable for freeing, and </br>abolish as soon as pos",FBIS3-59756,"Language: <F P=105> Japanese </F></br>Article Type:CSO </br></br>  [Text] </br><H5>  A. Overview </H5></br>  Japanese society and its economy continue to undergo </br>remarkable changes: diversification and sophistication in the </br>people's lifestyle and consciousness, changes in regional and </br>industrial structures, a society made up of increasingly more </br>elderly people, and globalization. In addition, there are calls </br>for worldwide cooperation in tackling global environmental </br>problems as an issue common to all of humanity. Towards the goal </br>of coping with these socio-economic changes and improving the </br>standard of living, technological development in the field of </br>transportation plays an increasingly important role. </br>  During FY93 the Ministry of Transport (MOT) will develop </br>railway technology, automotive technology, shipbuilding </br>technology, ocean-utilization technology, space-development </br>technology, and so forth, and will promote the development of </br>technology that covers many fields: improving traffic and </br>transportation safety, improving port and harbor construction </br>technology, mitigating natural disasters, improving </br>disaster-prevention technology, preventing pollution, preserving </br>the environment, etc. </br>  Table 1 summarizes the MOT-related Special Coordination </br>Funds </br>for Promoting S&amp;T in the FY93 budget. The subtotal of major </br>expenses for research institutes that are under the MOT's </br>control increased 3.3&percnt;. As for administrative department </br>expenses, transport technology R&amp;D expenses increased </br>3.6&percnt;, and </br>geostationary meteorological satellite operation expenses </br>increased 19.9&percnt;, resulting in a 19.1&percnt; increase in </br>the </br>subtotal.

Research at Major Research Institutes </H5></br>  Table 2 shows the items implemented as special research in </br>FY93, centering on MOT research institutes. This table also </br>includes research items based on budgets appropriated in lump </br>sums for other ministries and agencies and special accounts. </br>Below we will explain those items that warrant special mention, </br>centering on new research items. </br><H3>  1. Research on Structural Safety Evaluation To Accommodate </br>Lighter-Weight Ships </H3></br>  From now on, the demand for larger and faster ships is </br>expected to increase, and various types of high-speed ships are </br>being developed in Japan and other countries. With that, the </br>current safety standards for light-structure ships are being </br>revised by the International Maritime Organization (IMO), and </br>safety standards for the new high-speed ships are being studied </br>in Japan as well. This research involves investigating </br>structural safety, which is closely related to the safety of </br>high-speed ships. Because the existing design standards are not </br>applicable to some parts of the new types of ships, </br>necessitating safety evaluation by means of direct calculations, </br>the MOT will investigate weight-setting methods, structural </br>analysis methods, and strength evaluation methods for that; </br>clarify the necessary and sufficient conditions for ensuring </br>safety; and study methods of safety inspections based on actual </br>ship measurements. </br><H3>  2. Research on Aircraft Monitoring Methods for Shorter </br>Vertical Control Intervals </H3></br>  With the increase in the volume of air traffic, it is </br>expected that altitudes of 29,000 ft and higher 1,000-ft </br>vertical intervals will have to be adopted in order to </br>effectively use air space. With that there has arisen a need for </br>setting up a system that monitors, detects, and excludes </br>aircraft whose altitude maintenance error exceeds a certain </br>value. This effort involves researching the feasibility, </br>configuration, etc., of a monitoring system for the purpose of </br>establishing technology for monitoring aircraft altitude </br>maintenance error. </br><H3>  3. Research on Advanced Earthquake-Resistant Design Methods </br>for Seaside Facilities To Withstand Strong Earthquakes Directly </br>Beneath Tokyo </H3></br>  Recently, the increasing probability of a powerful </br>earthquake </br>occurring directly ben",FBIS3-20885,"Language: <F P=105> German </F></br>Article Type:BFN </br></br>  [Text] The Senate of the German Research Association [DFG] </br>has decided to set up 14 new priority programs and to extend </br>three others. In the Senate's opinion, 13 other programs out of </br>a total of 45 new applications and four for extensions deserved </br>funding in full on technical grounds but had to be rejected </br>because of the DFG's tight financial situation. The other </br>applications were also considered to be interesting and </br>attractive by the Senate. There will be three new priority </br>programs in the humanities and social sciences, and in the </br>biological sciences. Five new programs will be set up in the </br>natural sciences and one will be extended. There will be three </br>new programs in engineering sciences and two others will be </br>extended. </br>  Many of the priority programs deal with current problems. In </br>the social sciences and humanities, the program entitled ""Global </br>Environmental Changes: Social and Behavioral Science </br>Dimensions"" will examine the role of man as the cause and victim </br>of these problems. How does the individual cope with global </br>environmental changes? How do social groups and nations react? </br>This interdisciplinary program intends to develop environmental </br>and economic solutions. It will also analyze the endangered </br>ecosystem of the third world, with emphasis on population growth </br>and migration. The program entitled ""Efficient Organization of </br>Financial Markets and Institutions"" also deals with contemporary </br>problems. Germany's financial infrastructure is about to be </br>fundamentally reorganized so as to improve international </br>competitiveness. It is envisaged that the problems raised by </br>the reorganization will be identified and solved by coordinated </br>research. The theme of the third new priority program in the </br>field of social sciences and humanities is ""Information </br>Processing in a Social Context."" </br>  Priority programs in the biological sciences will be set up </br>on the following topics: ""Molecular Analysis of Regulation </br>Networks in Bacteria,"" ""Metabolism and Growth of Plants under </br>Increased CO2 Concentrations,"" and ""Genetic Analysis of Social </br>Systems."" In this last program, groups concerned with </br>sociobiology and molecular genetics are working together. They </br>are studying adaptation by natural and sexual selection during </br>the course of evolution. How do pairing systems and propagation </br>strategies develop in the animal kingdom? How can the division </br>of labor and altruism be explained? </br>  The five newly launched priority programs in the natural </br>sciences are: ""Ergodic Theory, Analysis and Efficient </br>Simulation of Dynamic systems,"" ""Theory of Relativistic Effects </br>in the Chemistry and Physics of Heavy Elements,"" ""Structure and </br>Function of Polyhedral Structures Composed of Main Group </br>Elements,"" ""Change in the Geo-biosphere over the Past 15,000 </br>Years - Continental Sediments as an Expression of Changing </br>Environmental Conditions,"" and ""Refractory Organic Acids in Open </br>Waters."" The ""II-VI Semiconductors"" program is being extended. </br>  The new programs in the engineering sciences are ""Mobile </br>Communications,"" ""Efficient Algorithms for Discrete Problems and </br>their Application,"" and ""Supercooled Metal Melts-Phase Selection </br>and Glass Formation."" The programs ""Ion and Plasma Surface </br>Technology,"" and ""Innovative Quality Assurance in Production"" </br>are being extended. Basic research and industry will work </br>together in the ""Mobile Communications"" program. Experts from </br>microelectronics and high frequency engineering intend to solve </br>the problems of transmitting and switching long-distance calls. </br>  The funding for the 17 newly launched and extended programs </br>amounts to 48.2 million German marks [DM]. In 1994, the DFG </br>will support 104 priority programs altogether with subsidies </br>totaling DM224.9 million. A typical feature of these funding </br>procedures is the supraregional cooperation between the </br>participating scientists. Researchers from various institutions </br>and disciplines work together for a limited time, mostly six </br>years. In addition to special research fields, priority </br>programs are the most important method of promoting </br>interdisciplinary coordinated research. </br></br>",FBIS3-23649,"Language: <F P=105> Russian </F></br>Article Type:CSO </br></br><F P=106> [Article by Major-General Yevgeniy Korotchenko, candidate of </F></br>military sciences and professor, and Colonel Nikolay Plotnikov, </br>officer graduate student at the Military Academy of the General </br>Staff of the Armed Forces of the Russian Federation, under ""A </br>Look at the Problem"" rubric: ""Information Is Also a Weapon: </br>About What Must Not Be Forgotten in Working with Personnel""] </br>  [Text] It is not without reason that the mass media are </br>called the ""fourth power."" The resolution of political, </br>economic, and defense tasks depends to a considerable extent </br>upon the fullness of information and its objectivity and </br>dependability. </br>  As everyone knows, however, information can be used not just </br>for creative purposes. It is no accident that in the </br>military-political confrontation of states and in other kinds of </br>foreign and domestic conflicts we are now seeing a tendency </br>toward a shift in the center of gravity away from traditional </br>methods of force and means of combat toward nontraditional </br>methods, including information. Their impact is imperceptible </br>and appears gradually. It is less burdensome economically and is </br>not dangerous ecologically. But the main thing is that it is </br>difficult to get rid of. More and more often they will turn </br>openly to military force when all other available possibilities </br>for influence are already exhausted or military actions will </br>likely be brief and, as they say, certain of victory. A graphic </br>example of this is the war in 1990-91 in the zone of the Persian </br>Gulf. </br>  Thus, today information and information technologies are </br>becoming a real weapon. A weapon not just in a metaphoric sense </br>but in a direct sense as well. Natural questions are: What is </br>the objective of the information action, under what principle </br>does it work, and what kinds of dangerous effects of information </br>are there? </br>  One of the basic targets of the influence of information is </br>the consciousness and mind of man. Depending on the objectives </br>being pursued, the scope of the actions, the nature and content </br>of the tasks being resolved, and the forces and means being </br>applied, these people may be specific persons (state and </br>political leaders, employees of special services, military </br>personnel, workers in law enforcement agencies, scientists, and </br>members of political parties and movements) or particular social </br>groups (workers, entrepreneurs, young people, housewives, etc.). </br>But under the conditions when the system for the management of </br>the state has been disrupted and a situation of public-political </br>and socioeconomic instability has been created in the country or </br>in a specific region, the entire population may be the target of </br>its influence. </br>  The basis of the information action is a specially selected </br>or developed information put into circulation with the help of </br>well-defined and above all psychological methods and means at </br>the proper time by some state or other or particular political </br>forces against a selected target. Especially great here is the </br>role of negative information or disinformation. Let us remember </br>how the bloody events began in one of the former Central Asian </br>republics of the USSR. A rumor (""They slaughtered our people at </br>the bazaar because of a glass of strawberries"") falling on the </br>still-smoldering embers of interethnic disagreements about </br>purely routine matters provoked mass killings of completely </br>innocent women, children, and old men and led to many thousands </br>of refugees. </br>  The events of recent years abroad and in our country show </br>that a special role in the influence of information on the </br>public consciousness belongs to television, above all, </br>apparently, because it gives the viewers the illusion of </br>participating in what is taking place on the screen. Moreover, </br>we live under conditions in which the receipt of information </br>from other official sources is made more difficult. A very </br>dangerous phenomenon in this respect was the crisis in the </br>newspaper and magazine business, the dramatic decline in the </br>circulation of printed publications, and the worsening of their </br>distribution. </br>  Here, for example, is how television was used in the </br>development of public opinion at the very beginning of the </br>bloody events in Bosnia. On one of the days, the television </br>companies of many countries showed the mortaring of peaceful </br>inhabitants of Sarayevo--Muslims standing in line for bread. And </br>it all happened live, as they say, as though those who filmed </br>the chilling scenes were informed of the coming events in </br>advance. And is it possbile that this is how it was? They </br>blamed the Serbs for the crime. And many television viewers </br>hundreds or thousands of kilometers away from the place of the </br>tragedy, not to mention the Muslims of Bosnia, certainly </br>believed this. Later, however, UN workers were able to determine </br>that in reality the bloody provocation was the work of Muslim </br>militants who had selected their coreligionists as targets. But </br>the deed, as they say, had already been done. </br>  It is possible to present a great many such examples of </br>falsification and manipulation of facts, including in the public </br>mass media. </br>  Television and radio are becoming the predominant means of </br>information in the army as well. And if one takes into account </br>the growing psychological tension in the society, the loss of </br>moral guidelines and values by most of our citizens, and the </br>uncertainty about tomorrow, then television--if its standards </br>are set by commercial interests as is done here--can also become </br>an agent for social degradation. The scenes of violence on the </br>screen, the propaganda of profit by any means, the </br>permissiveness and disdain for the law, the pornography, and the </br>forgetting of the many centuries of Russian history hardly </br>strengthened the moral foundations of the army. </br>  The techniques for the introduction of negative information </br>and disinformation into the consciousness of people are quite </br>varied. They may conditionally be divided into obvious </br>techniques, unconvincing methods, delayed perception, </br>repetition, argued methods, and techniques for resolute </br>conclusions. </br>  Obvious techniques are those that do not require additional </br>information for the understanding of the basic content of the </br>material being disseminated. Assertions are one example. They </br>represent firm statements presented as obvious facts not </br>requiring proof. Here any complex situation may be simplified to </br>the point where, let us say, the cause of all troubles </br>(economic, political, military, etc.) becomes quite obvious. </br>Thus, for example, the culprit in the economic crisis in a </br>number of republics of the former USSR may be declared to be </br>either persons of another nationality, so-called ""migrants,"" or </br>people with a different political orientation. And this, as </br>everyone knows, was one of the reasons for the national-civil </br>wars in Moldova, the Transcaucasus, and Tajikistan.... </br>  Unconvincing methods operate under the principle: ""You can </br>believe it or not, I do not vouch for its authenticity."" </br>Particularly outstanding among these methods are insinuations </br>employed to establish or evoke in the target of the action </br>doubts about particular ideas, social groups, or individual </br>personalities with the purpose of producing a schism in the </br>midst of the target group. This is usually done through </br>allusions, half-truths, and allegories so that the target of the </br>action will draw his own conclusions but in such a way that is </br>necessary for the one disseminating the information. The themes </br>of the insinuations may be political views, socioeconomic, </br>national, and religious differences, the personal lives of </br>undesirable representatives of the state and military </br>leadership, power structures, leaders of political parties, and </br>entrepreneurs, the sources of their income, and the like. </br>  In the use of methods of delayed perception, the target of </br>the action perceives the basic content of the information only </br>after becoming familiar with secondary materials. The </br>premeditated concealment of certain information until it is no </br>longer of current interest may serve as an example here. </br>  Methods of repetition make it possible, figuratively </br>speaking, to ""pound"" information into the subconciousness of the </br>individual, the destructive action of which may subsequently be </br>initiated at the proper time with the help of some slogan, </br>appeal, combination of words, or symbols. </br>  Arguments used in a negative information action are </br>presented </br>as a reason explaining the behavior or thinking of the target of </br>the action. In so doing, it is sufficient to set different </br>accents, remove some ""inconvenient"" details, and make some </br>selective passes and the same argument can have a different </br>sound to it and accordingly and different effect. </br>  In speaking of the negative information effect on the </br>personnel of the army and navy, it is necessary to pay special </br>attention to rumors. Let us see what rumors represent, what are </br>the reasons for their formation, how they influence the </br>attitudes, behavior, and life aims of the individual, and what </br>measures can be taken to counteract them. </br>  People who encounter something that they cannot </br>understand--real or invented but, as they see it, </br>important--always strive to get rid of mental tensi"
