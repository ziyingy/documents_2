# Notes on Sormunen Relevance Judgements

-------
Summary
-------

   The Sormunen qrels are a re-judging of 41 topics from TREC-7 and
   TREC-8 on a 4-point ordinal scale (0, 1, 2, 3). They are available
   in the file
      sormunen_qrels

   Thanks to Eero Sormunen and Heikki Keskustalo for providing the 
   data.

-----------
The Details
-----------

The file
   src/trec41.tar
contains the qrels created by Eero Sormunen (as described in Sormunen, "Liberal
relevance criteria of TREC: Counting on negligible documents?", SIGIR 2002), 
provided by Eero Sormunen and Heikki Keskustalo on 10/9/12.

These files have been extracted into the directory 
   sormunen_qrels_orig/

The relevance assessment files are:
   % wc sormunen_qrels_orig/qrels*

    2400    9600   49621 sormunen_qrels_orig/qrels_123
    1204    4816   25028 sormunen_qrels_orig/qrels_23
     391    1564    8273 sormunen_qrels_orig/qrels_3

Note that the qrels files only indicate binary relevance in trec_eval qrels
format, and are "nested". For example, qrels_123 contains assessments for 2400
documents, with a "1" for any documents rated 1, 2 or 3. The file qrels_23 contains
assessments for  1204 documents, namely those with a rating of 2 or 3. Finally, qrels_3 
contains 391 documents, only those with a rating of 3.

Note that this tar file does *not* include explicitly re-judged
non-relevant documents.  These were provided separately by Heikki
Keskustalo (heikki.keskustalo@uta.fi) via email on 13/9/12, and are in
the file 
   sormunen_nonrel_orig/qrels_nonrel
(The directory also contains the same data in HTML marked-up format.)

As the content of this file is *not* in standard trec_eval format, the
script 
   process/convert_nonrel.sh 
transforms the data as required, with the output stored in
   process/conv/nonrel.conv

   % wc process/conv/nonrel.conv
    3715   14860  107735 nonrel.conv

The R script process/merge.r unifies these relevance files into a single
multi-level trec_eval format file, called
   sormunen_qrels

According to Heikki Keskustalo, "Please find attached the non-relevant
judgments - same data in two different formats (2 files).  So, the final number
of graded judgments is: 391 3-level, 813 2-level, 1196 1-level, and 3715
0-level (non-relevant) judgements made." 

This corresponds to the content of the file sormunen_qrels:
   % awk '{if($4 == 0) A++; if ($4 == 1) B++; if ($4 == 2) C++; if ($4 == 3) D++}END{print A, B, C, D}' sormunen_qrels

   3715 1196 813 391
