   Relevance corpus:

   (1) The graded "TREC 7 AND 8" database contains 41 topics 
   (topic numbers #351, #353, ... #448) and relevance judgments
   with 4 relevance grades (i.e., non-relevant, marginally relevant,
   fairly relevant, or highly relevant documents) intellectually
   judged with respect to a database containing about half-a-million
   English documents.

   (2) 2400 documents of the collection are at least marginally 
   relevant with respect to the the 41 topics.  These relevance 
   judgments are distributed, regarding the four distinct
   document sources (FBIS, FR94, FT, and LA Times) as follows:
    FBIS: 759 documents,
    FR94: 143 documents,
    FT: 752 documents,
    LA: 746 documents.
    Sum total: 2400 documents.                                 .

   13.6.2007 written by Eija Airio: inconsistences observed:

The trec relevance file TrecUtaRels_41Topics.txt included three
inconsistences.  They were corrected in a following way:
408;FBIS4-26836;3
408;FBIS4-26836;1
-> 408;FBIS4-26836;2
408;FR940114-0-00046;3
408;FR940114-0-00046;2
-> 408;FR940114-0-00046;2
428;FT943-4802;3
428;FT943-4802;2
-> 428;FT943-4802;2

   Trec multigraded relevance data in "trec_eval" format
   is available in the following files:

 Relevance grades 1, 2 and 3: file
   "qrels_123"
  
 Relevance grades 2 and 3: file
   "qrels_23"

 Relevance grade 3: file
   "qrels_3"

 Based on these relevance corpus files one can observe that:
 * 2400 relevant documents (at least marginally relevant) 
   have been observed (out of 6122 reassessed documents)
   as follows:
     --  1196 marginally relevant documents (R=1)
     --  813 fairly relevant documents (R=2)
     --  391 highly relevant documents (R=3)
   The remaining documents evaluated by the judges
   (that is, 3722 documents) were deemed as non-relevant.

 15 Mar 2012 written by Heikki Keskustalo:

 The graded English UTA data is described in
 Sormunen (2002) "Liberal Relevance Criteria of TREC -
 Counting on Negligible Documents", SIGIR 2002;
 at this stage the relevance figures reported were
 smaller.

 Before iconsistences were observed in June 2007, 
 some publications report incorrect relevance figures
 as follows:

   2403 relevant documents (at least marginally relevant) out of 
   6122 reassessed documents as follows:
     -- 3719 non-relevant documents (R=0)
     -- 1197 marginally relevant documents (R=1)
     --  812 fairly relevant documents (R=2)
     --  394 highly relevant documents (R=3)

  However, since June 2007 these figures must NOT be reported.
