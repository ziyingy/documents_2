  [Text] When a delegation of senior State Department and 
immigration officials arrives in Beijing tomorrow, their meeting 
with Chinese counterparts will not be taking place under the 
best of circumstances. The United States had hoped to be doing 
nothing more painful than smoothing over minor disputes with the 
Chinese on how to combat alien smuggling, and on arrangements 
for sending more of the sorry boatloads back home. But the 
talks will now be taking place in the shadow of the mysterious 
ship which dropped off more than 100 Fujianese at the Virginia 
coast last month and disappeared into the night, embarrassing 
authorities who had congratulated themselves that last year's 
alien smuggling crisis was over. 
  Intelligence reports indicate that other boats may be at sea 
bearing human cargoes whose eventual destination is the United 
States. It is clear last year's high-profile defeats for the 
smugglers -- most notably the Golden Venture and East Wood 
incidents -- plus China's reported crackdown on activities on 
home soil have put only temporary hurdles in the smugglers' path. 
  Quite apart from last week's raids in Maryland and New York, 
which revealed the safe passage of the latest boat, the SUNDAY 
MORNING POST has learned smuggling activities are still rampant. 
  More than 100 illegal Chinese immigrants have been rounded 
up 
by border patrol officers in Puerto Rico this year. All had 
taken a one-day boat journey from the nearby Dominican Republic 
after tortuous round-the world routes via Hong Kong, Europe and 
South America. The island has become the latest target of the 
smuggling gangs because of its easy access by sea, its less 
heavily-patrolled waters, and the fact that it comes under U.S. 
jurisdiction, meaning the immigrants can fly on to the U.S. 
mainland without needing documents. "It's a very nice way of 
coming in the back door," one immigration intelligence official 
said. 
  Last week, 38 Chinese, mostly Fujianese, were discovered on 
a 
beach in early morning -- presumably waiting for their guide to 
turn up. They told investigators they had flown from Hong Kong 
either to London or Paris, then on to the Dominican Republic. 
There they waited several weeks before taking a small boat for 
the short trip to Puerto Rico. Another group discovered in 
January said they had spent many weeks passing through Brazil 
and Bolivia before reaching the Dominican Republic. 
  Investigators believed smugglers began using the new entry 
point after the failure of huge shiploads to make it safely to 
the U.S. However, the authorities believe that for every person 
caught, scores may be passing through undetected. 
  Investigators are finding that the aliens probably left 
China 
with valid exit documents, but acquired fake visas to enter 
transit countries in Europe and South America. 
  One immigration official said the authorities had been 
caught 
unawares by the audacity of the smugglers. "From my 
perspective, there has been a false sense of security. I think 
we may have let our guard down," the official said. 
  "The feeling was, we had some successes like the East Wood 
(intercepted last year off the Marshall Islands), and the Golden 
Venture, which was terrible publicity for the smugglers. But 
the series of victories was more luck than anything else. The 
smugglers have since changed their tactics, using smaller loads 
and different routes." He said that tough legislation, promised 
last year by President Bill Clinton, had "lost its momentum". 
  Although the record on catching smugglers has been 
reasonable, the punishments inflicted are not great. For 
instance, the captain and crew of the Golden Venture have been 
allowed to plead guilty to minor alien smuggling charges, and 
may escape with a few months in prison. 
  Likewise, many of the 15 or so alleged members of the New 
York- based Fuk Ching gang said to be behind the transporting 
and kidnapping of last year's boatloads -- are negotiating 
guilty plea bargains with prosecutors. 
  A recent Justice Department memorandum confirms the 
administration has partly retreated. In it, Assistant 
Attorney-General Sheila Anthony suggests tagging certain 
provisions, such as increased penalties for alien smuggling, to 
existing bills rather than putting forward a controversial new 
set of laws. 
  Streamlining of the asylum process is occurring without the 
need for new legislation. 
  The problem is being attacked only after the illegal 
immigrants have been smuggled in. Gangs appear unconcerned by 
plans to deny work permits to asylum seekers for longer periods, 
or to charge applicants a processing fee. The immigration 
official said the alien smugglers worked under such a "complex 
web" of contacts and alliances that the only way to beat them 
was to put resources into intelligence work. 
  "I do think we will see more boats this summer. They've had 
time to regroup," he said. "But patrolling the shores is only 
really a last resort. The key is criminal intelligence, getting 
informants and penetrating the gangs." 
  Last week's raids on the safe houses came after a relative 
of 
one illegal immigrant tipped off the FBI that the group was 
being held hostage and threatened for the US$30,000 (HK$232,000) 
smuggling fee. Without the call, the aliens would eventually 
have melted seamlessly into the shadowy underworld that 
contained millions of illegal workers like them.
