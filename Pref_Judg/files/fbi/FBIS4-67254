  [Text] The Constitutional Court today upheld the ruling on 
personal drug consumption. The ruling will not affect the 
sentences of those who store, produce, manufacture, distribute, 
or are linked in any other way to drug trafficking activities. 
Fernando Ramos has the story: [begin recording] 
  Ramos: As for the ruling that authorized 
possession of drugs for personal use, the Constitutional Court 
emphasized we cannot think of repression as the only mechanism 
to solve this problem. In several of the ruling's paragraphs, 
the Constitutional Court insisted it ruled according to what the 
Constitution and the laws stipulate. 
  Constitutional Court President Jorge Arango: This 
is nothing unusal; it complies with the duties of the 
Constitutional Court. As for the consumption of potentially 
toxic substances such as alcohol, tobacco, and drugs, we count 
on education, which is part of the ruling. 
  Ramos: The ruling also stipulates that the 
National Congress will be able to legislate to find measures to 
control drug consumption. 
  Constitutional Court Magistrate Vladimiro Naranjo: 
Within the Legislative Branch, the National Congress is free to 
take the initiative in this field. There are no reasons why the 
Constitutional Court has to set some standards; this is a 
legislative initiative. 
  Ramos: The four dissenting votes were also 
submitted to the Constitutional Court Secretariat General. The 
reasons why some magistrates voted against the legalization of 
drugs for personal use are explained in those documents. 
  Constitutional Court Magistrate Hernando Herrera: 
I believe the right to free personality development cannot 
overstep the rights of society, family, youth, children, and 
women, because our Constitution stipulates the prevalence of 
general interest over individual rights. [end recording]
