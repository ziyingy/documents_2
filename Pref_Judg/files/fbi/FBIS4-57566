  [Text] Expressing his agreement with an opinion voiced by 
U.S. Ambassador to Bolivia Charles Bowers, Social Defense 
National Secretary Mario Solis noted that so far, Law 1008 has 
achieved good results and met its goal of struggling against 
drug trafficking. Solis was referring to remarks made in Sucre 
by U.S. Ambassador Charles Bowers, who noted that Law 1008 is a 
"fair and good" instrument. 
  At odds with the citizenry's nearly unanimous position that 
this law should be changed, Ambassador Bowers prefers the 
implementation of the law to remain unchanged. 
  For his part, Mario Solis emphasized that Law 1008 has met 
its goal and become a key element in the war being waged against 
the scourge of drug trafficking. 
  Nevertheless, Solis indicated that now it is necessary "to 
improve" this legal instrument through a total consensus 
involving all social groups of the population. Solis added that 
this improvement is closely linked to the amendments that might 
be implemented, based on the experiences gathered so far. 
  Asked about the possible approval of a decree regulating the 
legal marketing and industrialization of coca leaves, Solis said 
he is satisfied because this government measure will benefit 
coca producers. Solis added: "This is a good regulation that 
approves coca industrialization only in areas that traditionally 
have produced it."
