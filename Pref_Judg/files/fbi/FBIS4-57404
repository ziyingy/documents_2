  [Text] A delegation of Colombian businessmen just made a 
visit to Cuba, where they analyzed investment possibilities in 
Cuban production and service sectors. The Colombian businessmen 
worked on identifying investment possibilities in the tourism, 
sugar, pharmaceutical, and biotechnology industries, the 
agricultural-livestock sector, and basic industries, among 
others. 
  Representatives from the Ministry of Foreign Investment and 
Economic Cooperation, and the Cuban Chamber of Commerce provided 
the visitors with extensive information and debated the ideas 
proposed by the Colombian delegation on future joint projects. 
The Colombian delegation also learned of Cuban legislation 
regarding foreign investments and preparations for the eventual 
approval of a law for mutual promotion and protection of that 
type of business. Part of the group participated in the Cuba-94 
tourism convention which is being held in Varadero, since that 
sector contains immediate possibilities for bilateral 
cooperation.
