  [Text] The controversy between the government and 
Prosecutor General Gustavo de Greiff continues. Justice 
Minister Andres Gonzalez also rejected the prosecutor general's 
actions today. The government's discontent over statements by 
Gustavo de Greiff, who has accused several state officials of 
being subservient, continues. After President Cesar Gaviria's 
statement demanding respect from the prosecutor general, de 
Greiff seemed to have turned his back on the controversy today. 
Meanwhile, his position still generates controversy. 
  Begin Gonzalez recording: No Colombian is 
subservient. We are independent and honorable people, and the 
first to be so is our president. [end recording] 
  The issue of the study of drugs legalization, which the 
prosecutor general has defended on several occasions, is not 
viewed favorably by the government. The gap between the 
government and the prosecutor seems to widen. 
  Begin Gabriel de Vega, National Drug Directorate 
director, recording: Legalization would increase 
consumption due to the availability. It is definitely an option 
the Colombian Government is not considering. [end recording] 
  It has been learned that a meeting of rapprochement between 
the president and the prosecutor general, with government 
officials and judicial branch representatives present, might be 
held within the next few hours to iron out any differences.
