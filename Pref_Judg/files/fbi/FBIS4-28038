  [Text] The suppression drive launched by the Burmese 
government in an area opposite Chiang Rai Province is directed 
against opium warlord Khun Sa's Muang Tai Army (MTA) forces, not 
democratic groups in Shan State, Office of the Narcotic Control 
Board secretary-general Chawalit Yotmani said yesterday. 
  Pol Gen Chawalit said Khun Sa's struggle was not a 
democratic 
cause. 
  He said narcotics traffickers who were recently arrested in 
Chiang Mai Province and had ammunition seized were Khun Sa's 
subordinates and should not be called "fighters for democracy". 
  The ammunition was intended for exchange with drugs, he 
said, 
adding he had no idea where they came from. 
  Academics have proposed that measures be put in place to 
control the ethics of politicians, but Pol Gen Chawalit thought 
the moral standards of MPs could improve gradually. 
  He said it was beyond his responsibilities to comment on 
what 
should be done to prevent politicians from becoming involved in 
the narcotics trade. 
  He also said the committee responsible for drafting the 
anti-money laundering bill had already met once and would meet 
again this Monday. 
  It was agreed at the first meeting that the legislation 
should deal initially with "dirty money" acquired through the 
narcotics trade, he said.
