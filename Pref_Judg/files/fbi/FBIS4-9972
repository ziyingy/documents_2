  [Text] Environment Minister Henrique Brandao Cavalcanti was 
installed this morning. He is a civil engineer who was the 
coordinator for Amazon affairs. Brandao Cavalcanti said the 
policy of his ministry will continue unchanged. 
  [Begin Brandao Cavalcanti recording] The first step is to 
continue Minister Ricupero's work. In the case of the Amazon 
region, I will continue the work of the National Amazon Region 
Council, which has a schedule already established for the 10 
work-groups that cover the various areas. We will strictly 
comply with this schedule. As to the environment, there are 
many aspects. Minister Ricupero has expressed concern for the 
multiple aspects of the issue: the forests and the national 
parks which call for the establishment of some priorities. To 
meet this objective, I will consult experts who are already 
working in the ministry and who are responsible for them. [end

  Henrique Brandao Cavalcanti will stimulate the 
decentralization process and make action in the environmental 
area more effective. He believes the Environment Ministry will 
develop more as a result of Minister Ricupero's installation as 
finance minister.
