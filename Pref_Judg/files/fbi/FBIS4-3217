  [Text] Yichang, April 16 (CNS)--Head of the materials 
division of the Three Gorges Project Corporation Mr. Shi Zhenyu 
said that the corporation hoped that businessmen would actively 
compete for contracts for the project and they would be welcome 
to supply material products of high quality. 
  The project is the biggest hydroelectric power project in 
the 
world with total investment put at RMB [renminbi] 50.9 billion. 
Its enormous dam will require a large amount of construction 
materials including one million tonnes of steel products, six 
million tonnes of cement, 1.3 million tonnes of special local 
ash, one million tonnes of oil products, 35,000 to 50,000 cubic 
metres of timber and 35,000 tonnes of other materials. These 
construction materials will cost some RMB 20 billion. 
  In order to achieve the goal put forward by Premier Li Peng 
that the Three Gorges project should have top-grade materials, 
top-grade management and top-grade construction, the materials 
division will connect the planned supply with its purchasing so 
as to chose the best materials for the project.
