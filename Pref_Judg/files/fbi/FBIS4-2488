  [Text] Lhasa, April 11 (XINHUA) -- The ongoing Three Rivers 
Comprehensive Development Project in Southwest China's Tibet 
Autonomous Region has begun to yield good returns. 
  A total of 22 projects on the middle reaches of the Yarlung 
Zangbo, Nyangqu and Lhasa Rivers have been completed over the 
past three years. 
  The projects include the building or expansion of four 
reservoirs with a combined holding capacity of 26.12 million cu 
m of water, two hydropower stations with a total installed 
capacity of 2,200 kw, land improvement and afforestation. 
  In the three years the total investment in the projects has 
been 240 million yuan (about 30 million U.S. dollars). Over 
1,333 ha of low-yield farm land have been improved, and over 
6,666 ha of land planted with trees. 
  The construction of water conservancy, energy, transport, 
technology, farm, animal husbandry and forestry projects along 
the rivers have greatly improved local farming conditions and 
the ecological environment. 
  Last year the production of grain, rape, meat and milk in 
the 
project areas were respectively 62.06, 79.2, 17.47 and 21.24 
percent of the totals for the region.
