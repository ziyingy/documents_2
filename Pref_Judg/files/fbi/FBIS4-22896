  [Abstract] Earlier mammal studies aimed at evaluating the 
genetic consequences of the elevated radiation background in the 
Chernobyl nuclear power plant area are continued, and the 
genetic variations in mice exposed in 1989 to 14-, 22-, and 
34-day irradiation within the 10-km Chernobyl nuclear power 
plant zone are examined; an attempt is made to investigate the 
dependence of the genetic effect in sex cells on the exposure 
duration, animal hemotype, and the ontogenesis stage affected by 
the exposure. To this end, (CBAxC57BL)F[.sub]1[/] hybrid mice 
of both sexes and sexually mature C57BL males in wire mesh cages 
are studied at a surface dose (measured by a DP-5 radiation 
monitor) averaging 60 mR/h. In addition, DTG-4 and MKDT 
radiation monitors were used for determining the absorbed 
_g_-radiation dose and the cumulative absorbed _g_- and 
_b_-radiation. The genetic effect of radiation on the sex cell 
was evaluated by the dominant lethal mutation (DLM) rate 
characterized by the embryo mortality before and after 
implantation; by the frequency of abnormal spermia heads (AGS), 
and by the rate of reciprocal translocations (RT) induced at the 
diakinesis stage. The study reveals a linear dependence of the 
induced effect on the absorbed dose magnitude. Among the animals 
irradiated during the embryonic development period, a male who 
is heterozygotic with respect to the reciprocal translocation is 
identified. No unambiguous relationship between the genetic 
effect and mice genotype was revealed. The findings can be used 
for quantitative estimates of the genetic danger from radiation 
for humans. The authors are grateful to V.S. Lysenkova, G.A. 
Vilkina, K.N. Yarovoy, and A.I. Shaks for assistance. Figures 4;
