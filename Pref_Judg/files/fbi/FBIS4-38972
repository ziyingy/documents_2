  [Text] [No dateline as received] -- A survey conducted by 
the Institute of Sociology of the National Academy of Sciences 
reveals a troubled demographic situation in Ukraine. Birth rate 
has fallen from 12.1 children per 1,000 residents in 1991 to 
10.8 per 1,000 in 1993. The number of deaths per 1,000 has 
risen from 12.9 in 1991 to 14.2 in 1993, twice exceeding 
mortality rates in Western Europe, Canada, and Japan. 
Population growth rate in the past three years has been 
negative. In 1991, the growth indicator was (- 0.8), in 1992 
(- 1.9), and in 1993 (- 3.4) per 1,000. 
  Child mortality is far above the European average. In early 
1994, death rate among children was 14.4 per 1,000, with the 
average rate in developed countries at 3.5 to 7.0 per 1,000. 
Only 30 percent of Ukrainian babies are born healthy.
