  [Text] Economic opening in Cuba continues to be one of the 
Cuban Government's greatest challenges. Colombia is a good 
example for them in this field. That is why Carlos Lage Davila, 
vice president of the Council of State and visible head of 
Cuba's policy, has come to Colombia. 
  Lage also is responsible for the economic policy of Fidel 
Castro's government. His proposal to rescue the island from 
economic backwardness after holding relations with socialist 
countries for more than 30 years can be summed up as follows: 
  [Begin Lage recording] We must seek new markets, open the 
door to capital investment, and develop new economic activities 
for the country's future. [end recording] 
  Lage added, however, that tourism, one important aspect of 
the economic opening that is being discussed with Colombian 
industrialists, is not for all Cubans. 
  [Begin Lage recording] It is true we have given 
international 
tourism priority status. The country is going through a 
difficult situation. Consequently, we must build facilities, 
incur expenses, and make sacrifices to bring in foreign 
currency. [end recording] 
  The official said that the Cuban opening is straightforward 
and that soon the world's markets will be handling Cuban 
products other than sugar and tobacco.
