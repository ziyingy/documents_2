  [Text] One of this month's strategic goals of the Sugar 
Industry Ministry is to plant the more than 18,000 caballerias 
of sugarcane projected for the current spring campaign, in order 
to guarantee the sugarcane supply of forthcoming harvests. 
Fulfilling this plan will also make it possible to create the 
necessary conditions to plant no less that 30,000 caballerias 
throughout the year. This is an essential step toward 
stabilizing the seed supply.
