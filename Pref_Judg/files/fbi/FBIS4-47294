  [Abstract] Minimizing the threshold temperature difference 
detectable by infrared imaging is considered, the detectable 
temperature difference being the principal performance 
characteristic of an infrared receiver and its minimum threshold 
being theoretically attainable in the absence of atmospheric 
noise and background interference. The noise equivalent 
temperature difference (NETD) is represented as the product of 
three terms containing the radiation wavelength, both focal 
length and diameter of the objective, the surface area of a 
photosensitive element, and the photoelectron storage time, also 
the numerical spectral density of photons emitted by an absolute 
black body and a parameter characterizing the degeneracy of the 
photon flux emitted by an absolute black body at a temperature 
T. It has been assumed here that objects within the field of 
vision radiate heat as if they were absolute black bodies, that 
the diameter of the objective is smaller than its focal length, 
that the infrared imaging device includes a photon receiver with 
a long-wave sensitivity edge _l_[.sub]m[/] and a cooled mask 
preventing incidence of extraneous radiation on the 
photosensitive surfaces, and that the photosensitive element in 
each channel is followed by a photoelectron storage device 
ensuring optimal filtration for extraction of the signal from 
its mixture with white noise in the background radiation. The 
dependence of the thus defined noise equivalent temperature 
difference (NETD) on the long-wave sensitivity edge of the 
photon receiver is evaluated for an infrared imaging device with 
a single photosensitive element and with image scanning along 
both orthogonal axes, assuming that photoelectrons are stored 
within a time almost equal to the frame period. As the 
sensitivity edge shifts to longer waves, the specific NETD* 
first decreases very fast to a minimum (slightly above 
5x10[.sup]-8[/] k.cm.s[.sup]1/2[/] when the sensitivity 
edge is 28.2 æm and the blackbody temperature is 292 K) and 
then almost negligibly increases. Fluctuations of the incident 
radiation flux and nonhomogeneity of the photosensitive surfaces 
tend to raise the minimum temperature difference detectable by 
infrared imaging. It is also shown that the information content 
of infrared images is smaller when the temperature of objects is 
lower. References 4.
