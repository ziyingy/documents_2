  [Text] Here is a flash just in from the news desk -- a 
military source has stated the following: 
  A local media organ this afternoon carried a report saying 
that Army units are surrounding the headquarters of the Lebanese 
Forces [LF] in Ghidras. This report is inaccurate and untrue. 
We would like to clarify that the Army's recent movements in 
the Kasrawan area are part of a field plan to consolidate 
security in the region following several incidents and rumors 
that have caused concern among the citizens. The security 
source assures the public that the security situation is stable, 
despite some incidents that seek to undermine the morale of the 
citizens. The security agencies are looking into these 
incidents to uncover those behind them.
