  [Text] Tokyo, June 14 KYODO -- A government panel has 
drafted an ambitious space development blueprint that foresees 
manned outposts on the Moon within three decades and calls for 
sending artists and intellectuals as well as space specialists 
into space, panel sources said Tuesday [14 June]. 
  The new grand design for Japan's space program will be 
included in a report to be announced as early as July by the 
Space Activities Commission's task force responsible for drawing 
up the nation's long-term space policy outline, the sources said. 
  The report will illustrate Japan's emboldened posture in 
space development after the February success in launching the 
H-2 rocket, the first large rocket built solely with domestic 
technology, they said. The proposals will be incorporated into 
the government's space development platform which is expected to 
be revised for the first time in five years. The report 
stipulates two groups of targets for space development projects, 
to be achieved in 15 years and in 30 years, respectively. 
  The commission has fashioned a 15-year plan for bringing 
back 
rocks and ice from Mercury and other small planets and also for 
geological research on Mars and the Moon using surface rovers. 
After 30 years, Japan should have completed, with international 
cooperation if possible, a manned station and an astronomical 
observatory on the Moon, the report says. 
  For fostering the necessary technology for such a grandiose 
project, the report proposes active participation in the 
U.S.-inspired international space station program, expected to 
be completed in early 21st century. It also stresses the 
importance of sending nonexperts like intellectuals and artists 
to the planned space station to make space activities more 
familiar to the public. 
  The report cites probes on the Moon and the use of solar 
energy in space as principal new space ventures that Japan 
should embark on. For the lunar probes, observations of the 
Moon surface by satellites and the bringing of Moon soil back to 
the earth are envisaged as goals to be achieved within 15 years. 
Japan should play an active part in any international projects 
for building Moon stations, it says. 
  As for the transportation technology demanded by the 
project, 
the report calls for development of a spruced-up version of the 
H-2 rocket that is twice as powerful as the current model within 
10 years as a means to launch Japan's own unmanned space 
shuttles. The space shuttles (Hope, or H-2 orbiting plane) 
should be augmented for manned missions within 30 years, the 
report says.
