<F P=106> [Editorial: ``Defensive Drug Initiative''] </F>
  [Text] The government calls it an action plan. But there 
are more words than action in the proposal for a drug policy 
reorientation that was presented by three ministries yesterday 
as a token of what four government parties can agree on. And it 
is not much. The best that can be said of the plan is that it 
will hardly make the situation worse. The worst: that it will 
not make it much better either. 
  The vague government initiative must be assessed in the 
light 
of a collective realization that the drug policy that has been 
pursued for the past 20 years has failed. It has not limited the 
number of drug abusers; it has not helped the country's 
intravenous drug users, now 10,000 strong; and it has not 
reduced drug-related crimes. On the contrary. 
  That is why responsible doctors and police personnel have 
also contested the entire strategy behind the drug policy. The 
viewpoint is that only through supervised provision of 
drugs--and methadone--can one make life bearable for the 
``incurable'' abusers and at the same time stop the drug-related 
crime wave. It is possible. But having state drug addicts is not 
an option in a humane society. The government also maintains in 
the plan that there can be no question of legalizing drugs, nor 
does it intend to relax police efforts against drug kingpins or 
people at the street level. But aside from appointing a drug 
committee, transferring methadone treatment to the counties, 
providing additional training for treatment personnel, and 
issuing a number of unfinanced statements of intent that call on 
counties and municipalities to expand treatment programs, the 
report is characterized by a modest level of ambition. There 
are no easy solutions to the problem. But that does not prohibit 
people from thinking more offensively than defensively. More 
action, fewer words, please.
