  [Text] A close aide of Burmese drug warlord Khun Sa 
yesterday denied that the opium kingpin wants his Shan state to 
become part of the Thai kingdom. 
  Khernsai Jaiyene said although Khun Sa respects the Thai 
monarch highly and wants closer ties with Bangkok, he wants Shan 
to remain "independent". 
  He said Khun Sa could have been misquoted. 
  "We respect His Majesty the King and, once Shan state gains 
independence, we would like to invite the Thais to trade with 
us," Khun Sa said during a recent press interview. "All our rich 
natural resources can be sold to Thailand as raw material and 
Thailand will benefit immensely from it." 
  Khun Sa said he would like Shan state to have a close 
economic relationship with Thailand, like that of countries in 
the European Community.
