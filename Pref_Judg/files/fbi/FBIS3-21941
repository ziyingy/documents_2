  [Editorial Report] Seoul SISA JOURNAL reported in its 10 
February issue on pages 20-30 that its own special team of 
reporters had recently made a trip to Southeast Asia's Golden 
Triangle to search for clues of Korean involvement in Khun Sa's 
heroin trade. 
  While visiting the Golden Triangle, the SISA team learned 
that a Korean man has been working for Khun Sa and that Khun 
Sa's international narcotics organization has selected Korea and 
Japan as its "next heroin markets" because heroin supply routes 
to the United States have become increasingly dangerous, while 
Korea and Japan are easily accessible by sea. Korean smugglers 
already use the open seas as smuggling routes to transport gems, 
aged teak roots, tiger skin, bear's gall bladers, etc. from 
Southeast Asia. 
  The Korean Government reportedly has no means of stemming 
the flow of heroin into the country. The SISA team is urging 
the government to shift its attention from philopon (crystal 
methamphetamine) to Khun Sa's heroin.
