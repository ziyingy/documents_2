  [Text] Montevideo, 26 Feb (EFE) -- Favored by a "cheap 
dollar" and low import duties, the Uruguayan public purchased 
during 1993 a record figure of imported cars, food, drinks, 
electric appliances, and clothes. 
  The trend leading Uruguayan companies to purchase imported 
machinery has continued on a constant basis since 1989, and 
increased during 1993. 
  This consumption trend and the preference for foreign 
products have led Uruguay to end 1993 with a $679 million trade 
deficit, a historical record. 
  Exports, which dropped by 3.4 percent, remain stable between 
$1.6 and $1.7 billion dollars. 
  The $679 million trade balance deficit is due to a trade 
opening process combined with a low dollar exchange rate in real 
terms, which stimulates imports. 
  Uruguay last year imported $543 million worth of electric 
machines and appliances; $407 million worth of cars; $1.126 
billion worth of textiles and clothes; and $300 million worth of 
food and drinks. 
  Many of the imported products competed with local products, 
making domestic prices drop. 
  The import of consumer products increased the most (43 
percent) during 1993, but capital goods also increased (13 
percent), especially in machinery and equipment. 
  The unequal evolution of inflation (52.86 percent during 
1993) and the devaluation of the Uruguayan peso in comparison 
with the dollar (26.88 percent during the same year) made 
Uruguayan products less competitive. 
  This situation, which has stagnated Uruguayan exports, has 
generated harsh criticism and claims from Uruguayan exporters. 
  Export volume has remained stable over the last five years, 
but its composition has changed significantly. 
  While traditional exports (beef, leather, wool) constituted 
45 percent of total exports in 1983, they only constituted 26 
percent of total exports in 1993. 
  Textile products and beef exports, despite a drop of 16 and 
19 percent respectively in 1993 in comparison with 1992, 
continue to lead sales abroad. 
  As for the principal imports, they continue to be those 
meant 
for consumption. Imported car sales hit the record figure of 
31,335 in 1993, which is 68 percent more than 1992. Food and 
drink imports increased by 43 percent. 
  Consumer goods imports increased by 315 percent over the 
past 
four years, while capital goods imports increased 144 percent. 
  Brazil became Uruguay's main trade partner in 1993, as 
Brazilian exports to Uruguay increased by 30 percent while 
Uruguayan exports to Brazil increased by 24 percent, thus 
surpassing Argentina which up until now had been Uruguay's main 
trade partner. 
  Imports from the United States dropped by 16 percent in 
1993. 
Imports from the European Union dropped by 20 percent, while 
those from the rest of Europe dropped by 37 percent. Asian 
imports dropped by 11 percent during the same year.
