<F P=106> [Statement issued by Yaovi Agboyibor, Action Committee for </F>
Renewal chairman, in Lome on 17 March; read by CAR Secretary 
General Dodji Apevo] 
  [Text] In a statement broadcast yesterday the Togolese 
Union for Democracy [UTD] announced that the Action Committee 
for Renewal [CAR] has offered the role of National Assembly 
speaker to the Rally of the Togolese People [RPT]. 
  At a meeting held yesterday, the eight opposition political 
parties which took part in the February legislative elections 
deplored the fact that such a statement had been made at a time 
when the democratic forces are closing their ranks. The UTD 
chairman, therefore called on the radio and television officials 
to suspend the rebroadcast of the statement and the CAR agreed 
to withdraw the denial it prepared in reaction to the UTD's 
statement. 
  However, in the national radio's 1900 newscast, the RPT 
mentioned the UTD's statement, so the CAR deems it necessary to 
inform the public that at no moment has it proposed the role of 
National Assembly speaker to the RPT. It is hard to believe 
that the CAR, which is striving to safeguard the cohesion of the 
two political parties to which the people granted the absolute 
majority during the recent legislative elections, would offer 
such a crucial post as that of National Assembly speaker to the 
RPT. 
  The CAR expresses satisfaction with the statement published 
yesterday by the CAR and the UTD reaffirming that the two 
parties constitute the absolute majority within the National 
Assembly and that they intend to work alongside the other 
democratic forces to manage the Togolese people's victory in 
order to bring about the change that is so much desired by the 
Togolese. 
  The CAR strongly reiterates its appeal to the forces of 
change to be extra vigilant to avoid falling victim to the 
divisive maneuvers of the advocates of the past order.
