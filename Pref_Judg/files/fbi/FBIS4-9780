  [Text] The Eastern Army has carried out a tactical naval 
exercise in Camaguey as part of the Revolutionary Navy's 
training with a view to countering enemy action. Maneuvers 
included loading, unloading, launching mines, and accurately 
mapping the bay's minefields, which shows what resources the 
Cuban people's naval units have to counter a possible military 
blockade and the systematic deterioration of the bay. 
  The maneuvers, which involved embarkment, cruising, attack, 
and operations against enemy mines were described as positive, 
as were the organization, discipline, and interest shown by the 
sailors of the outstanding municipality of Nuevitas. Camaguey 
was able to host this meeting as a result of having obtained, 
for seven consecutive years, first place in the emulative 
competition of the Eastern Army's naval command and the zone of 
operations in question. The exercise showed that the people of 
Camaguey are capable of thwarting any enemy action against our 
coasts.
