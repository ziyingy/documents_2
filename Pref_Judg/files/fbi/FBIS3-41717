  [Text] MOSCOW. The health of the Russian population is 
deteriorating, and in 5 years mortality may twice exceed the 
birth rate. Such is the forecast made at a conference of 
directors of RF public health agencies just ending in Moscow. 
The participants of the conference concluded that public health 
services in all regions are in a disastrous state, and they are 
essentially breaking down, while health care is becoming 
increasingly less available to the population. The incidence of 
measles almost quadrupled this year, that of typhoid fever 
increased by a factor of 2.2, and diphtheria is assuming the 
nature of an epidemic: The number of patients is nearing 8,000. 
Two hundred seventy-five persons have died, to include 54 
children.
