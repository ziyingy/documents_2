<F P=106> [Graded Wage System Practiced in Southern Shandong; </F>
Prisoners With Outstanding Contributions Make Over 200 Yuan in 
Monthly Income"] 
  [Text] Jinan, 6 March -- Starting February this year, the 
Lunan 7 May Prison in Shandong Province put into practice a 
graded wage system among its prisons. This is the first time a 
Chinese prison has introduced such a system. 
  With a view to better transforming prisoners and ensuring 
production safety, the Lunan 7 May Prison has decided to try out 
among its prisoners a graded wage system, which consists of 1) a 
basic wage, including 45 yuan as living expenses and 5 yuan as 
pocket money; 2) a graded wage varying from 10 to 35 yuan, with 
a 5- yuan difference at each grade; 3) an incentive wage 
depending on the output of production; 4) various allowances; 
and 5) a frugality award. 
  It has been learned that under the graded wage system, 
prisoners with an outstanding performance in transformation and 
production can earn a monthly income of over 200 yuan. 
  The graded wage system practiced in the 7 May Prison has 
helped stimulate the enthusiasm and consciousness of prisoners 
in remolding themselves, ensure safety in transformation and 
production, enhance the labor and technical qualities of 
prisoners, and put an end to waste.
