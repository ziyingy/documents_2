  [Text] Niigata, March 22 KYODO -- A Russian-registered 
oceanographic survey ship left here Tuesday [22 March] on a 
mission to monitor the effects on the Sea of Japan of 
radioactive waste dumping by a vessel of the Russian Pacific 
Fleet last year, Japanese Government officials said. 
  The dispatch of the 4,162-ton Okean by Japan, Russia and 
South Korea was called for by a conference of scientists held in 
the Russian far east city of Vladivostok last month. 
  The Okean carries nine Japanese Government officials and 27 
scientists from South Korea, Russia and the Vienna-based 
International Atomic Energy Agency. 
  The voyage is the first joint research effort by the three 
countries to study whether the sea is contaminated by 
radioactivity. 
  Seawater and seabed sediment samples will be collected by 
the 
Okean at seven points and measured for radioactivity, the 
officials said. 
  The Russian Navy on October 16 and 17 last year dumped 900 
tons of liquid nuclear waste in the Sea of Japan. A planned 
second dumping was canceled following protests from Japan and 
South Korea.
