  [Text] Sichuan's outspoken governor, Xiao Yang, has 
criticised Beijing's handling of the resettlement of 1 million 
people in the province who will be forced to move because of the 
massive Three Gorges Dam project. 
  Xiao said Beijing's failure to put forward a resettlement 
plan for Sichuan had caused uncertainty among those slated to 
leave. 
  "Objectively speaking, we should admit the people have a 
feeling of leaving home and being utterly in the dark about the 
future," he said. 
  "This is related to the fact that the state has not put 
forward a proposal to handle the 1 million resettlers." 
  Xiao said too much attention was being paid to initiating 
large-scale engineering projects on the 95.4 billion renminbi 
[Rmb] (HK84.7bn) dam, which resettlement could not keep up with. 
  "The resettlement work cannot be carried out in such a big 
way yet. There is a noticeable lack of enthusiasm," he said. 
  He took particular aim at the policy of relying on 
agriculture to provide a living for the resettled people. 
  "If there is only land cultivation, these places will remain 
poor," he said. 
  The controversial dam project is closely associated with the 
Chinese Premier, Li Peng, who pushed it through against stiff 
opposition in 1992. Xiao's forthright statements on the 
problems of the dam project came only weeks after Sichuan's 
vice-governor, Gan Yuping, said some state funds earmarked for 
resettlement had been diverted to other uses, adding fuel to 
widespread suspicions of embezzlement and misuse of the funds by 
companies set up in Beijing to promote development in the dam 
area. 
  Sichuan has been promised Rmb1.3bn from Beijing for 
resettlement work this year out of a total budget over the next 
17 years of Rmb30bn.
