<H5>  A. Overview </H5>
  Japanese society and its economy continue to undergo 
remarkable changes: diversification and sophistication in the 
people's lifestyle and consciousness, changes in regional and 
industrial structures, a society made up of increasingly more 
elderly people, and globalization. In addition, there are calls 
for worldwide cooperation in tackling global environmental 
problems as an issue common to all of humanity. Towards the goal 
of coping with these socio-economic changes and improving the 
standard of living, technological development in the field of 
transportation plays an increasingly important role. 
  During FY93 the Ministry of Transport (MOT) will develop 
railway technology, automotive technology, shipbuilding 
technology, ocean-utilization technology, space-development 
technology, and so forth, and will promote the development of 
technology that covers many fields: improving traffic and 
transportation safety, improving port and harbor construction 
technology, mitigating natural disasters, improving 
disaster-prevention technology, preventing pollution, preserving 
the environment, etc. 
  Table 1 summarizes the MOT-related Special Coordination 
Funds 
for Promoting S&amp;T in the FY93 budget. The subtotal of major 
expenses for research institutes that are under the MOT's 
control increased 3.3&percnt;. As for administrative department 
expenses, transport technology R&amp;D expenses increased 
3.6&percnt;, and 
geostationary meteorological satellite operation expenses 
increased 19.9&percnt;, resulting in a 19.1&percnt; increase in 
the 
subtotal. The overall expenses under MOT jurisdiction increased 
9.8&percnt;, indicating growth that corresponds to the 
importance of 
R&amp;D in the field of transportation. 
  In addition to those expenses, &yen;5.767 billion as 
subsidies for the development of railway technology, such as 
superconductive magnetic levitation train technology, and 
&yen;996 million as subsidies for advanced ship technology 
R&amp;D 
are appropriated in the general account.

<H5>  B. Research at Major Research Institutes </H5>
  Table 2 shows the items implemented as special research in 
FY93, centering on MOT research institutes. This table also 
includes research items based on budgets appropriated in lump 
sums for other ministries and agencies and special accounts. 
Below we will explain those items that warrant special mention, 
centering on new research items. 
<H3>  1. Research on Structural Safety Evaluation To Accommodate 
Lighter-Weight Ships </H3>
  From now on, the demand for larger and faster ships is 
expected to increase, and various types of high-speed ships are 
being developed in Japan and other countries. With that, the 
current safety standards for light-structure ships are being 
revised by the International Maritime Organization (IMO), and 
safety standards for the new high-speed ships are being studied 
in Japan as well. This research involves investigating 
structural safety, which is closely related to the safety of 
high-speed ships. Because the existing design standards are not 
applicable to some parts of the new types of ships, 
necessitating safety evaluation by means of direct calculations, 
the MOT will investigate weight-setting methods, structural 
analysis methods, and strength evaluation methods for that; 
clarify the necessary and sufficient conditions for ensuring 
safety; and study methods of safety inspections based on actual 
ship measurements. 
<H3>  2. Research on Aircraft Monitoring Methods for Shorter 
Vertical Control Intervals </H3>
  With the increase in the volume of air traffic, it is 
expected that altitudes of 29,000 ft and higher 1,000-ft 
vertical intervals will have to be adopted in order to 
effectively use air space. With that there has arisen a need for 
setting up a system that monitors, detects, and excludes 
aircraft whose altitude maintenance error exceeds a certain 
value. This effort involves researching the feasibility, 
configuration, etc., of a monitoring system for the purpose of 
establishing technology for monitoring aircraft altitude 
maintenance error. 
<H3>  3. Research on Advanced Earthquake-Resistant Design Methods 
for Seaside Facilities To Withstand Strong Earthquakes Directly 
Beneath Tokyo </H3>
  Recently, the increasing probability of a powerful 
earthquake 
occurring directly beneath Tokyo has been indicated, and the 
investigation of how Tokyo's seaside facilities will hold up in 
such a scenario has become an urgent issue. Accordingly, the MOT 
will conduct research to infer earthquake engineering 
characteristics, the dynamic behavior of structures and 
foundations that would result from such an earthquake, the 
amount of structural deformation in such a disaster, etc., in 
order to improve the level of earthquake-resistant design 
methods for seaside facilities. 
<H3>  4. Research on Technology for Evaluating the Safety of 
Advanced Urban Railway Transit Systems </H3>
  The introduction of "advanced transit systems" that use new 
technology in urban rail lines is thought to be very effective 
in solving problems such as congestion during commuting hours 
and the longer amounts of time people spend on trains. However, 
there have been hardly any technical evaluations of these 
advanced transit systems, and there has been little progress in 
making those systems practical. Therefore, safety evaluation 
technology must be improved so that it can handle the new 
technology and thereby facilitate the introduction of these 
transit systems. This research involves investigating technology 
for evaluating transit safety, brake performance, and train 
operation security systems, and gathering data on the safety of 
advanced transit systems. 
<H3>  5. Research on Advanced Technology for Predicting Global 
Warming </H3>
  Owing to the increase in atmospheric CO&lt;inf&gt; 2&lt;/inf&gt;  caused 
by fossil fuel consumption, global-scale warming has become an 
international issue; warming prediction, socio-economic affects, 
and measures for coping with global warming are being 
investigated in the IPCC. Because there will be an abundance of 
observational data in the late 1990s from programs such as TOGA 
and WOCE, this research involves developing technology for 
comprehensively analyzing that data, maintaining grid-point 
climate data, and developing atmospheric-ocean-coupled models of 
the entire globe. 
<H3>  6. Research on Methods of Platform Testing ABS-Equipped 
Large Vehicles </H3>
  Although regulations mandating ABS (anti-lock brake system) 
installation in combination vehicles and large buses are 
enforced, tests of ABS performance during usage have not been 
implemented, and only the electronic control sections of ABS 
systems are inspected. With the increase in ABS-equipped 
vehicles from now on, mandating periodic inspections 
necessitates the development of platform testing devices with 
which performance tests equivalent to road tests can be 
reproduced for the purpose of confirming the state of ABS 
operation during braking and the resulting safety. This research 
involves investigating the performance requirements for platform 
testing devices, formulating the specifications of and 
trial-producing a device, and obtaining materials on testing 
methods. 
<H5>  7. Research on the Application of NO </H5>
&lt;inf&gt; x&lt;/inf&gt; -Reduction 
Technology to Medium-Weight Gasoline Tank Trucks (Expenses for 
National Laboratories' Test Research on Pollution Prevention, 
etc.) 
  Countermeasures against diesel exhaust are urgently needed 
because environmental levels of NO&lt;inf&gt; 2&lt;/inf&gt;  are not achieved 
near major urban roadways and floating particulates cause health 
problems. Such measures, however, are technologically difficult. 
If the kind of technology used in passenger cars for dealing 
with exhaust gas can be applied to medium-weight gasoline tank 
trucks, that would be an effective way to prevent air pollution 
in the future. This research effort involves studying ideal 
NO&lt;inf&gt; x&lt;/inf&gt; -reduction technology that can be applied in 
medium-weight gasoline tank trucks (catalytic converter rhodium, 
etc.), measures for improving the durability of catalysts, and 
other such technology for practical use. 
<H3>  8. Research on Advanced Methods of Identifying Trace Amounts 
of Lubricating Oil (Expenses for National Laboratories' Test 
Research on Pollution Prevention, etc.) </H3>
  After fuel oil, the most prevalent leakage from bilges into 
the ocean is generally a mixture of fuel oil and lubricating 
oil. As time passes, the low-boiling-point components evaporate 
and mostly lubricating oil remains, but, with analysis methods 
up until now, identifying lubricating oil had been difficult. In 
recent years, however, the functions of analysis equipment have 
improved, and the analysis of high-boiling-point components in 
lubricating oil has become possible. This research involves 
investigating methods of analyzing those components, then 
combining those with existing methods to establish a way to 
identify bilges and lubricating oil with a high degree of 
accuracy. 
<H3>  9. Research on Technology for Utilizing Human Perception and 
Sensory Functions in Nuclear Power Plant Operation (Expenses for 
Nuclear Power Test Research at National Laboratories) </H3>
  In the operation of nuclear power plants and other such 
large-scale systems, conveying plant information to the 
operators through physical models is effective, but the manner 
in which the information is conveyed to operators must be 
compatible with human perception and sensory functions. For that 
reason, providing information that is selected with 
consideration for human capabilities and characteristics is 
important. In this effort researchers will investigate ways to 
convey information so that whatever is currently happening in a 
plant can be recognized with the five human senses, the purpose 
of which is to accurately convey automated, black-box plant 
information; operational methods based on the information that 
is conveyed; and ways for operators to be able to sense the 
effects of operations on the plant. 
<H3>  10. Basic Research on Foundation Measures for Nuclear Power 
Facilities in Coastal Regions (Expenses for Nuclear Power Test 
Research at National Laboratories) </H3>
  Because harbors are important as transportation nodes, basic 
research must be accumulated in connection with radioactive 
substance transport measures, nuclear power facilities in 
coastal regions, and evaluation of the safety of those.

&lt;sup&gt; *&lt;/sup&gt;  Indicates new research that starts in FY93. This table does not 
include research based on Expenses for the Promotion of S&amp;T and Expenses for 
Promotion of Global Environmental Research. 


<H5>  C. Transport Technology R&amp;D Expenses </H5>
  These are R&amp;D survey expenses that have been 
appropriated 
since FY82 for facilitating cooperation between the government 
and private sector in the R&amp;D of transport technology that 
relates to many fields. Table 3 shows the research that MOT will 
conduct in FY93. 
  One such effort, "research studies on the development of 
transport-related multipurpose satellite systems," involves the 
development of repeaters for search-and-rescue communications 
(SAR) demonstration experiments. 
  "Research studies on establishing comprehensive safety 
measures to cope with the changes in traffic environments in 
recent years" involves the development of technology pertaining 
to harbor facilities that will accommodate the safe navigation 
of super-high-speed ships during the night and in congested 
areas, the objective of which is to shift the demand away from 
road transportation, where worsening traffic environments are 
becoming a social problem, to marine transport. 
  The objective of "development of on-rail trailers for 
low-pollution goods distribution" is to develop an on-rail 
trailer system that is suitable for faster combination vehicles, 
improved conveyance technology, smaller yard work space, and 
labor saving in order to facilitate converting the transport 
mode from trucks to railway in mid- and long-distance freight 
transport. 
  "Research on public transport technology for the elderly and 
disabled" involves R&amp;D of bus systems suitable for use by 
elderly and physically handicapped people, terminal guidance 
systems for visually impaired people, etc., because reducing the 
physical burden involved and improving safety are essential for 
the use of public transport by elderly and handicapped people.

<H5>  D. Geostationary Meteorological Satellite Operation </H5>
  There are plans to launch the next-term geostationary 
meteorological satellite (GMS-5) in FY94, the objectives of 
which are to continue satellite-based meteorological 
observations, to improve technology relating to meteorological 
satellites, and so forth. As the development expenses for that, 
&yen;4.519 billion are appropriated in FY93. 
<H5>  E. Summary of Global-Environmental-Related Budget </H5>
  The MOT has been tackling global-scale environmental 
problems 
since long ago. Continually working in cooperation with 
concerned international organizations, the ministry brings about 
numerous results in areas such as those related to global 
warming, destruction of the ozone layer, marine pollution, etc. 
  With a budget of about &yen;8.800 billion in FY93, the MOT 
will continue to actively wrestle with global-scale 
environmental problems: it will strive to strengthen 
observation, monitoring, and forecasting systems; elucidate the 
mechanisms of environmental changes and assess those effects; 
and so forth. Table 4 shows the main items in that budget.
