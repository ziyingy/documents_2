  [Text] A dramatic increase in rabies cases last year is 
causing concern at the National Veterinary Service, which 
reported 70 cases in 1993, the highest number since 1957. There 
were only 46 reported cases in 1992. 
  "The increase -- which is very worrying -- is because of the 
rising incidents among foxes and jackals," said Chief 
Veterinarian Avner Shimshoni. "It shows that without efforts to 
reduce the jackal and fox population there is no way of stopping 
the spread of rabies." 
  Just 15 of the reported rabies cases last year were in dogs; 
43 were among foxes and jackals and the rest in other animals 
including one sheep, an ass, a cat, and cattle. In 1992, 23 
rabies cases were dogs and 13 were foxes and jackals. 
  During 1993, 117,129 dogs were vaccinated against rabies -- 
an increase of 10 percent over the previous year -- but a 
quarter of the dog population remains without anti-rabies 
inoculation, Shimshoni noted. 
  The rise in the numbers of dog owners vaccinating their pets 
is partly a response to the drop in license and vaccine fees in 
some towns. New regulations in force at the end of 1993 put a 
maximum price dog license at NIS [new Israeli shekels] 37.5 and 
NIS 13.5 for the vaccine.
