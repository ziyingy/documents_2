  [Text] Seoul, Feb. 21 (YONHAP) -- Exports of South 
Korean-made weapons totaled 75 million U.S. dollars last year, 
the first upturn of weapons exports since the mid-1980s. 
  A Defense Ministry material showed on Monday that the 1993 
exports compare with mere 25 million dollars in weapons exports 
in the previous year. 
  Exports of weapons had been very sluggish from the close of 
the 1970s before they turned brisk last year thanks to heavy 
shipment to some Southeast Asian countries, according to the 
material.
