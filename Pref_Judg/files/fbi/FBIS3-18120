  [Text] Hamburg (DDP/ADN) -- The smuggling and illegal trade 
involving nuclear materials in Germany has risen sharply. 
  Quoting a confidential report by the German Interior 
Ministry, BILD AM SONNTAG reports that the number of attempts to 
make money from the illegal sale of nuclear materials rose to 
123 in 1993. In the previous year only 99 cases had been 
recorded. 
  Last year police made 545 arrests in connection with nuclear 
smuggling. The majority of the perpetrators came from Russia or 
the Czech Republic. In two cases, criminals attempted to 
extract millions [currency not given] by threatening to cause a 
nuclear explosion. However, the investigations showed that both 
cases were bluffs. The report says the total number of offenses 
involving radioactive materials in 1993 was 240.
