  [Text] Bonn, April 4 (XINHUA) -- The Paris Committee 
(COCOM), founded 45 years ago to control Western exports to 
communist countries, has disbanded itself as from April 1 and 
will be replaced by a new organization this fall. 
  Local press reported that the decision was made at a recent 
meeting of the 17 member states of the committee, commonly known 
as the Paris Club. The committee included Japan, Australia and 
all NATO member countries except Iceland. 
  The Paris-based committee, which was also called 
Consultative 
Group Cooperation Committee, was the product of the Cold War and 
designed to control the East-West trade, especially export of 
"strategic" materials to communist nations. 
  Local reports said that the former COCOM member states will 
still maintain restrictions on their exports to Libya, Syria, 
Iran, Iraq, Cuba and the Democratic People's Republic of Korea.
