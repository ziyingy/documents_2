  [Text] Millions of people may be breathing hazardous levels 
of pollution because government information bulletins conceal 
the truth. 
  Concentrations of ozone, a gas produced by car and 
industrial 
fumes, routinely break World Health Organisation guidelines, a 
study of environment department data discloses. 
  The department, which issues air quality warnings on a 
telephone service, said ozone levels broke health limits on 23 
days last year. The true figure was more than 230 days, 
according to a study by Friends of the Earth. 
  Natural ozone at high altitudes protects the Earth from 
damaging ultraviolet light, but at lower levels the gas is being 
linked to an increase in asthma cases, lung damage, eye 
irritation and smog. Studies in America indicate that up to 10 
per cent of healthy adults could be ozone sensitive, 
experiencing tight chests and nose, eye and throat irritation. 
  In cities, ozone pollution is aggravated by other exhaust 
fumes, including nitrogen dioxide and sooty particles, 
scientists claim. High ozone concentrations occur on still, 
sunny days through a reaction between carbon monoxide, 
hydrocarbons and nitrogen oxide. The effects can be felt 
hundreds of miles downwind of busy cities. 
  The environment department claimed that there were no days 
in 
Stevenage last year when ozone air quality was poor. But an 
analysis of the official data shows that ozone levels in the 
Hertfordshire town broke WHO guidelines on 13 days. 
  A similar pattern emerges across the country from many of 
the 
21 stations monitoring ozone pollution. In Birmingham city 
centre, levels broke health guidelines three times, yet no 
official warnings were given. At two sites in London -- 
Bloomsbury and Victoria -- there were potentially hazardous 
ozone levels on two occasions, but officially there was a clean 
bill of health. 
  Fiona Weir, senior air pollution campaigner at Friends of 
the 
Earth, accused the government of massaging the figures. Air 
quality bulletins are issued only when ozone levels peak at 90 
parts per billion for more than an hour. Until May 1992, the 
figure was 100 parts per billion. Both limits are at the upper 
end of the WHO's one-hour guideline, whose lower limit is 76 
parts per billion. 
  The WHO also sets limits for ozone levels of 50-60 parts per 
billion over an eight-hour exposure period. Ms Weir said that 
the government had ignored this, despite a European Community 
directive which recognises that the eight-hour exposure limit is 
a health risk. 
  Some scientists and environmentalists are also concerned 
that 
Britain has two few monitoring stations.
