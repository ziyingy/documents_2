  [Text] Tokyo, May 11 KYODO -- The government decided 
Wednesday to dismantle a decades-old law requiring exports to be 
inspected for quality control as part of the government's 
deregulation policy, officials said. 
  The decision by the Ministry of International Trade and 
Industry to abolish the export inspection law follows approval 
earlier in the day by the Export Inspection and Design Promotion 
Council, an advisory panel to the minister, ministry officials 
said. 
  They said the abolishment of the law will be incorporated in 
a package of deregulation measures to be announced by the 
government by the end of next month. 
  The law was enacted in 1957 with the aim of improving the 
quality of exports and thereby promoting exports. Under the 
legislation, designated goods are required to pass export 
inspections before being shipped abroad.
