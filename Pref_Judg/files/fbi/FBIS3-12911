<F P=106> [Interview with PLO Executive Committee Chairman Yasir </F>
'Arafat, in Tunis, by David Frost, in the studio on 6 
March--recorded; from the "Frost on Sunday" program] 
  [Text] [Frost] Do you blame the Israeli military for taking 
part in the massacre in Hebron? 
  ['Arafat] It was clear [words indistinct] that this massacre 
cannot be done without the help and the cover of some Israeli 
units, who according to everybody information and it is known 
for everybody that the mosque in Hebron is completely under the 
protection and the supervision of the Israeli Army units and all 
its gates and around it, no, and I have the right to ask how 
this gang had the ability to enter this mosque with these 
armorments and in the same time these units open their fire 
against these people who were escaping from the mosque from 
outside and some of them -- about eight have been killed and 24 
have been injured in front of the mosque. 
  [Frost] But Mr. Chairman I know how much you believe in 
peace 
of the brave, you cannot let, you musn't let surely one madman, 
one madman end these talks? 
  ['Arafat] There were not one, but between 10 and 12, and for 
your information the persons who were being killed inside the 
mosque and being injured, about 322 some of them had received 
more than seven bullets. 
  [Frost] What is the next move Mr. Chairman if talks are to 
start again? 
  ['Arafat] We have to wait and see what is going in the 
Security Council and we are waiting for a stronger resolution, 
we are in need of a quick move from the [word indistinct] 
especially from the Clinton Administration. 
  [Frost] Have you spoken to President Clinton since the 
massacre? 
  ['Arafat] I haven't had the ability to speak [word 
indistinct] but have had the opportunity to [talk with] Mr. 
Christopher. 
  [Frost] And what did he say to you? 
  ['Arafat] He promised me that he would do all his best in 
the 
Security Council to have a stronger resolution. 
  [Frost] How many military observers to you think you need to 
see in the West Bank and in Gaza? 
  ['Arafat] I am not asking for the moon, I am asking for 
something suitable and convenient. 
  [Frost] Do you feel that what this massacre did was also to 
increase the support for the extreme Hamas [Islamic Resistance 
Movement] movement and make life more difficult for the PLO? 
  ['Arafat] They have the right to ask me -- not only Hamas -- 
everybody has the right to ask me, this is the peace [words 
indistinct] and I have the right ask the [word indistinct] and 
especially President Clinton is this the peace which I have 
signed in Washington? 
  [Frost] When do you think those peace talks will start 
again? 
  ['Arafat] You can't go to the tango, and dance the tango 
alone, you have to ask the other sides who are still maneuvering 
to try to avoid the accurate and honest implementation of what 
had been signed and agreed upon. 
  [Frost] If Israel is ready to tango as well, the Americans 
will provide the music in Washington. 
  ['Arafat] The music in Washington, but first of all is there 
a will? if there is no will there is no way, if there is a will 
there is a way, otherwise all of us will lose, not me 
personally, not me as a Palestinian people, because peace is not 
only a Palestinian need, it's a Palestinian need, Israeli need, 
Arab need, inter-Arabian need, American need, international need. 
  [Frost] But I mean in our conversation at Christmas, just 
before in December you said when I asked you if you trust Prime 
Minister Rabin and you said yes, do you still trust him, do you? 
  ['Arafat] I am sorry to say I will have to wait and see how 
after this delay of this implementation of what is [word 
indistinct] upon I have to wait and see, it seems that he is 
following the advice of this extremist Israeli Army. 
  [Frost] So when do you expect to be sitting in your office 
in 
Jericho? 
  ['Arafat] Sorry, in the past I was imagining that the other 
side was going to implement accurately and honestly what was 
agreed upon. Now I am sorry to say I cannot give you the answer 
for this question, sorry to say. 
  [Frost] Is the PLO weaker as a result of this massacre? 
  ['Arafat] The moment is not the PLO all the people [word 
indistinct] have lost its credibility, not only before the 
massacre but after the massacre, it became clear and obvious, 
that this process had lost its credibility completely. 
  [Frost] Well this is a major, a major change from the 
optimistic Yasir 'Arafat of ten days ago. 
  ['Arafat] I am a pragmatic man, I am not dealing with 
dreams, 
I am dealing with realities and fact. 
  [Frost] Mr. Chairman, thank you very much. 
  ['Arafat] Thank you.
