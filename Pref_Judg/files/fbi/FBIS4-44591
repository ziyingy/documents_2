Discovers 10 Million-Ton Grade Oil Field"] 
  [Text] The Jiangsu Petroleum Exploration Bureau discovered 
an oil field with 10 million tons of reserves on 25 March 1994, 
the Cuizhuang oil field. 
  This oil field is located in the Jinhu depression area of 
northern Jiangsu. This is the second large oil field the Jiangsu 
Petroleum Exploration Bureau has found in the 19 years since it 
was established, following the discovery of Zhenwu oil field. 
  The Jiangsu Petroleum Exploration Bureau began exploring the 
Cuizhuang region in 1976. In 1993, after completing a 
development economics assessment of this oil region and 
discussing a development program, the bureau transferred and 
concentrated its forces to undertake development battle work. It 
has been projected that a yearly production capacity of 100,000 
tons of crude oil may be formed by October 1994. 
  The discovery of Cuizhuang oil field once again illustrates 
the great prospects for oil and gas exploration in Jiangsu. 
After this oil field is completed and placed into production, 
the Jiangsu Petroleum Exploration Bureau's annual petroleum 
production capacity will surpass 1 million tons. This will play 
an important role in alleviating the Jiangsu region's energy 
shortages and spurring the development of Jiangsu's economy, 
especially the northern Jiangsu region.
