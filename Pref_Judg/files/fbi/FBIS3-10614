  [Text] The Democratic Revolutionary Party [PRD] has 
apologized to the Christian Democratic Party [PDC] for the 
incidents of aggression against the latter in La Chorrera. The 
PRD leaders said they will submit to the investigations by the 
Justice and Peace Commission, and, if the accusations turn out 
to be true, they are going to take the appropriate measures. 
The PDC members directly accuse Mr. Harmodio Estribi of being 
the promoter of these aggressions. Mitchell Doens, secretary 
general of the PRD, said that in his talks with Estribi, he 
concludes there were in fact attacks on the PDC in La Chorrera 
but not to the extent denounced by the PDC. 
  [Begin recording] [Doens] Estribi publicly asked the PDC for 
explanations of the incidents that took place. He asked for 
explanations of the flag incidents. Certain flags were grabbed 
and the like. We have instructed him to talk to the PDC leaders 
in La Chorrera to clear up these incidents and prevent them from 
reoccurring in the future. Those are the instructions we gave 
companero Harmodio Estribi. 
  [Unidentified reporter] So an incident did in fact occur. 
  [Doens] There was an incident, there was some pushing and 
shoving when the motorcade went by. The people who were present 
shouted a few things at each other, and as a result flags were 
suddenly grabbed. I insist that the incidents are being 
exaggerated to the point that some published media seem to be in 
collusion to do this. [end recording]
