  [Text] St. Petersburg May 27 TASS -- Special titanic 
[Moscow Radio Rossii Network in Russian at 0900 GMT on 27 May 
1994 describes the "titanic" plugs as "titanium"] plugs from St. 
Petersburg will be used to prevent the leak of plutonium from 
the nuclear torpedo warheads aboard the sunken Russian submarine 
"Komsomolets." They should seal the openings in the fore part 
of the submarine, which is resting at the depth of 1700 meters. 
  The devices have rubber compacters which should, according 
to 
those who worked on the project, reduce the circulation of water 
currents in the shattered hull of the boat. That, in turn, will 
put a brake on the destruction of the torpedo shells. As a 
result, the likelihood that products of corrosion will wash away 
the plutonium and pollute the underwater ecological system with 
radioactive toxic waste will be decreased. 
  The first titanic "plugs" have already been taken on board 
the research ship "Academic Mstislav Keldysh." The ship is 
supposed to quit the St. Petersburg harbor in about a month and 
set course for the burial site of the atomic submarine. 
  ITAR-TASS was told by Igor Spasskiy, head of the Central 
Naval Technology Design Bureau, that the devices will be 
installed in the "Komsomolets" with the help of the "Mir" 
underwater manned apparatuses, which are equipped with external 
manipulators. 
  The scientists also plan to carry out detailed radiation 
monitoring. The hydrological station which has been near the 
submarine for the past year will be hoisted on board the 
research ship. There the scientists will analyze the station's 
information about hydrodynamic processes and the speed and 
direction of ocean currents in an effort to get a good picture 
of the real condition of the sunken submarine.
