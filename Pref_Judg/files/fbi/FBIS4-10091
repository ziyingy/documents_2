  [Text] Deputy Prosecutor General Francisco Jose Sintura a 
few minutes ago commented on the U.S. State Department report 
criticizing the Colombian judicial system and the policy of the 
Prosecutor General's Office regarding the surrender of drug 
traffickers. 
  [Begin recording] [Unidentified reporter] Mr. Sintura, has 
the prosecutor general capitulated in favor of drug traffickers 
in Colombia? 
  [Sintura] That is not true. A communique that we released 
clearly presents the Prosecutor General's Office position, which 
is this: As long as the existing law forbids drug trafficking 
in every stage, the Office will continue to fight drug 
traffickers and charge them in courts of law. 
  [Reporter] Does the United States have the moral authority 
to 
censure us like this? 
  [Sintura] Well, these are comments that one sovereign state 
makes to another. We have said a few things that we think are 
important, particularly because we understand that the 
generalizations made about the Colombian judicial system can be 
based on either incorrect interpretations of our legal system or 
insufficient reports. [end recording]
