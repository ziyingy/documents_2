  [Text] Washington, February 6 (XINHUA) -- The United States 
has agreed to sell Argentina 36 warplanes with advanced radar 
technology in an effort to rearm the country's air force, it was 
reported here today. 
  The warplanes, built by the U.S. McDonnell Douglas 
Corporation, are called A4M Skyhawk jet attack planes, according 
to the NEW YORK TIMES. 
  The plane is regarded as a very effective in a dogfight 
because it has a small turning radius. 
  But State Department officials said the subsonic Skyhawks 
would be no match for the supersonic British Tornados stationed 
on the Falkland Islands and thus pose no threat to the security 
of the islands. 
  Of most importance to the United States was that the sale of 
the planes would help preserve the balance of power in the 
southern part of Latin America, the newspaper said. 
  The U.S. officials said that with the sale of the Skyhawks, 
Argentina, Brazil and Chile would have roughly equal air 
strength.
