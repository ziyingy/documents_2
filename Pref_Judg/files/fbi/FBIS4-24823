  [Text] Beijing, June 1 (XINHUA) -- China has vowed to 
strengthen the protection and control of the country's forest 
resources, according to a circular issued by the State Council 
recently. 
  According to the circular, the country's timber consumption 
climbed, and the cut in some localities was on the rise. 
  In response, the circular urged governments at all levels 
and 
relevant departments to pay special attention to the protection 
and management of forest resources, saying that the limit on 
timber cuts and transport licensing system should be enforced 
strictly. 
  Also, and the management of forest area use and the 
protection of wildlife and rare plants should be considered an 
important duty of local authorities, said the circular, noting 
that those caught destroying the forest will be punished 
severely.
