  [Text] Kuwait City, March 27 (XINHUA) -- Kuwaiti Petroleum 
Minister 'Ali al-Baghli will pay a visit to China in mid-May, 
XINHUA learned here today. 
  Well-informed sources here told XINHUA that Al-Baghli's tour 
of China will be made at the invitation of Wang Tao, manager 
general (minister level) of the China National Petroleum 
Corporation. 
  During the visit, Al-Baghli will discuss with Chinese 
officials the two countries' cooperation in the oil and gas 
fields. 
  Earlier, the Kuwaiti Arabic newspaper "AL-WATAN" said that 
Kuwait wants to enhance its oil-related cooperation with China. 
  The daily quoted a high-ranking official in Kuwait Petroleum 
Company as saying that his company is seeking to sign with China 
long-term contracts to supply it with crude oil and other 
petroleum outputs. 
  The daily said Kuwait had already supplied China with some 
oil, but the two countries had not yet signed long-term 
contracts. 
  While meeting the new Chinese ambassador to Kuwait earlier 
this year, Kuwaiti Crown Prince and Prime Minister Sa'ad 
al-'Abdallah al- Sabah called on China to enhance bilateral 
cooperation in the economic field, especially in the oil and 
petrochemical field.
