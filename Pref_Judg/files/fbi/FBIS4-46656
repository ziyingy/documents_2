  [Abstract] New methodological possibilities are described 
for using satellites to ascertain the glow characteristics of 
auroras and the electrodynamic characteristics of the polar 
ionosphere which are afforded by an on-board imaging system when 
using the new "Monochromatic Eye" objective; two annotated 
optical diagrams of this objective (for the visible and vacuum 
UV spectral ranges) accompany the text and serve as a basis for 
the detailed textual description. One of the variants for 
constructing a system of wide-angle quasimonochromatic imaging 
cameras for a low-apogee satellite of the "Meteor-3M" type is 
analyzed and the different advantages which it affords for 
studying processes in the polar ionosphere are considered. 
Another diagram shows the geometry of spectrophotometric 
measurements of auroral characteristics from a satellite when 
using wide-angle monochromatic imaging cameras, fully explained 
in the text. The aeronomic characteristics of the upper 
atmosphere are determined more precisely when using these 
satellite- borne instruments. The possibilities of satellite 
registry of the influence of seismic effects on the glow of 
atmospheric emissions are examined. Such observations would be 
invaluable in active coordinated experiments. The premises for 
further development of an imaging system for studying the 
atmospheres and ionospheres of other planets from space 
vehicles, as well as for surface panoramic photometric 
observations of auroras, are discussed. A series of tables gives 
all pertinent technical specifications. Figures 3; references
