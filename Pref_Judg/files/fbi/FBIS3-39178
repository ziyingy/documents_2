correspondent Jarrko Juselius; place and date not given --

  [Text] In Finland's opinion, threatening the Serbs 
besieging Sarajevo with air strikes is justified in order to 
prevent genocide. However, it is more difficult to decide on 
actual air strikes, says Foreign Minister Heikki Haavisto. 
  [Haavisto] In my opinion, the genocide that has been taking 
place around Sarajevo ought to be brought to an end somehow, and 
if this threat is able to end this genocide and as I have 
understood, at least the Serbs are saying that they will then 
move their heavy weapons from the surroundings of the city, then 
that aim has been achieved. 
  [Juselius] In other words, Finland supports in principle 
this 
kind of policy? 
  [Haavisto] Well, in my opinion there must at least be a 
threat of this kind because the European states must have some 
possibility of preventing genocide of this kind. 
  [Juselius] So you are in practice supporting this threat? 
  [Haavisto] I think the threat is justified, but an actual 
strike is considerably harder in practice because there are, 
after all, these UN troops and people doing humanitarian work 
there so it is far more difficult. 
  [Juselius] So Finland will have to formulate its stance 
again 
in the event that arms are actually resorted to? 
  [Haavisto] We will have to see what happens, but I already 
noted that this threat seems to be quite sufficient.
