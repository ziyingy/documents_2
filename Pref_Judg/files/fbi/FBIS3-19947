  [Text] Paris, March 24 (AFP) -- Britain and Argentina 
clashed over the disputed Falkland Islands in a parliamentary 
forum here Thursday [24 March], with the Argentinian Senate 
leader calling on Britain to resume negotiations on sovereignty. 
  "This claim aims at putting an end to the anachronistic 
colonial situation upheld by Great Britain on a portion of 
Argentinian territory, in an open violation of the fundamental 
principles of international law," Eduardo Menem told the 
Interparliamentary Union [IPU]. 
  "The unilateral decisions made by the United Kingdom as 
regards oil in the Malvinas Islands (the Argentinian name for 
the disputed islands) and the extension of its alleged 
jurisdiction around South Georgia and South Sandwich Islands, 
prove the British lack of disposition to start effective 
negotiations with Argentina," said Menem, brother of Argentinian 
President Carlos Menem. 
  But Lord David Montgomery criticised Menem for raising the 
issue, saying "bilateral mechanisms are already in place to 
continue discussions on all subjects. Mr Menem's statement 
seems to ignore the rights of the Falkland Islanders in the 
matter of self-determination," he added. 
  The two countries fought a brief war over the islands in 
1992.
