  [Text] It is planned to set up an international space 
research center in Tajikistan. Our correspondent Raisa 
Mukhiddinova with the details: 
  Mukhiddinova: The Tajik Government has passed the 
decision to set up an international space research center at the 
Presidium of the Academy of Sciences of Tajikistan. 
Imombabadzhanov [name as heard], candidate of 
physics-mathematical sciences, is appointed to administer it. 
Twenty years ago in the East Pamirs, he set up a small x-ray 
emission station, which in time was turned into one of the 
largest in the world. The scientist said that in the summer of 
1993 the world's scientific public was alarmed with reports that 
the x-ray emission station in the Pamirs was threatened with 
closure. Many famous scientists started writing to the 
government and Academy of Sciences of the republic on the need 
to preserve and restore this installation, so unique in the 
world. 
  To understand their alarm, one must go into the history of 
the question a little. Everyone now knows that when studying 
the world of elementary particles, scientists came up against 
many mysterious and complex phenomena, which were impossible to 
reproduce using the most expensive modern accelerators. But 
interest in the interaction of particles accompanied by super 
high energies increased and it was necessary to find new 
possibilities for studying the processes taking place. The idea 
arose of using a natural accelerator, in particular cosmic rays 
or flows of particles with super high energies, which the 
universe continually sends to earth. These particles are caught 
by various pieces of equipment, but the most economical and 
effective method is fixing them onto a film using an x-ray 
emission camera. Such a camera, the biggest in the world, was 
created in the Pamirs.
