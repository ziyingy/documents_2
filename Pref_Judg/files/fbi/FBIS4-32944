  [Text] On 31 May, the Ministry of Finance and Prices made 
the following announcement: Bearing in mind that there are 
gasoline ration coupons in the hands of private consumers that 
were not included in the sale cycle and price increase 
established by the 20 May accord of the Executive Committee of 
the Council of Ministers, it has been decided that during June, 
those coupons will retain the same price and sale cycle as 
before the aforementioned accord. 
  We would also like to remind our listeners that as of 1 
June, 
new prices for cigarettes, cigars, rum, and beer will become 
effective as part of the measures aimed at correcting the 
national financial imbalance. As the year progresses, other 
products and services such as electricity, transportation, 
water, sewage, and postal services will experience price 
increases.
