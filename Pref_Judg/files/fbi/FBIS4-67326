the Event of an SPD Win"] 
  [Text] Berlin -- Johannes Singer, the SPD [Social 
Democratic Party of Germany] Bundestag Group's spokesman on drug 
issues, has welcomed the go-ahead to allow hard drugs in small 
quantities of up to 0.5 grams in North Rhine-Westphalia. He 
told DIE WELT that in the event of an SPD election win, an SPD 
government would pursue a similar drugs policy to that of 
Duesseldorf Justice Minister Rolf Krumsiek (SPD). "After the 16 
October elections, there will certainly be a careful 
liberalization of drugs policy in keeping with the guidelines 
from North-Rhine-Westphalia," said Krumsiek. Krumsiek does not 
think the release of smaller quantities of hard drugs will 
encourage people to try them for the first time in their lives. 
"There will not be a single consumer more," he believes. 
Nevertheless, he has spoken out "vehemently" against the 
complete availability or legalization of hard drugs. "The fight 
against the dealers must be stepped up," he says. 
  However, Duesseldorf's drugs policy is controversial within 
the SPD. Saarland Interior Minister Frieder Laepple has 
criticized the initiative as "the wrong path," and Hans 
Gottfried Bernrath, chairman of the Bundestag Internal Affairs 
Committee, has described it as "risky." 
  Krumsiek has been sharply criticised by the Union and the 
FDP 
[Free Democratic Party] grass roots. According to the business 
manager of the Union Bundestag Group, Juergen Ruettger, the very 
state is turning itself into a drug dealer with policies like 
this. "If the disastrous drugs policy of the Johannes Rau 
(SPD)-led land government exerts itself, all the barriers will 
be broken," he said. 
  Christian Socialist Union land group chief Michael Gros 
called on Johannes Rau to stop the justice minister's 
"dare-devil drugs escapade" immediately. He said the minister's 
decision was irresponsible, and meant submission to the drugs 
mafia. Horst Eylmann (Christian Democratic Union), chairman of 
the Bundestag Legal Committee, accused the North 
Rhine-Westphalian Government of sanctioning the use of hard 
drugs "through the back door." FDP deputy Joerg von Essen said 
the North Rhine-Westphalian decision was not dependent either on 
the law or on any Constitutional Court ruling. 
  The Constitutional Court has not explicitly permitted the 
consumption of smaller quantities of soft drugs like hashish and 
marijuana. It has merely instructed the state prosecution to 
quash cases involving such consumption.
