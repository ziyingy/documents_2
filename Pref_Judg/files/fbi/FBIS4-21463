<F P=106> [Unattributed report: ``Ministry of Environmental </F>
Protection and Natural Resources Against Hungarian Waste''] 
  [Text] The Russian Federation Ministry of Environmental 
Protection and Natural Resources categorically objects against 
burying glass-enclosed radioactive waste from Hungary on the 
territory of Russia. The opinion of the ministry as well as the 
stance of the Russian Federal Committee for Oversight of Nuclear 
and Radiation Safety and the Russian Federation Foreign Ministry 
had not been taken into account, despite official reports, at 
the time a draft protocol on this matter was agreed. 
  The Ministry of Environmental Protection and Natural 
Resources will be insisting on an immediate correction of the 
document because the protocol directly violates the law ``On the 
Protection of the Natural Environment.''
