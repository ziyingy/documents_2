  [Abstract] Conceptual aspects of the Global Climate 
Observing System, approved by the Eleventh Congress of the World 
Meteorological Organization, are analyzed. Opinions are 
expressed on the need for better substantiation of priorities in 
reserach on global climate change. The author quarrels with the 
subjects assigned to the working groups, as they do not reflect 
top prioirty problems and questions which should be addressed. 
The author believes that conventional and space observation 
facilities have not been combined in a way that achieves 
optimum effectiveness. It is pointed out that the list of 
existing satellite systems for environmental research is 
incomplete. Top priority studies of the atmosphere are 
described. Existing facilities and programs to study the 
atmosphere, ocean, cryosphere, and land surface are discussed. 
The author charges that there has been insufficient 
consideration of the types of data and data series needed to 
study global climate change. Areas where more studies are 
needed, i.e., the global radiation balance, vegetation cover 
dynamics, interaction of atmosphere and ocean, etc., are 
described. References 32: 15 Russian, 17 Western.
