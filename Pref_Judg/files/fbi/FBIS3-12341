  [Text] Commenting on the Ibrahimi Mosque massacre, 
President Ilyas al-Hirawi has stated: They talk about human 
rights and classify the countries that do not respect these 
rights. Are today's massacre in Hebron and the victims who died 
while praying to God Almighty on the occasion of blessed Ramadan 
included in these human rights? How can this be explained? How 
would it be classified? Is anything more barbaric than this? 
What is the stand of the civilized world demanding human rights 
vis-a-vis such a massacre that reminds us of the Hitler era? 
  President al-Hirawi added: Condemnation is not enough. We 
are waiting for some action and a clear decision from the United 
Nations, the co-sponsors of the Middle East peace conference, 
and the pioneers of freedom led by Europe and especially France. 
  President al-Hirawi then asked: What measures will be taken 
to protect the people in the occupied territories?
