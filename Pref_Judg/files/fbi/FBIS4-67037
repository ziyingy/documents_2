  [Text] President Gaviria spoke and other reactions 
followed. The presidential candidates and the police 
counternarcotics director support Gaviria and agree that 
personal consumption should not be legalized. 
  [Andres Pastrana, presidential candidate of the Conservative 
Party] I totally disagree with the Constitutional Court because 
Colombia is invaded by drugs. We are a drug-producing and 
drug-distributing country. If we open the doors to personal 
use, it will be like offering incentives to increase drug 
addiction rates. The laws must be obeyed, but there has been a 
flaw in the Court. I think we must look for mechanisms that 
will allow us not to be permissive. That is where we must 
direct our efforts. 
  [Unidentified Reporter] What are the good and bad aspects of 
this court decision? 
  [Pastrana] Personally, I don't see anything good about it. 
  [Enrique Parejo, presidential candidate for the Democratic 
National Alternative] I think the Court has made a serious 
mistake. The decision could lead to a considerable increase in 
drug use in the country. If running a red light and thereby 
endangering the lives and physical wellbeing of persons is 
subject to sanction even if nothing happens, that is all the 
more reason why the use of drugs should be sanctioned. 
  [Miguel Maza, presidential candidate of the National Civic 
Consensus] For me it is a legal absurdity. It is impossible to 
conceive of the law as a cold summation of a series of norms 
that are totally alien from the wishes and feelings of a people. 
After carefully analyzing the clamor made by mothers, fathers, 
the clergy, and the government in expressing their opinions, the 
only thing left for these five magistrates to do is resign.
