  [Text] Tokyo, March 14 KYODO -- Prime Minister Morihiro 
Hosokawa will broach the sensitive issue of human rights with 
top Chinese leaders when he visits Beijing from Saturday [19 
March], government sources said Monday. 
  The sources said Hosokawa will call on China in talks with 
Communist Party chief Jiang Zemin and Prime Minister Li Peng to 
"urgently address (the human rights issue) in a manner which can 
be understood by the international community." 
  The Japanese leader's projected Beijing visit comes on the 
heels of that by U.S. Secretary of State Warren Christopher, who 
was coolly rebuffed last week when he took the Chinese 
Government to task over its human rights record. 
  Hosokawa is also expected to take a strong stance on the 
issue in the face of anticipated Chinese insistence that human 
rights are an internal affair, the sources said. 
  They said Hosokawa is likely to answer those arguments by 
suggesting that China could better win external assistance for 
its economic reform program by showing a desire to improve its 
human rights situation. 
  He will probably not, however, touch on specific human 
rights 
cases, such as the detainment of prodemocracy activists, they 
said.
