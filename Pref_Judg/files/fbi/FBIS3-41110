  [Text] Defence Minister Wichit Sukmak said Thailand does 
not support drug trafficking and will cooperate with the 
international police in suppressing the trade in illegal 
narcotics. 
  The minister said if Khun Sa could stop producing heroin as 
he announced, the country's image would be indirectly improved, 
for Thailand has often been accused of being a drug trafficking 
route for the heroin produced by the drug warlord. 
  Thailand was in fact the first country in Southeast Asia to 
persuade hilltribes people to stop producing heroin, thanks to 
the initiative of His Majesty the King, noted Gen Wichit. 
  Meanwhile, Narcotics Suppression Bureau [NSB] Commissioner 
Somchai Milintharangkun announced an increase in the police 
personnel, technology, and rewards to combat drug dealers. 
  Pol Lt-Gen [Police Lieutenant General] Somchai also promised 
to take severe action against careless police who allow drug 
dealers to escape from captivity. Bad police must be ousted. 
NSB police might also be transferred because some are easily 
corrupted by drug dealers when offered money and property. 
  He also had a plan to move drug suppression offices to a 
more 
well-protected area to prevent information on confidential cases 
from being leaked.
