  [Abstract] The increasing popularity of the tissue culture 
method for obtaining plant cell lines with useful agricultural 
attributes and the possibility of obtaining saline resistant 
cell lines by indirect resistance selection for the toxic 
counterpart of proline to L-azetidine-2-carbonic acid as well as 
a lack of known attempts to ascertain which specific mechanism 
determines the resistance displayed by concrete cells or cell 
lines prompted a study of the likely NaCl tolerance mechanisms 
manifested by the selected cell lines. To this end, Northern 3 
Glucine max L. soybean and Trapezond Nicotiana 
tabacum L. tobacco plants were investigated. The callus 
culture was produced from the leaf mesophyll on the B5 medium. 
Selection for stability to L-azetidine-2-carbonic acid in 
soybean and tobacco culture cells made it possible to produce 
cell lines characterized by a certain set of stress factor 
protection mechanisms. It is speculated that the mechanisms of 
stability to azetidinecarboxylate are responsible for the 
selected lines' cell resistance to other limiting factors, e.g., 
salinity. The level of this resistance differs in different 
lines; moreover, the maximum stress resistance was ensured by 
joint incorporation of all proposed protection mechanisms.
