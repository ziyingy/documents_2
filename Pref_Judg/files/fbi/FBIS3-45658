  [Text] Yichang, January 15 (XINHUA) -- Tenders for the 
building of the principal part of the gigantic water control dam 
at the Three Gorges on the middle reaches of the Chang Jiang -- 
the first-phase digging on the left bank -- were opened here 
this afternoon. 
  This was the first opening of tenders for the construction 
of 
principal parts of the Three Gorges water control dam, which is 
expected to take 17 years to finish. 
  The first-phase digging on the left bank of the Chang Jiang 
consists of three parts -- the first-phase digging for a 
permanent ship lock and the course linking the upper and middle 
reaches, the first-stage digging for a ship lift and a temporary 
ship lock, and the first-phase digging for the workshops and 
dikes of the no. 1 through to no. 6 hydroelectric stations at 
the Three Gorges. 
  Eight large Chinese engineering enterprises or company 
groups 
participated in the tendering and competed for the rights to 
undertake the digging according to conditions set by the China 
Chang Jiang Three Gorges Project Development Corporation when 
calling for the tenders. 
  To guarantee fairness and objectivity, and also to ensure 
that the best engineering enterprises are selected, the China 
International Engineering Consultancy Company has been entrusted 
by the China Chang Jiang Three Gorges Project Development 
Corporation to be fully responsible for the assessment of all 
the tenderers this time. 
  It is understood that the assessment will be completed 
before 
the traditional Spring Festival, which falls on February 10. 
The company or group to be awarded the tender is to be decided 
by then.
