Geodesist"] 
  [Text] Geodesy is the science of the Earth, studying its 
shape, structure and evolution, and one part of it--space 
geodesy--performs those same tasks with the aid of spacecraft. 
  A state geodesic network--an aggregate of geodesic points 
located in a certain order on the country's territory--has been 
created and is being developed for practical utilization, and is 
subdivided into classes depending on the distance between the 
points and the precision of their determination. The use of 
spacecraft makes it possible to clarify the coordinates of 
points on the state geodesic network of the first class and 
develop it in inaccessible regions, as well as to perform 
geometric and dynamic tasks of geodesy. 
  The geometric tasks are reduced to determining the position 
of points on the Earth's surface and establishing the geodesic 
ties between continents and islands to adjust them to the 
uniform global system of coordinates, reference individual 
points and objects to triangulation networks and provide support 
for cartography. The shape and dimensions of the Earth are 
clarified, and potential gravitational anomalies of the field 
and the laws of changes in them are determined. 
  This is accomplished via precise measurements and strict 
mathematical calculations, the processing and analysis of which 
make it possible to determine the nature of the movements of 
individual portions of the Earth's crust, help to ascertain 
typical indications of the precursors to earthquakes and, in the 
future, to predict them. 
  All are familiar with the scope of the misfortune that 
natural disasters, and earthquakes in particular, bring to 
mankind. There are an average of 20 powerful tremors around the 
globe every year, one of them catastrophic. There are more than 
100,000 a year in all. They lead to significant and rapid 
changes in the Earth's crust. The shifts in height ranged from 
1.71 to 3.47 meters in Japan in an earthquake in 1923, while in 
India there were shifts on the order of 1.4 meters in 1934. 
  The slow movement of the Earth's crust also brings many 
unpleasantries. The inhabitants of coastal regions of Holland 
have been battling the encroaching seas for centuries now, 
building and augmenting dikes in their path. Some harbors and 
straits in Scandinavia, on the other hand, have become so 
shallow that they can no longer receive oceangoing vessels as a 
result of the uplifting of the land. The capital of Mexico, 
Mexico City, dropped an average of 5.6 meters from 1880 to 1956, 
and Tokyo 3.5 meters in this century alone, with a tenth of that 
city ending up in the Pacific Ocean. The same fate threatens 
Venice. The settlement of the soil in cities occurs from the 
vibration of thousands of machine tools, urban transport engines 
and engineering explosions. It has been established that the 
buildings are settling two or three times faster on major 
streets in Moscow than on side streets. The settlement is still 
measured just in millimeters over several decades, but it must 
be taken into account in the same way as the movements of the 
Earth's crust in the areas of oil and gas pipelines, mineral 
fields and reservoirs. 
  Anomalies in the force of gravity that arise as a 
consequence 
of the uneven distribution of the Earth's density reflect its 
internal structure, especially of the Earth's crust. Space 
geodesy is thus widely used when researching the structure of 
the Earth, prospecting for minerals and studying seasonal 
changes in meteorological factors such as the yearly and daily 
fluctuations in atmospheric pressure, the level of ground water, 
soil moisture content etc. The gravitational field affects the 
trajectory of the flight of shells, missiles and satellites; 
that is why the role of gravimetric determinations is 
exceptionally important. 
  The methods of space geodesy are founded on observations 
from 
Earth satellites, used as mobile aperture sights with 
coordinates that are known at the moment of observation (flares 
or missiles dropped by parachute from a high-flying aircraft or 
balloon were used in the 1920s). The essence of one of the 
methods (synchronized) is as follows. We have two initial points 
A and B and two points to be determined C and D (see figure). In 
order to calculate the coordinates of the latter, it is 
sufficient to measure simultaneously, and in a uniform system, 
the coordinates of the vertical and horizontal angles to the 
satellite at no fewer than two positions. The solid angles 
&agr;&lt;inf&gt; 1&lt;/inf&gt; , &agr;&lt;inf&gt; 2&lt;/inf&gt; , &bgr;&lt;inf&gt; 1&lt;/inf&gt; , 
&bgr;&lt;inf&gt; 2&lt;/inf&gt; , &ggr;&lt;inf&gt; 1&lt;/inf&gt; , &ggr;&lt;inf&gt; 2&lt;/inf&gt; , 
&dgr;&lt;inf&gt; 1&lt;/inf&gt;  and &dgr;&lt;inf&gt; 2&lt;/inf&gt;  are computed according to 
them. The points S&lt;inf&gt; i&lt;/inf&gt;  and S&lt;inf&gt; 2&lt;/inf&gt;  are then 
obtained by solving the triangles ABS&lt;inf&gt; 1&lt;/inf&gt;  and 
ABS&lt;inf&gt; 2&lt;/inf&gt; , and the coordinates of the unknown points C 
and D from the shape S&lt;inf&gt; 1&lt;/inf&gt;  S&lt;inf&gt; 2&lt;/inf&gt;  CD. It is 
necessary to have a minimum of three initial points and two 
observations of the target position from above for a more 
reliable determination of the coordinates of an aperture sight. 
The data are processed using the least-squares method.

  Optical (angular and rangefinder) as well as radio 
(rangefinder, Doppler) systems measuring the position of the 
craft in relation to ground points are used to reference points 
relative to which the spacecraft is located in the field of view 
over a certain period of time (or simultaneously). The high 
precision of the measurements is ensured by fixing the time of 
measurement as set by the on-board standard. 
  Work on the creation of a uniform system of coordinates for 
the whole Earth's surface and the establishment of geodesic 
links between continents and islands was begun in our country in 
1973 using Kosmos series spacecraft. The GEO-IK geodesic system 
is currently in operation, and makes it possible to perform the 
basic and applied tasks of creating a basic 
astronomical-geodesic network and regional geodesic networks for 
Antarctica, Europe and Asia, including the geodesic referencing 
of islands, supporting operations on the Pacific shelf, 
determining the characteristics of the Earth's gravitational 
field and the maritime geoid and the parameters of the rotation 
and shape of the Earth, as well as the foundations for 
topographic pictures of major objects under construction. 
  The system includes a space segment, including one or two 
satellites, a ground command-and-control system for the craft 
and a land-based geodesic system with a center for the 
processing of special information and an observation point (up 
to 80 points on the entire Earth's surface). 
  The spacecraft are placed in circular orbits 1,500 
kilometers 
high, with an inclination of 74&deg; or 83&deg;, by a Tsiklon 
launch vehicle from the Plesetsk cosmodrome. The distance 
between the reference points is up to 6,000 km. The support zone 
is the entire surface of the Earth, including the polar regions. 
The craft is equipped with a gravitational orientation and 
stabilization system, a system for light signaling, angular 
reflectors with an effective area of 0.024 m&lt;sup&gt; 2&lt;/sup&gt;  and a 
radio system, including a radio altimeter (accuracy of 
measurement of altitude to sea level of 3--5 meters), a Doppler 
system and a transmitter for the rangefinder polling system. 
  The ground stations include radio Doppler gear supporting 
measurement of the radial component of the spacecraft velocity 
in non-polling mode relative to the ground observation point 
(mean square error of 1--3 cm/sec), an astronomical installation 
to determine the direction to the spacecraft (mean square error 
of 1.5"), radio rangefinding polling gear for measuring the 
distance from the ground observation point to the craft (mean 
square error of 3--5 meters) and a laser rangefinder for these 
same purposes (mean square error of 1.5 meters). 
  The information received from the ground observation 
stations 
on the communications channels comes to the center for 
processing special information, where a database is created from 
which all of the information is issued by the computer upon 
customer request. The number of users is unlimited. This 
information, along with traditional means, makes it possible to 
perform the tasks of geodesy. The space geodesic systems support 
the creation of regional geodesic networks, the foundations for 
mapping, the fulfillment of requests for coordinate references 
of points in a required system of coordinates etc. with higher 
quality, and some tasks only it can perform (supporting 
operations on the Pacific shelf, studying its topography, 
geodesic referencing of islands). Gravimetric surveying using 
spacecraft considerably accelerates the study of the Earth's 
gravitational field.

    Analogous work on the creation of a state geodesic network 
is 
underway in the United States, where the WGS-84 system of 
geodesic parameters, allowing support for a precision of the 
determination of geodesic points of 1--2 meters, is the 
foundation. The Geos-3 and Geosat spacecraft, among others, have 
been used for these purposes. The coordinates of ground points 
and the relief of the ocean surfaces have been determined, the 
shape of the geoid has been clarified and a gravitational model 
of the Earth has been created using them. The Lageos-2 craft is 
currently in orbit. The launch of the Gravsat-A and Gravsat-B, 
which should provide for the measurement of parameters of the 
field with a precision of 0.1 meters for the height of the geoid 
and the determination of the acceleration of the field of 
gravity with a precision of 1 mgal (0.001 cm/sec&lt;sup&gt; 2&lt;/sup&gt; ), 
is planned to study the fine structure of the Earth's 
gravitational field. 
  Navigational spacecraft are also used to develop the 
geodesic 
network and perform individual geodesic tasks.
