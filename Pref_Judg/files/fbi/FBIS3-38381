  [Text] Saint-Gall, Switzerland, Feb 2 (AFP) -- The wreck 
of a twin-engine aircraft has been found 160 metres below the 
surface of Lake Constance, Swiss police said Tuesday [1 
February]. 
  It was not immediately clear if the plane was the 
German-registered Cessna aircraft that disappeared last week 
shortly before landing at the Alternrhein airstrip near here 
with 70 kilograms of radioactive caesium-137 aboard. 
  A robot sub would be sent down Wednesday to inspect the 
wreckage, police said. 
  Geiger counter readings taken near the wreckage Tuesday did 
not show any increased radiation, police said. The lake 
supplies drinking water to four million people in northern 
Switzerland.
