<F P=106> [Statement by Andres Pastrana, presidential candidate of the </F>
Colombian Conservative Party; place and date not given--live or 
recorded] 
  [Excerpts] Good afternoon. I am going to speak sincerely 
and directly, face to face with you, about the changes I will 
make if you elect me as your president on 29 May. I am going to 
tell you about my plans to make Colombia a nation of 
opportunities where we can be sure of getting a good education, 
being able to walk the streets safely, and finding a decent job.

  Previous governments have believed mistakenly that 
guerrillas 
and narcotraffickers are the only ones who deserve attention 
from the state, thus neglecting daily security. That is why I 
have proposed the creation of a specialized group, so that just 
as groups that counter guerrillas, kidnappings, and 
narcotrafficking, it can dedicate itself to dismantling and 
breaking up, once and for all, the mafia of common criminals who 
disrupt in the country's main cities and the tranquillity of 
citizens. 
  It is critical that we support the prosecutor general's work 
to definitively eliminate impunity. Nothing is more infuriating 
or frustrating than to see crimes go unpunished and criminals 
mocking their victims because they know they will not be 
punished. Even worse is the scenario where a victim, the 
citizen, is mistreated by a bureaucratized, inoperative, and 
inefficient justice system. For example, a citizen files 
charges and fails to recover stolen goods but must fear 
retribution from the thief he identified. We must guarantee 
citizens that they will receive prompt and full justice through 
fair punishment of the criminal. 
  Our personal safety is now jeopardized by the Constitutional 
Court's ruling on the legality of specific drug quantities for 
personal use. This is unacceptable and inconceivable. We 
cannot allow them to bury our dream of a better Colombia. As a 
parent, I cannot accept this and you can't either, because we 
want healthy children and young people. I do not want those who 
represent our future to fall under the effects of narcotics. I 
will not allow them to murder our future. I do not want to see 
the criminal selling drugs or killing our efforts to restore 
values, family, education, and everyday safety. No to drugs! I 
have always said this and will always say it: I will not budge! 
  I am not one of those who today says no to the court's 
decision but who yesterday was one of the ones who proposed 
legalization. Or maybe they believe that the marijuana of 15 
years ago was less harmful than the kind consumed in the streets 
today? What nonsense! No to drugs! Following the legalization 
of the personal dosage comes the legalization of drug 
trafficking. Make no mistake about that. In this struggle 
against the killers of our future, we have paid a high price in 
lives, kidnappings, and grief. That cost will not be fruitless. 
No parent who really loves his children, no teacher who values 
his students, no Colombian who thinks about Colombia can agree 
with those who favor legalization. I will not permit it.
