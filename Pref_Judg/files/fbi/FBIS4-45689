  Philip Fearnside, scientist for the National Institute for 
Amazon Region Research in Manaus, on 5 May criticized a bill 
that authorizes fiscal incentives for the installation, 
modernization, and development of industrial and agricultural 
jobs through 31 December 2000 in areas under the jurisdiction of 
the Amazon Regional Development Superintendency and the 
Northeast Development Superintendency. The bill was submitted by 
Senator Marco Maciel, and already has been passed by the Senate 
and the Chamber of Deputies. He said the fiscal incentive policy 
for the Amazon promoted by the military government greatly 
contributed to the huge deforestation of the Amazon with the 
implementation of agricultural and livestock projects in humid 
tropical forests. (Rio de Janeiro JORNAL DO BRASIL in Portuguese

  President Itamar Franco has ordered the release of 1.8 
billion cruzeiros to continue the demarcation of the Quilombo do 
Flexal reserve in Maranhao. Federal Deputy Haroldo Saboya said 
the government guaranteed the Quilombo do Flexal reserve but 
failed to renew the reserve status of the Ciriaco, Mata Grande, 
and Extremo Norte forests in Tocantins. The three reserves will 
have to wait one year to be subject to a new demarcation by the 
Brazilian Institute for the Environment and Renewable Natural 
Resources. (Rio de Janeiro JORNAL DO BRASIL in Portuguese 24 May
