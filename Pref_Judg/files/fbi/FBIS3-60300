  [Text] Tokyo December 20 TASS--Russia will have to dump 
liquid radioactive waste into the sea for at least the next two 
years, according to Valeriy Danilyan, head of the Pacific Fleet 
Chemical Defense Service. 
  Danilyan is in Tokyo to participate in the two-day 
Russian-Japanese consultations on the prevention of radioactive 
waste dumping into the sea. In an interview with ITAR-TASS on 
Monday, he said that even if western countries launch an 
immediate aid to Russia to build special facilities to utilize 
liquid radioactive waste, it will take two years at the minimum 
to complete the work. "During this period we will have to dump 
waste into the sea if no alternative solution is found," he said. 
  "Two specialised tankers the Pacific Fleet has to store 
radioactive waste, which, by the way, are almost beyond repairs, 
are completely full. If the waste is not vented, then there 
will be no place to store new low-toxic waste to be released 
from dismantled nuclear submarines," Danilyan said. 
  At present 17 nuclear submarines have already been 
dismantled 
and 50 more are awaiting their turn, he added. Danilyan also 
pointed out that the radioactive discharge into the Sea of Japan 
in October has not damaged the environment. He noted, while 
stressing that this is his personal point of view, that "the 
discharge of liquid low-toxic waste does not pose any threat." 
  He also believes that the best place to dump radioactive 
waste is the open waters of the Pacific Ocean which are far away 
from the territorial waters of all states of the region. "But 
our tankers cannot sail far away from the coast because they 
were built more than 30 years ago and have long become 
obsolete," Danilyan concluded.
