to other products, there was practically no change. Since the 
beginning of the month vegetable prices have gone up by 22 
percent, and those for meat and milk products remained 
practically unchanged. 
  The cost of the consumer basket of 19 basic 
foodstuffs increased over the week by 1.4 percent and as of

basis. The price differential between monitored cities measured 
a factor of 4. In terms of the cost of consumer basket, St. 
Petersburg and Moscow ranked 34th and 39th among 132 monitored 
cities (R49,200 and R48,000 on a monthly basis).

<H5>  Export and Import Through Barter Operations </H5>
  According to Russian Goskomstat [State Committee on 
Statistics] data, Russia's barter (exchange of goods not 
involving monetary payments) turnover with far abroad foreign 
countries in 1993 amounted to $8.678 billion and increased as 
compared to 1992 by 30 percent, including $4.941 billion worth 
of exports (by 37 percent) and $3.737 worth of imports (by 22 
percent). 
  The value of barter operations is estimated either at world 
prices or at prices of individual deals for similar goods. 
  Of the total volume of Russia's export-import operations in 
1993, barter accounted for: exports--11.5 percent (8.5 percent 
in 1992); imports--13.8 percent (8.3 percent in 1992). 
  The predominant items in barter exports were raw materials 
and semifinished goods (about 70 percent); received in exchange 
were consumer goods (more than 60 percent). 
  The following goods led the list in terms of volume of 
barter 
exports:

  Russia's barter operations turnover with China in 1993 
amounted to $2.965 billion (34 percent of the total volume of 
barter turnover); with Germany--$526 million (6.1 percent); 
Switzerland--$412 million (4.7 percent); Hungary--$296 million 
(3.4 percent); Great Britain--$250 million (2.9 percent); the 
Netherlands--$238 million (2.7 percent); and the United 
States--$227 million (2.6 percent). 
<H5>  Housing Conditions of the Population </H5>
  As of the beginning of 1994, 9.1 million families, or 18 
percent of all families, were on waiting lists of local 
authorities, enterprises, and organizations for housing. As 
compared to the preceding year, the number of families on the 
waiting list in Russia as a whole dropped by 542,000. 
  Of the total number of families on housing waiting lists in 
Russia, 15 percent live in communal apartments, 13 percent--in 
dormitories, and 4 percent--in decrepit and dilapidated housing; 
15 percent have been on the waiting list for 10 or more years. 
  In 1993, 897,000 families, or 51,000 fewer than in 1992, 
received housing or improved their living conditions; of them, 
826,000 had been on waiting lists; 828,000 new families were put 
on waiting lists and 640,000 removed for a variety of reasons. 
  The dynamics of improvement in the population's living 
conditions over a number of years are characterized by the 
following data: 


                    1990          1991           1992          1993

<H5>  Status of Coal Production in Main Coal Basins </H5>
  In 1993 production of coal in Russia as a whole and in the 
main coal basins continued to decline. Indicators that 
characterize the situation with the main coal basins in 1993 are 
shown in the table below:

  The decline in the volume of coal production stems to a 
considerable extent from the diminished investment in sector 
development. In 1993 alone the volume of capital investment from 
all sources of financing has dropped as compared to 1992 by 25 
percent. 
  The shortage of money speeded up the process of shrinkage of 
the coal production base. Over 1991-1993, as a result of 
depletion of deposits and changes in mining and geological 
conditions, capacities for production of 78.6 million tonnes of 
coal went off line, while capacities for production of only 21.2 
million tonnes were put on line, including for 20.8 million 
tonnes and 6.8 million tonnes in 1993, respectively. 
  Higher prices for the coal produced do not solve the problem 
of lack of money to invest in sector development. In 1993 coal 
prices grew as compared to 1992 10.2-fold, while rates for 
railroad freight increased 18.2-fold. 
  Nonpayments for products shipped keep growing. The total 
amount of coal enterprises' accounts receivable as of 1 January 
1994 amounted to R1.1 trillion. As of 1 March 1994, 20.2 million 
tonnes of coal had accumulated at coal-producing enterprises' 
warehouses, which is twice as high as the norm. 
  Loss of work time as a result of strikes is increasing. 
While 
in 1992 it amounted to 91,000 man-days, in 1993 the number grew 
to 140,000, of which 64,000 were lost in January-February of 
this year. 
  The decline in coal production is to a large degree a result 
of the reduction in the volume of preparatory work and the 
resulting diminished front of mineral extraction work. In 1993 
the volume of opening and preparation work declined as compared 
to 1992 in Russia as a whole by 12 percent, including at 
Kuznetsk Basin enterprises by 13 percent, at the Primorskugol 
association--by 16 percent, at Severovostokugol--by 17 percent, 
while at the Yakutugol association it increased by 11 percent. 
The average operating length of stoping faces decreased by 7 
percent, including at Kuznetsk Basin--by 10 percent, and 
Severovostokugol--by 26 percent. The level of labor 
mechanization in the sector is falling. The proportional share 
of coal production in faces with hydraulically operated lining 
where integrated mechanization is used fell from 84 percent in 
1994 to 80 percent in 1993. Maritime Kray and Sakhalin mines 
remain the least mechanized--the share of coal produced by the 
aforementioned kind of faces there comprised 52 percent and 57 
percent in 1993, respectively. 
  In January-February of this year 50.3 million tonnes of coal 
was produced in the Russian Federation, which is 8 percent less 
than over the analogous period of last year, including in the 
Kuznetsk Basin--10 percent less, Donetsk--5 percent less, and 
the Far East--23 percent less. Production of coal in the Pechora 
Basin increased by 3 percent, and in Kansk-Achinsk--by 7 percent. 
<H5>  Material and Technical Base of Farmers Markets </H5>
  As of the beginning of the current year, 1,874 farmers 
markets were operating in the Russian Federation. As compared to 
the beginning of 1993 their number declined by 111 (6 percent). 
  Of the total number of markets, 57 percent were the property 
of consumer cooperatives, 24 percent were state-owned, 15 
percent--privately owned, and 4 percent were of mixed ownership. 
  The status of the material and technical base of farmers 
markets is characterized by the following data:

  Currently, one out of every four markets are of the enclosed 
variety. There are no enclosed markets in the republics of Tuva, 
Karachay-Cherkessia, Kostroma, Tula, and Astrakhan Oblasts, and 
Yevreyskaya Autonomous Oblast. Half of the markets are not 
equipped with mechanically powered refrigerating equipment. On 
average there are only two mechanically powered refrigerators 
per market, one cooler or one refrigeration chamber. One out of 
two markets does not have a veterinary and health inspection 
laboratory. 
  Hotels and farmers boarding facilities exist only at one out 
of 20 markets (of them, one-quarter are in Moscow and 9 percent 
in St. Petersburg). 
<H5>  Consumer Services Enterprises </H5>
  As of the beginning of 1994 in Russia the organs of state 
statistics counted officially on record 86,556 consumer services 
enterprises of all forms of property, which is 5 percent fewer 
than a year ago--a result of the liquidation of some of them. 
  The distribution of consumer services enterprises by form of 
ownership as of 1 January 1994 is characterized by the following 
data:

  The share of the private sector is higher among enterprises 
engaged in custom shoe-making (45 percent of the number of 
facilities providing this service), shoe repair (47 percent), 
and beauty salons (45 percent). 
<H5>  Serving Passengers in Intercity Transportation </H5>
  The organs of state statistics have conducted a selective 
survey of the quality of passenger service in airports and on 
airplanes, at railroad stations and on long-distance trains. The 
sample of passengers who answered the questionnaire at railroad 
stations and long-distance trains included 1,643 persons, and in 
airports and airplanes--703 persons. 
  The survey showed that quality of service, which should be a 
decisive criteria of an enterprise's ability to compete, 
currently remains low.

  At railroads only one half of the respondents had been able 
to purchase train tickets at advance ticket sale facilities; 39 
percent of respondents were able to do so only at the ticket 
window at the station on the day of departure. In doing this, 
873 persons (53 percent) spent more than half an hour waiting in 
line for the tickets, and of them, 272 persons (17 percent) 
spent between one and three hours, and 113 persons (7 percent) 
more than three hours. 
  Long waiting lines at rail station ticket windows (between 
one and three hours) was noted by many passengers in Kursk, 
Saransk, Moscow, Tambov, Kirov, Volgograd, and Samara; more than 
three hours--in Tambov, Kirov, Nizhniy Novgorod, and Saransk. 
  Passenger complaints regarding the operation of ticket 
windows note first and foremost the tactless behavior of ticket 
window personnel (41 percent dissatisfied), as well as the fact 
that they were offered a different category of car (26 percent), 
not the train they wanted (13 percent), or a different departure 
date (14 percent). 
  Unmet demand for rail tickets gives rise to abuses: 107 
persons (6.5 percent) had to buy tickets from scalpers. The 
greatest number of such instances was noted in Saransk (18), 
Tambov (12), Lipetsk (8), and Kirov (6). Shortage of rail 
tickets is frequently created artificially or arises from poor 
organization of ticket window operations. This is supported by 
the fact that 284 persons (42 percent of the number of those 
dissatisfied with ticket window operations) noted a great number 
of vacant seats on the train while no tickets had been available 
at the window. Many such instances were noted especially on 
trains departing from Saransk, Moscow, Kirov, Tambov, 
Vladivostok, Blagoveshchensk, and Astrakhan. 
  Two-thirds of the survey respondents--1,085 persons--were 
dissatisfied with waiting hall operations. The greatest number 
of complaints (68 percent of those dissatisfied) were prompted 
by the fact that waiting halls are overcrowded--people have to 
sit on the floor and on their luggage--as well as stations' 
unsatisfactory sanitary conditions (66 percent). An especially 
great number of passengers noted the crowded waiting halls at 
rail stations of Vologda, Orenburg, Ulyanovsk, Rostov-na-Donu, 
Tyumen, Khabarovsk, Cheboksary, Saransk, Orel, Tambov, 
Vladivostok, Kazan, and Moscow; and unsanitary conditions--in 
Arkhangelsk, Saransk, Khabarovsk, Astrakhan, Volgograd, St. 
Petersburg, Yaroslavl, Vladivostok, Ivanovo, Kostroma, Moscow, 
Krasnoyarsk, and Orenburg. 
  More than 1,000 respondents were dissatisfied with the 
organization of public catering at stations. The situation is 
worst with respect to this service in Cheboksary, Saransk, 
Krasnodar, Stavropol, Vladivostok, Lipetsk, Tyumen, Izhevsk, 
Tomsk, Kazan, Novgorod, St. Petersburg, Moscow, Petrozavodsk, 
Yekaterinburg, Belgorod, Ryazan, Pskov, and Blagoveshchensk. 
  Of almost 500 persons who needed to use mother-and-child 
facilities, only 44 percent were able to do so. 
  Most passengers who participated in the survey traveled in 
sleeping compartment (36 percent) and regular sleeping (50 
percent) cars. The condition of cars left 714 persons, or almost 
half of all respondents, dissatisfied. Of them, the overwhelming 
majority (69 percent) pointed out the unsanitary conditions of 
restrooms; one half noted malfunctioning lighting, electric 
outlets, or wire radio; 37 percent--unsatisfactory ventilation 
of rail cars; 33 percent--dirt in passageways; and 30 
percent--unavailability of boiled water. 
  The greatest number of complaints regarding the unsanitary 
condition of trains was voiced with respect to trains operated 
by the Moscow, Gorkiy, and Baykal-Amur Railroads; various 
malfunctions of doors, windows, and various equipment--on trains 
operated by the Moscow, North-Caucasus, Sverdlovsk, Transbaykal, 
and Baykal-Amur Railroads. 
  Half of surveyed passengers were not offered tea on the 
train. More than three-quarters of passengers were not provided 
this elementary service on the trains operated by the Volga, 
West-Siberian, Far-Eastern, and Baykal-Amur Railroads. 
  Only 162 persons, or less than 10 percent of respondents, 
used the services of the dining car (on-board food service 
counter). Of them, 63 percent were left unsatisfied with the 
quality and assortment of food, and 36 percent encountered poor 
service. The greatest complaints were noted with respect to 
operation of dining cars on trains operated by the Moscow, 
Kyubyshev, South-Urals, and Far-Eastern Railroads. 
  In air transportation, despite considerable fare increases 
the population's demand for transportation is still not fully 
met. For instance, 31 percent of surveyed passengers were not 
able to purchase a ticket for the departure date they wanted, 
and 22 percent--for the desired flight. At the same time, 46 
percent of respondents noted that while no tickets were 
available at the ticket window, there were vacant seats in the 
aircraft cabin. Eight percent of passengers spent more than 
three hours in order to purchase tickets; 7 percent spent 
between one and three hours, 19 percent--between 30 and 60 
minutes, and 66 percent--less than 30 minutes. 
  As a result of lines and tactless ticket window clerks, 33 
percent of passengers expressed dissatisfaction with this 
service. A great number of complaints were voiced by passengers 
in Voronezh, Kazan, Groznyy, Kurgan, Irkutsk, Kyzyl, 
Vladivostok, Tyumen, Blagoveshchensk, and Krasnodar. 
  Passenger service at airports is also characterized by low 
quality. These days, when scheduled flights are frequently 
canceled and passengers forced to spend several days at the 
airport waiting for their flight due to disruptions in fuel 
deliveries, the problem of quality service is especially acute. 
The survey showed that airport services cope poorly with this 
task. More than half of surveyed passengers were dissatisfied 
with waiting halls operations; of them, 49 percent noted 
overcrowding, 64 percent--unsatisfactory sanitary conditions, 25 
percent--malfunctioning ventilation and lighting, and 27 
percent--too few restrooms. Unsatisfactory operation of 
communication services at airports was noted by 47 percent of 
passengers; of them, 35 percent noted too few functioning 
long-distance telephones, 44 percent--poor organization of 
coin-changing operation, and 15 percent--no facilities to send a 
cable. Operation of airport information kiosks was found 
unsatisfactory by 30 percent of respondents. Half of the 
passengers encountered poor luggage handling, of whom 25 percent 
noted difficulties encountered in checking luggage at the 
checkroom, 37 percent--absence of automatic storage lockers, and 
52 percent--long wait for luggage after the flight; 42 percent 
of passengers had their luggage damaged or lost in 
transportation. 
  Especially low quality of service was noted at airports in 
the following cities: Groznyy, Samara, Yakutsk, Gorno-Altaysk, 
Magadan, Vladivostok, Blagoveshchensk, Makhachkala, and Kurgan. 
  Passengers these days also get minimal convenience and 
comfort on board the aircraft as well. Of passengers 
dissatisfied with the condition of the aircraft cabin, 43 
percent pointed out unsatisfactory sanitary conditions, 78 
percent--malfunctioning passenger seats, lighting, and 
ventilation, and 32 percent--unsatisfactory condition of 
lavatories. 
  Especially many complaints regarding the condition of the 
aircraft cabin came from passengers flying on aircraft of the 
Domodedovo production association (59 percent of respondents) 
and enterprises that are part of the Yakutsk (50 percent), 
Southern (40 percent), and Komi (38 percent) regional civil 
aviation administrations. 
  The most common service offered to passengers aboard 
aircraft 
was refreshments (this service was offered to 69 percent of 
respondents). In addition, 29 percent were offered newspapers 
and magazines, 15 percent--souvenirs, 6 percent--board games, 
and 1 percent--a video to view. One-fifth of passengers were 
offered no services at all.
