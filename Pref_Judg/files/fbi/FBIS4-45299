  [Text] Opium Warlord Khun Sa is financing the Karen 
National Union [KNU], led by Gen Bo Mya, in an attempt to 
strengthen the fighting alliance against the Burmese government, 
a reliable source said. 
  Financial support from Khun Sa is believed to total up to 
three million baht, which was handed over to the KNU at a 
meeting in Maneplaw between April 15-17, the source added. 
  Maj-Gen Tun of Khun Sa's Muang Tai Army [MTA] led the 
representative from Shan State in a meeting with Karen guerrilla 
leaders, the source claimed an intelligence report as saying. 
  Both sides received their respective benefits from the move, 
the source remarked. 
  Khun Sa gave financial support to the KNU to secure shipment 
of heroin from the Golden Triangle, the source said adding that 
the first shipment would be from Shan State down the Salween 
River to Moulmein. 
  Khun Sa wanted the shipment secured as it passes areas 
influenced by the KNU, according to the source. 
  The KNU, on the other hand, is believed to be seeking 
financial support from the opium warlord to stage its 
anti-Burmese government operations. 
  The move is the latest development between Gen Bo Mya and 
Khun Sa whose first contact was believed to have been in 1991. 
  Their meeting was designed to strengthen the two 
anti-government groups in fighting Burmese government forces. 
  Prior to the recent secret meeting, both sides met at least 
twice in March and early April to discuss cooperative efforts 
against the Burmese regime. 
  The source said the first shipment of drugs is expected to 
take place after fighting between the MTA and government forces 
subsides, which is expected soon due to the approaching rainy 
season, the source said. 
  The ongoing fighting is seen as an attempt by Khun Sa to 
demonstrate a show of strength and to boost confidence within 
his heroin buying network, the source pointed out. 
  Officials of Khun Sa's Muang Tai Army, contacted by BANGKOK 
POST yesterday, declined comment on the matter.
