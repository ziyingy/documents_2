  [Text] The Coordinating Council of the Democratic Russia 
movement has sent a letter to President Yeltsin voicing its 
support for the president-initiated policy of civil accord. 
  The letter says, however, that the memorandum on civil peace 
between the main political forces should be amended. It should 
include a mechanism for ensuring all the signatories abide by 
it. The adoption of a law banning fascism and extremism by the 
Federal Assembly might provide such a guarantee. 
  The Democratic Russia movement also insists that 
representatives of political forces which violate Russian laws, 
provoke mass disturbances, instigate national enmity and 
advocate war and violence, should not be allowed to sign this 
memorandum.
