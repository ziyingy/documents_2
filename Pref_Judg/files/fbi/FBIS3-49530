  [Text] The Slovak Government took an unambiguously positive 
stance and demonstrated unreserved support to the Partnership 
for Peace initiative at its first meeting this year, which took 
place today. 
  Foreign Minister Jozef Moravcik said at a news conference 
that he had been authorized by the government to immediately set 
up working groups for drafting contractual documents on 
Slovakia's joining this initiative.
