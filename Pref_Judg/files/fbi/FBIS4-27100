  [Text] Chaing Mai -- Thai and US anti-drug authorities 
yesterday arrested a couple in Muang district with 33 kg of 
heroin worth at least Bt47 million on the local market, police 
said. 
  Somnuk Sisaowarak, 29, and Khruawan Monlai, 39, who are 
natives of Mae Hong Son, were arrested at their house in a 
estate on the Chiang Mai-Hot road with 55 bags of powdered 
heroin and 40 bars of compressed heroin, according to police. 
  The team that raided their house also seized one AK-47 
assault rifle, two pistols and more than 50,000 rounds of M-16 
ammunition. 
  Investigators said the two claimed the heroin came from 
Burmese drug warlord Khun Sa, who wanted to trade the drug for 
arms to be used in fighting with Burmese government forces. 
  Khun Sa's army has been engaged in battles with Rangoon 
which 
have intensified recently. 
  The suspects said they were planning to sell the heroin in 
Bangkok. The proceeds would have been used to buy arms from 
traders at the eastern border. The weapons seized by police 
yesterday were also intended to be sent to the warlord, 
according to police. 
  The raid was carried out jointly by local police, officers 
from the Office of the Narcotics Control Board and agents of the 
US Drug Enforcement Administration.
