  [Text] The international Russian-Japanese-[South] Korean 
expedition aboard the scientific research vessel Okean recently 
conducted a survey of regions for the storage in the Sea of 
Japan of the Pacific Fleet's liquid radioactive waste. 
Measurements of the concentration of radioactive matter in 
seawater, sediments on the ocean's bottom, and vegetation and 
animal life showed that everything was within the norms of 
natural background [radiation]. This confirmed again that the 
recent dumping of waste carried out in October 1993 posed no 
danger.
