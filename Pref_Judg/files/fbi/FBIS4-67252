  [Text] The executive branch believes that 80 to 90 percent 
of the coca leaf produced in Chapare is earmarked for drug 
trafficking. Minister German Quiroga stated that it has 
therefore been decided to regulate the use of coca leaf through 
a supreme decree. Quiroga, however, issued some warnings. 
  [Begin Quiroga recording] The decree states in what zone of 
the country this regulation regarding the industrialization of 
coca leaf should be implemented. We were under the impression 
that some coca farmers wanted to decriminalize coca production, 
but the government has no intention of doing that as the entire 
country is aware that approximately 80 or maybe 90 percent of 
the surplus coca leaf produced in Chapare is earmarked for drug 
trafficking. [end recording] 
  Minister Quiroga made a clear comparison. He said that on 
one hand there is the good coca, which is used for chewing and 
for industrial purposes, and on the other there is the bad coca, 
and we must not forget that. The bad coca is essentially that 
produced in Chapare which, in turn, is used to produce cocaine. 
  Nobody should therefore have any illusions that coca is 
going 
to freely circulate in Bolivia. That would be like giving 
cocaine carte blanche.
