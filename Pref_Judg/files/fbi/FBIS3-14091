  [Text] Numerous serious incidents took place in the 
territories today. Palestinian sources reported that dozens of 
people were wounded. At several locations, including Hebron, 
the clashes took place when the Army removed the curfew for 
several hours in order to permit local residents to buy 
provisions and youths began hurling rocks at the soldiers. 
  A pregnant woman was apparently killed by IDF [Israel 
Defense 
Forces] gunfire in Hebron. The IDF is investigating the 
circumstances of the incident. A girl from the Jabalyah refugee 
camp in the Gaza Strip died from her wounds this morning after 
being wounded in a shooting incident with soldiers several days 
ago.
