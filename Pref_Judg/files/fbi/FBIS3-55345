  [Text] While talking to journaliists, Vladimir 
Zhirinovskiy, leader of Russian nationalists, has confirmed his 
readiness to come to Poland. 
  [Correspondent Andrzej Siezieniewski] Vladimir Zhirinovskiy 
was in a hurry to attend the first meeting of the parliamentary 
floor group of his party, but when he learned that we were from 
Poland, he stopped and spared a moment for us. 
  [Zhirinovskiy, in Russian with superimposed Polish 
translation] "We have the highest brotherly feelings toward you. 
We are Slavs. The hostility of the period of the Czarist 
empire and the period of communism, humiliations, suffering, big 
brother, little brother -- this is all a thing of the past. We 
live side by side. We are neighbors and Slavs, and we would like 
Poland to be always a flourishing and democratic state." 
  [Siezieniewski] Asked whom he would like to talk to in 
Warsaw, he replied: 
  [Zhirinovskiy] "To everybody, the president, the head of 
government, Sejm deputies and leaders of every party and public 
organization. With journalists as well. I would like to talk 
with them about us ceasing to look at each other with hostility. 
How long could it last. You are Catholics, we are Orthodox. 
Is this sufficient reason to divide people? Let us take 
Yugoslavia as an example. The Orthodox Serbs and Catholic 
Croats are shooting at each other. This is a manifestation of 
savagery." 
  [Siezieniewski] We took the opportunity to ask him about his 
position toward Poland's plans to join NATO. 
  [Zhirinowskiy] "Negative. Let us all be neutral and neither 
we nor you join. Do not think that they are waiting for you 
there. Even if that is so, it is waiting for servants who would 
polish the boots of German or British generals. They would 
force you to feed foreign divisions, they would behave like 
peasants." 
  [Siezieniewski] This is what the leader of Russian Liberal 
Democrats maintains, and he adds: 
  [Zhirinowskiy] "Blacks from America will come over and kick 
you in the face. You are going to be a testing ground and a 
dump. You must understand that a neutral Poland and security 
guarantees for the whole of East Europe are what we need. 
  "We Russians have never had an urge to push west. We have 
problems in the south. So, if you want, we will give you Lvov 
back. Do not join NATO in any case." 
  [Siezieniewski] Finally, returning once again to his Polish 
sentiments, Vladimir Zhirinovskiy said: 
  [Zhirinovskiy] "I like Poles. My two deputies Zhebrovskiy 
and Vengerovskiy are of Polish origin. I want you to know that 
we are a normal democratic party. There is neither fascism nor 
communism nor any other extremism in us. We are for the best 
possible relations with Poland." 
  [Siezieniewski] During the first meeting of the Liberal 
Democrats parliamentary floor group, to which he was going, he 
pronounced himself for maintaining the strong presidential power 
and equally strong parliament. He accepts the new constitution 
90 percent. He believes that the time will come when Russia 
will be able to become a real parliamentary republic without any 
dictatorship.
