  [Text] TALLINN, Apr 07, BNS - The 58 Kurds who recently 
arrived illegally in Estonia were taken into the country through 
Narva, not through southeastern Estonia, Border Guard Department 
Director Tarmo Kouts told BNS. 
  Kouts, whom Interior Minister Heiki Arike appointed as head 
of a working group to investigate the incident, held yesterday 
and today talks with Russian border guard officials. 
  "The talks haven't so far brought a definite result," Kouts 
said. "The Russian officials claimed they hadn't as yet been 
authorized to let the Kurds back into Russia, but they didn't 
deny that they ought to receive them." 
  Kouts confirmed that the chief of Russia's Pskov border 
guard 
unit wanted to solve the Kurdish issue on the level of the two 
countries' border guard authorities, without involving the 
foreign ministries. 
  The leader of the Estonian border guards told BNS there was 
no information to confirm allegations that some Estonian 
officials were paid for allowing the Kurds into the country. 
  "The Kurds give contradictory statements and are afraid to 
speak, because they were smuggled into Estonia by the Russian 
mafia and people's lives may be at stake," Kouts explained. 
  He said it is not yet clear what transport the Kurds used. 
  The Interior Ministry told BNS the Kurds claimed to have 
arrived in Estonia Tuesday [5 April] night from Moscow in two 
groups in closed containers. They also said they paid 
go-betweens for being taken into the country. 
  The Kurds were detained on Wednesday in an apartment house 
in 
Tallinn's Kopli district. The group comprised 21 men, 16 women 
and 21 children.
