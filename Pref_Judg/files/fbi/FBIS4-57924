  [Text] Puerto Vallarta, Mexico, May 24 KYODO -- Four 
nations advanced an alternative proposal Tuesday [24 May] to a 
plan for imposing a whale sanctuary in the Antarctic that would 
virtually bar Japan and other whaling nations from resuming 
commercial whaling. 
  Chile, Argentina, Sweden and Switzerland jointly put the new 
proposal forward at a session of the International Whaling 
Commission (IWC) here, conference sources said. 
  The compromise plan appeared to stand a better chance of 
being approved than the original French-led proposal, the 
sources said. Of its joint sponsors, Chile voted against and 
Mexico for a similar sanctuary plan at last year's meeting while 
the remaining two abstained. 
  The revised plan is a scaled-back version of the drastic 
French proposal which would ban whaling in a vast area of the 
southern hemisphere that stretches from latitude 40 degrees 
south to the shores of the Antarctica, they said. 
  The fresh proposal, however, if adopted, would mandate a ban 
on any hauls of minke whales, the last large whales to have 
survived the modern whaling era, whose numbers are estimated by 
the IWC at 760,000. 
  Japan, where whale meat consumption is considered customary, 
has been calling for exclusion of minke whales from protection 
under the sanctuary formula. 
  The proposal, however, corresponds with the Japanese 
proposal 
in that it would pare down the scope of the French-proposed 
sanctuary to a narrower area that stretches from latitude 55 to 
60 degrees south to the Antarctic shores. 
  It would authorize hunting of sei whales, which make an 
annual migratory tour throughout a vast aquatic range stretching 
to the equator. Sei whales are reportedly endangered. It would 
also allow whaling in the 200-nautical-mile zone off the shores 
of Chile, one of the four proponents of the proposal.
