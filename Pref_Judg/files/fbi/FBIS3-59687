<H5>  1. Introduction </H5>
  The Power Reactor and Nuclear Fuel Development Corporation 
(PNC) constructed the Tokai Vitrification Facility (TVF) to 
vitrify high-level liquid waste (HLLW) originating from PNC's 
Tokai Reprocessing Plant into borosilicate glass, which is 
stably stored and an easily handled form, with the vitrification 
technology developed by PNC. PNC is now performing cold-test 
operations of TVF using simulated liquid waste. That HLLW 
treatment is an indispensable basic technology in nuclear fuel 
cycle, and IHI has participated in the vitrification development 
program including the remote handling technology under the 
leadership of PNC since 1979. IHI received the order to 
construct TVF in 1988, started manufacturing in June of the same 
year, and successfully completed and delivered the facility to 
PNC in April 1992. 
  This paper introduces the outline of TVF and describes IHI's 
activities during construction including the design and R&amp;D. 
  The vitrification systems of TVF and related technologies 
have been adopted for the vitrification facility of the first 
Japanese commercial reprocessing plant in Shimokita, Aomori 
prefecture, and design work is now being carried out. 
<H5>  2. Specific Features of the Facility </H5>
  TVF is the first HLLW vitrification facility in Japan. 
Specific features of the facility are as follows. 
  1. Remote maintenance system 
  Contrary to the practice common in chemical plants, a large 
part of equipment in the high-level liquid waste facility is 
installed in shielded cells, thus requiring maintenance using 
remote operation. 
  The system is characterized as follows. 
  (1) Large-size integrated cell 
  Aiming at reducing the total space required, and the number 
of remote maintenance handling equipments required for each cell 
as much as possible, a large-size integrated cell (27 meters 
long, 12 meters wide and 13 meters high) is adopted rather than 
a large number of small-size distributed cells. 
  (2) Racks for grouping equipment in the cell 
  To realize effective use of in-cell space, in view of remote 
maintenance, a variety of equipment is grouped into modules to 
be placed on racks. Depending on maintenance frequency, 
equipment is respectively predetermined for maintenance on a 
rack basis or a unit basis. The size and weight of one (1) rack 
module is about 3 meters long, 3 meters wide, 6.5 meters high 
and 15 tons. 
  2. Remote handling equipment 
  In the vitrification cell, two-arm manipulators, cranes and 
ITV (Industrial Television) system for monitoring are installed 
as remote handling equipment for operation and maintenance. 
Manipulation is performed from the control room through a 
television system. This equipment (cranes and manipulators) is 
also designed to be remotely maintained themselves by each other. 
  3. Low flow ventilation system 
  The Low Flow Ventilation System (LFV) is adopted for 
ventilating of vitrification cell. In this system, the in-cell 
air is ventilated once a day and the ventilation air is 
processed through the off-gas treatment facility of the 
vitrification process. This system reduces the amount of 
radioactive material discharged when the cell is contaminated. 
Several coolers are also installed in the cell, in order to 
control the in-cell temperature. 
  4. Process control 
  The Direct Digital Control system is adopted to control and 
monitor the process, as well as the sequence control of 
auxiliary equipments. Conventional monitoring and control panes 
with aseismic design are also installed to back up monitoring 
and control of equipment at the moment of an earthquake. 
<H5>  3. Outline of the Facility </H5>
  3.1 Process capacity of the facility 
  High-level liquid waste generated in the reprocessing of one 
(1) ton of spent fuel is processed into one (1) vitrified waste 
package of 110 kg. 
  3.2 Building of the facility 
  TVF consists of a vitrification development building, an 
administration building and a stack close to vitrification 
development building. A general view of the facility is shown in 
Figure 1 [photo not reproduced], and an aerial view of the 
interior of the vitrification cell is shown in Figure 2 [not 
reproduced].

  Main processes and equipment are arranged in the underground 
area of the vitrification development building, and various 
operation support facilities such as analysis, utility, 
radiation control, process control are arranged aboveground. In 
the administration building, utilities such as emergency 
electric generator and steam supplying equipment are installed 
on the first floor, and the second through fourth floors are 
used as offices. The stack discharges ventilated air from 
processes of the facility and building. 
<H5>  4. Outline of Processes </H5>
  Figure 3 [not reproduced] shows a block flow diagram of the 
vitrification process. 
  (1) Receiving process 
  HLLW stored in the HLLW-tank of the Tokai reprocessing plant 
is transferred to the receiving-tank in the vitrification cell 
through piping. The composition of HLLW is analyzed in the tank 
to determine the quantity of reagents to be added and 
concentration ratio. 
  (2) Pre-treatment process 
  Adjustment of composition by reagents addition and 
concentration of HLLW is performed as necessary, and the liquid 
wastes is fed continuously to the glass melting process. 
  (3) Glass melting process 
  Evaporation, calcination, and glassmelting of supplied 
liquid 
waste with glass material, are performed continuously in the 
melter. The molten glass is poured into the stainless steel 
canister. Figure 4 [photo not reproduced] shows a front view of 
the melter. 
  (4) Vitrified waste (vitrified package) handling process 
  The vitrified waste is sealed with a cap by the automatic 
welding machine after natural cooling in the cell. The vitrified 
waste is de-contaminated, and then inspected about surface 
contamination, configuration, appearance, etc. 
  (5) Liquid waste treatment process 
  The secondary liquid waste generated from each process is 
concentrated in the evaporation system. Condensed water through 
evaporating separation is transferred to the Tokai reprocessing 
plant. Concentrated liquid is returned to the receiving process 
of the facility and mixed with HLLW. 
  (6) Off-gas treatment process 
  Off-gas generated from each process is washed, adsorbed, 
filtrated in the vitrification cell, and is transferred to the 
off-gas treatment room, where the remained radioactive material 
is removed. The exhaust gas is discharged through the stack with 
being continuous monitoring. 
  (7) Vitrified waste storage process 
  The vitrified wastes are transferred to the storage cell and 
stored in the pit. 
<H5>  5. Main Process Equipment </H5>
  Main equipments of the vitrification process, including the 
melter, have been technically developed under the leadership of 
PNC with cooperation of the IHI Research Institute and other 
Divisions. Main components are as follows: 
  5.1 Melter 
  A Liquid Fed Joule-Heated Ceramic Melter (LFCM) system is 
adopted for the glass melting system. In this system, the glass 
is heated and melted directly through alternating electric 
current. The melter is constructed with refractory ceramic 
materials, covered with a stainless steel casing. 
  Specific features of the LFCM system are as follows: 
  1. Calcination and melting of liquid waste can be processed 
simultaneously, and that makes the process simple. 
  2. Uniform melting of glass under high temperatures makes a 
good quality of vitrified wastes. 
  3. The use of ceramic material and heat resisting alloy 
makes 
a long service life. 
  5.2 Off-gas treatment equipment/Liquid waste treatment 
equipment 
  (1) Wet-system for off-gas treatment is selected on the base 
of an evaluation of various equipment's performance and mock-up 
tests. 
  (2) The treatment system of volatile ruthenium generated 
from 
HLLW at high temperatures in the melter is developed after a 
behavior test and a collection test of radioactive elements. 
  (3) Continuously constant feeding of HLLW is the fundamental 
factor for quality control of vitrified waste. The two-stage 
air-lift pump feeding system is adopted. 
  5.3 Vitrified waste handling and storage equipment 
  (1) A welding machine has been developed for the cap welding 
of the vitrified package. In this machine welding operation and 
preparations such as cleaning and torch positioning are 
automatically performed. In addition to this, the machine is 
designed to allow remote maintenance. 
  (2) Aseismic performance and heat-removing characteristics 
of 
the vitrified waste storage facility have been confirmed with 
full-size test, and the results are reflected to the facility. 
<H5>  6. Remote Maintenance Design </H5>
  HLLW is such a high level of radioactivity that operators 
are 
not allowed to enter the treatment area for operation and 
maintenance. Therefore, a completely remote handling system is 
adopted for the vitrification cell to reduce radiation doses of 
operators and to increase the availability of the facility. 
Layout in the vitrification cell, performance of remote handling 
equipment, and the structure of the in-cell component are 
important factors for the design of remote maintenance. 
  6.1 Layout on in-cell component 
  In the vitrification cell, two lines of rack modules are 
arranged on both sides of the walls, and the transfer and 
maintenance area is prepared between the two rack lines at the 
center. Trial fabrication and mock-up tests for the in-cell 
component have been performed, and the results are reflected to 
the actual facility. 
  (1) Arrangement plan in the cell 
  The arrangement in the cell is designed to ensure required 
space for remote maintenance (space for approach of remote 
handling equipment, for temporary replacement, for tools, for 
observation with ITV, etc.), as well as to ensure that the 
remote handling equipment does not interfere with each other. 
  (2) Equipment arrangement in rack 
  Piping and vessels in racks are considered to be maintenance 
free or to be replaced in the whole rack. The equipment required 
for periodic replacement are designed to be remotely exchanged 
individually. Therefore, remote piping connector connecting 
in-the-rack equipments are arranged to obtain accessibility of 
crane and two-arm manipulator from the front of the rack. Racks 
including piping, vessel, were completely fabricated at IHI 
works, then delivered to the site. Figure 5 [photos not 
reproduced] shows a typical rack installation at the site. 
  (3) Penetration plug 
  In the shielding wall of the vitrification cell, the 
exchangeable penetration plugs for piping with remote connectors 
are adopted for the future changes of the process. 
  Cables in the vitrification cell are connected to the 
outside 
through exchangeable penetration plugs. Each cable inside the 
cell is also individually replaced by applying a remote cable 
connector. A small remote cable connector has been developed to 
improve remote maintainability. 
  6.2 Remote handling equipment 
  Remote maintenance at the vitrification cell is carried out 
by the operation cranes and two-arm manipulators through ITV 
monitoring. This system is different from the conventional 
maintenance method by the operation of a master-slave 
manipulator observing through shielded windows. 
  (1) ITV system 
  In case of remote maintenance using ITV system, the operator 
should have the accurate information of the location of the 
component and the remote handling equipment. Considering close 
communication between the operator of several ITV cameras and 
the operator of the two-arm manipulator watching display of TV, 
a suitable layout for the remote operation area in the control 
room is designed. Several ITV cameras are installed on walls on 
the cranes, and on the two-arm manipulators in vitrification 
cell, to monitor the whole cell. Two sets of high-definition TV 
are also adopted in an ITV system to improve monitoring. 
Radiation-hardness of ITV cameras has been verified through PNC 
R&amp;D. 
  (2) Two-arm manipulator 
  Two units of two-arm manipulators are installed. If one 
fails, the other can be used for remotely maintaining the failed 
one. The two-arm manipulator has lifting capacity up to 15 kg by 
one (1) arm, seven modes of action, and bilateral functions. The 
two-arm manipulator is mounted on the bridge and enables the 
wide range of operations inside the cell. 
<H5>  7. On Site Test </H5>
  7.1 Remote maintenance test 
  A remote maintenance operability was pre-studied during the 
design stage using a 1/10 scale model. A preliminary remote 
maintenance test was performed on the scrubber rack, the 
representative rack, and the melter rack at the mock-up test 
facility of PNC, to confirm maintainability and procedure of 
operations. Test results are reflected to all the other racks 
and components. A remote maintenance test has been finally 
carried out as on site test in the cell. Figure 6 [photos not 
reproduced] shows the remote operation test. 
  7.2 Process operation test 
  Process operation tests and unit tests have been carried out 
using water and compressed air. Then a performance test of the 
vitrification has been carried out using simulated liquid waste. 
<H5>  8. Conclusion </H5>
  We are pleased to complete successfully the construction and 
test run of TVF. New concepts and technology have been verified 
through the construction and test run of TVF. 
  We hope that the PNC will progress the test run of TVF in 
satisfactory. [sentence as published] We also intend to apply 
these experiences for future plant construction and other fields.
