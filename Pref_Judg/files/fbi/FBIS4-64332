<F P=106> [Unattributed report: "95,000 Tonnes of Nuclear Waste Have </F>
Been Dumped Into the Seas"] 
  [Text] According to the Social Democratic Party of Germany 
[SPD], approximately 95,000 tonnes of nuclear waste have been 
dumped into the world seas. 
  This was announced by the environmental spokesman of the SPD 
Bundestag group, Michael Mueller. The Federal Government dealt 
with a corresponding inquiry by the SPD late in the evening 
yesterday. 
  "Military enterprises are the main culprits," particularly 
in 
former USSR, but also in Western countries, Mueller stressed. 
  Mueller called for a worldwide agreement against dumping 
nuclear material and a ban on nuclear-powered submarines. 
  The member of the Christian Democratic Union, Klaus Harries, 
suggested controls on draining radioactive waste water from the 
reprocessing plants in Sellafield (Great Britain) and La Haque 
(France). 
  The Federal Government sees no need to speak of a "general 
contamination of the world seas" because of the dumping of 
radioactive waste resulting from the civilian and military use 
of nuclear energy. The European coastal waters (North Sea and 
Baltic Sea) are not directly endangered.
