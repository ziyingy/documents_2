  [Editorial Report] Moscow Radio Rossii Network in Russian 
at 1800 GMT on 4 January broadcasts a 2-minute report by station 
correspondent Valentina Bochkova from Riga on the visit by a 
Danish delegation, headed by Danish Defense Minister Hans 
Haekkerup, to the Russian military base at Skrunda in Latvia. 
Bochkova speaks about the increasing interest in this space 
vehicle tracking station and the fact that the withdrawal of 
Russian troops from Latvia depends on the fate of this station. 
She says that this station processes information on 15,000 
space movements every day. It is an automatic tracking station 
serviced by at least 450 people, according to the Russian 
military. The personnel work in complete safety, as neither 
chemical nor radioactive substances are used as sources of 
energy. There have not been any accidents or cases of receiving 
incorrect information since the space observation station 
started operating in the 1960s. The center is one of the links 
in Russia's anti-missile defense system, Bochkova says.
