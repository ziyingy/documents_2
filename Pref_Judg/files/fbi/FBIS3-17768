  [Text] Russia will supply 2.5 Mn tons of crude oil to Cuba 
in exchange for one million tons of sugar cane for federal use. 
  Under a Russian government ordinance of March 25, 1.5 Mn 
tons 
of this amount will be allocated from the export resources for 
countries outside the former Soviet Union and the remaining 1 Mn 
tons by reducing the amounts to be supplied to former Soviet 
republics by the Roskontrakt corporation. 
  The state customer of the Cuban deliveries is the Foreign 
Trade Ministry which will determine the actual suppliers 
shortly. The supplies will be financed from extra-budgetary 
sources. 
  Meanwhile, the total amount of oil to be exported for 
federal 
needs will be increased by 1 Mn tons to a total of 26 Mn tons in 
1994.
