  [Text] The Agency of International Science and Technology's 
[AIST] Electrotechnical Laboratory (Sotaro Tomiyama, Laboratory 
Chief) established technology to directly observe atoms and 
molecules inside a vacuum. This technology uses laser radiation 
to ionize atoms and molecules, which exist in very small amounts 
in a vacuum, so that the distribution of atoms and molecules in 
space can be detected by imagery. This is the world's first such 
detection device. Combined with ``atom counting'' technology, 
this device enables the counting of atoms one by one. This makes 
it possible to measure the molecular density in an ultrahigh 
vacuum which, up until this time, has been impossible. They 
believe they can play a role in the development of new 
functional elements, recording elements, and information 
elements--the results of atomcraft, which builds up atoms one on 
top of the other. 
  This technology is one of the achievements of a project 
called ``the study related to ultrahigh vacuum generation, 
measurement, and utilization'' using science and technology 
promotion funds. This is a pioneering success by the surface 
control research laboratory of the ETL's ultimate technology 
department. This laboratory has been taking on the challenge of 
creating technology to count gaseous molecules and atoms one by 
one. 
  At present, the technology has advanced to a point where it 
can create an ultrahigh vacuum with a pressure of 
10[.sup]-11[/] pascals, which is that of the environment of 
an artificial satellite in geostationary orbit in space. This 
means that the number of molecules per cubic centimeter is about 
1,000. Therefore, it is necessary to measure precisely an 
ultrahigh vacuum in this state. In particular, it is essential 
to know the absolute number of molecules (gaseous molecular 
density) for the manipulation of molecules and atoms in the 
submicron world. 
  For that reason, it is essential to have the technology to 
know the volume of the space and to detect 100 percent of the 
atoms and molecules in the space. The laboratory has already 
ionized atoms and molecules by striking them with a laser 
radiation-source and established technology for counting the 
generated ions. However, this technology could only count the 
number of atoms and molecules, and could not know the volume of 
space in which the ions were being generated, so it was not 
possible to measure the density (the number of atoms per unit 
space). 
  The developed technology is a detection system that can 
directly observe the ionization sphere made by the laser 
radiation source. It is the first technology to make it possible 
to observe, by video imagery, the ion generation sphere. 
  The laser used for ionization is a picosecond pulse YAG 
laser 
operatingat the second harmonic generation level (wavelength of 
532 nanometers and pulse width of 35 picoseconds). This laser 
radiation was focused into the vacuum by a lens and 100 percent 
of the atoms and molecules [within the focal area] were ionized 
by it. The laboratory has succeeded in directly measuring 
hydrogen molecules within an ultrahigh vacuum.
