  [Text] Recently, the Nanhai City Public Security Bureau 
succeeded in intercepting 99 stowaways attempting to enter 
Japan, all of whom came from Changle County, Fujian. From 13 to 
15 April, they arrived and lived in the city's Guicheng 
Banyuedao Tourism Area in batches and were prepared to illegally 
emigrate together to Japan organized by snakeheads [people 
smugglers] from Guangzhou and Fujian. 
  After a tip off, and with the support of the Foshan City 
Public Security Bureau, Nanhai City Public Security Bureau 
dispatched a large number of police personnel to the area to 
patrol and investigate, and the 99 stowaways were all captured. 
The police personnel seized two machetes and five daggers at 
the spot. 
  Fujian police dispatched personnel yesterday to Nanhai City 
to pick up the 99 stowaways for further handling in Fujian. A 
search for the snakeheads is underway.
