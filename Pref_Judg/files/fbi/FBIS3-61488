  [Abstract] On the basis of a wide range of of data the 
author constructs a stochastic classification model for the 
characteristics of the empirical distributions of fields of 
various types. As experimental material he uses 15 samples from 
surveys of ocean temperature fields obtained on expeditions by 
research ships of the Academy of Sciences of the USSR in various 
dynamic zones of the Atlantic Ocean and the Mediterranean. 
  By means of the criterion X[.sup]2[/] algorithms were 
constructed for the optimal classification of empirical 
histograms according to general populations. Using the results 
of the measurements an analysis was made of the general 
populations of horizontal l[.sup]+[/][.sub]-[/] scales for 
temperature fields in the upper layer of the ocean.
