  [Excerpt] The privatization of 86,000 state-run companies 
and the opening of foreign trade will make Russia a nation of 
major trade possibilities for Mexico. Nikolai Zaitzev, a Russian 
trade official in Mexico, has invited the Monterrey businessmen 
who attended the 33d Regular Assembly of the National Council of 
Foreign Trade of the Northeast to invest or trade with his 
country. 
  The Russian diplomat said Mexico had exported to Russia 
during 1993 between $45 million to $50 million, an amount he 
considered as low. "Besides, the majority of these exports 
reached Russia via third nations, such as Belgium," he said. 
  Among the Mexican exports to Russia are steel pipes and 
cigars, a product which the Monterrey company Cigarrera La 
Moderna exported last year for $5 million. "Mexico only exports 
between $5 million and $7 million, a figure which is very low," 
Zaitzev said. [passage omitted].
