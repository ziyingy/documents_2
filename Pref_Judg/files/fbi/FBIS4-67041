  [Text] Minutes before leaving for Costa Rica, President 
Cesar Gaviria held a news conference to reiterate his position 
on holding a plebiscite to ensure that the people will decide 
whether to accept or reject the legalization of drugs. Jorge 
Enrique Botero has the story: 
  [Begin recording] [Gaviria] The government is more convinced 
about the possibility of holding a plebiscite. 
  [Botero] Gaviria unexpectedly commented on the decision by 
the country's highest constitutional organization. 
  [Gaviria] Congress or the people should have discussed, 
analyzed, and voted on a decision such as this one; it should 
not have been a court decision. 
  [Botero] Gaviria said he will seek counsel to initiate the 
plebiscite process. 
  [Gaviria] We will have to decide along with the Electoral 
Tribunal and the National Civil Registry Office when to hold the 
plebiscite. 
  [Botero] The president added it is unlikely the consultation 
will be made during the 29 May presidential elections, but he 
hinted of a possible plebiscite during the runoff elections, 
should they be necessary. [end recording]
