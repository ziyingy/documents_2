<F P=106> [Article by Pierre Langereux: "France Preparing Experimental </F>
Telecommunications Satellite for 1988"] 
  [Text] The "Sillard report" recommends the construction of 
a small 1.5-t experimental satellite to test the active antennas 
and an on-board Ku-band switching system as well as a plasma 
power plant running on xenon, AsGa photobatteries, and 
Ni-H[.sub]2[/] batteries. 
  In the exclusive interview recently given to AIR &amp; 
COSMOS, 
Gerard Longuet, French Minister of Industry, Post and 
Telecommunications and of Foreign Trade, announced that the 
project for the construction of an experimental 
telecommunications satellite, as recommended in the report 
forwarded to him by Yves Sillard in December, "is getting my 
approval" (cf., A&amp;C, No. 1543). And, as the former 
delegate-general for armament recommends, the French minister is 
in favor of the Europeanization of the project which, in his 
opinion, links the three main French companies concerned: 
Alcatel Espace, Aerospatiale, and Matra Marconi Space (MMS). All 
that remains to be done now is to find ways of financing the 
satellite against the background of the current economic 
situation; according to the report, the satellite could be built 
for a price tag of between Fr2.5 to 2.8 billion and could be 
launched by Ariane by mid-1998. 
  The Sillard report emphasizes the need for rapidly embarking 
on this technological program in order to support French 
industry both regarding launch vehicles and payloads in 
telecommunications "against the background of the major effort 
undertaken by the United States and Japan." France is already 
seriously behind in this field, while Japan is getting ready to 
launch an ambitious technological satellite, the ETS-6, this 
year with a new rocket, the H2; and the United States is about 
to orbit its experimental satellite, the ACTS. 
  Among the various possible space telecommunications 
missions, 
the Sillard team decided to give priority to experimentation in 
a stationary earth orbit (the more classical one) which involves 
"the most important medium-term stakes for our industry." The 
CNES [National Center for Space Studies], by the way, had 
already launched a modest effort in the field of low-orbit 
radio-forwarding satellites with the Taos project (the old S70) 
in which Aerospatiale and Matra Marconi Space (MMS) are 
associated. 
<H5>  New Technologies </H5>
  However, considering both the rather limited financial 
resources on the national level and the urgency of checking out 
the key technologies in flight--technologies which French 
industry will really need between now and the end of the 
decade--the Sillard report prefers to make a "realistic" 
recommendation. This involves a small satellite that is to test 
a Ku-band payload consisting of "active" electronic antennas and 
on-board switching produced by Alcatel Espace with--for the 
first time in Europe--a plasma-powered electric propulsion 
system using the motors developed in cooperation with the 
Russian firm of Fakel through SEP [European Propulsion Company] 
(cf., A&amp;C, No. 1434). All of this is to be mounted on a mixed 
platform which--and this is rather exceptional--would be built 
jointly by Aerospatiale and Matra Marconi Space , by 
hybridization of their Eurostar Spacebus 1000 "triaxial" launch 
platforms. 
  The proposed experimental satellite would use this mixed 
platform featuring a modular architecture made with an 
aluminum-carbon sandwich (with a new fiber) and lighter wiring 
(using aluminum wires and subminiaturized connectors). The 
structure is made up of flat panels connected to a central tube 
enclosing the two tanks (pressurized with helium) of the 
(chemical) two-fuel propulsion system. It would serve both for 
orbital transfer and control with a 400-N motor and for triaxial 
attitude control of the satellite with small 10-N boosters 
which, if necessary, would in particular ensure North-South 
stabilization; in other words, in case the experimental plasma 
propulsion system (using xenon) with its two SEP Mk2 motors 
should fail. Triaxial attitude control (at close to 0.05ë), 
also using a kinetic wheel with magnetic bearings and a new 
technique for shifting the satellite's center of gravity (by 
orienting the solar panels), as well as an autonomous navigation 
system using the Navstar/GPS satellites. 
  The platform will furthermore be equipped with autonomous 
on-board management with a central-type 1750 computer (with 
remotely chargeable software) linked by a large-volume busbar to 
the peripherals of the payload and the servo units: command, 
power supply, stabilization, and heat control. For the platform, 
it will employ the passive, paint-based technique, insulation 
coatings, preheaters and optical reflectors (OSR) with active 
means for the payload: fluid loops with capillary pumping for 
the active antennas and heat conductors with constant 
conductance coupled to deployable radiators. Electric power 
supply will come through a lightweight solar generator (GSR-3 
type) with two deployable wings, each having two airfoils: one 
with Si photobatteries and the other one with AsGa cells (on a 
Ge substrate). Oriented by electrical motors, the panels will be 
deployed entirely from the transfer orbit and will supply 1.6 kW 
for their service life which is three years. The circuit will be 
permanently regulated by means of class 100-Ah nickel-hydrogen 
(Ni-H[.sub]2[/]) batteries. 
  The experimental payload will consist of two active Ku-band 
antennas: one for broadcasting and the other one for receiving, 
comprising, respectively, 46 and 32 modules distributed over 
900mm or 600mm square panels. On the Europe (and with 
reconfiguration via remote control from the ground), each plate 
antenna will be able to make up four 12-14-GHz beams. They are 
connected to three repeaters with progressive-wave tubes: one 
with filter switching (SAW) in the two 36-MHz channels and the 
other one with wide-band transparent repeater and TOP of 100 W; 
the latter is a regenerative repeater associated with the signal 
processing system by on-board computer with microprocessor 
(OBP). Two options are contemplated for this equipment: either a 
small version (with 4x33 MBits) of the "civilian" OBP developed 
within the context of ESA (which is looking for a satellite for 
in-flight testing), or the "military" OBP (with coding and 
anti-jamming devices) developed by DGA [General Delegation for 
Weapons]. 
<H5>  1.5-t Satellite </H5>
  According to the report, experimentation would be possible 
with a payload of around 220 kg onboard a 600-kg platform and 
with a fuel reserve of 680 kg; that would correspond to a small 
satellite of only 1,500 kg. It could be launched by an Ariane (4 
or 5) rocket at the latest during the first quarter of 1998 if 
the program were to be started in January 1994! 
  On that basis the Sillard team is preparing "a proposal for 
a 
balanced program with a realistic scope" which "would satisfy 
the essential points of the priority objectives established by 
the manufacturers." All of this would be done within an 
acceptable financing context on the national (or European) level 
with an estimated budget on the order of Fr2.5-2.8 billion 
(depending on the type of OBP) for a complete 1.5-t satellite 
(platform and payload) and its launch estimated (with a double 
shot using Ariane) at only Fr300 million. The report also 
studied but did not recommend a more ambitious option (with 
experimentation of equipment using L and Ka bands) with the help 
of a 2.5-t satellite that would cost Fr4.2 billion (including 
launch). In both cases, the cost of the operation would 
essentially (to the extent of three-quarters) be taken care of 
by CNES; the rest would be shared between industry, France 
Telecom and DGA. 
  As he told AIR &amp; COSMOS, the Minister of Industry has 
picked 
the low option, that is, the 1.5-t satellite. But he did so 
without wishing to go into any further detail regarding the 
financing, except to confirm that "the major portion" would, as 
a matter of fact, be financed through CNES. He alerted us, 
however, that it appears "difficult this year to earmark any 
funds for the operation" which he would, however, like to start 
by the end of 1994. Gerard Longuet would like particularly to be 
able to submit the project to Matignon [Office of the Prime 
Minister] in the spring on the basis of the case folder which 
the CNES will have prepared in the meantime. 
  According to the Sillard report, project management--which 
would accommodate both civilian and military concerns--should be 
handled by a program committee reporting to the oversight 
ministries (Industry and Defense) and directing the government 
project team which would link France Telecom and DGA under the 
chairmanship of CNES. On the industry side, the project 
executive team--for the first time uniting the three French 
builders as co-subcontractors--would also be run by a committee 
with a rotating chairmanship (to be handled during the first 
year by Alcatel Espace). The project manager (from Matra Marconi 
Space) would be assisted by two deputies, one (from 
Aerospatiale) for the platform, and the other one (from Alcatel 
Espace) for the payload. The satellite would first of all be 
built in Toulouse (by Matra) and it would then be assembled at 
Cannes (by Aerospatiale). Of course, the actual manufacturing 
job would draw heavily on French equipment makers, such as 
Dassault Eletronique (rapid numerical processing on 
hyperfrequency, electronic scanning antennas), Sagem [General 
Electricity and Mechanics Applications Company] (inertial 
sensors), Sextant (power distribution and control), Sodern 
(optical sensors), SAFT [Company for Fixed and Traction Storage 
Batteries] (batteries), SEP (solar panel orientation motors, 
plasma engine), Thomson (components, TOP), etc. 
  However, "in an effort to be wide open and competitive," it 
would also be desirable "to get foreign industrialists involved 
in those particular areas where they are the habitual partners 
of French firms," the report emphasized. It was noted that this 
might involve firms in Germany (DASA [German Aerospace 
Company]), Belgium (ETCA), or Britain (MMS-UK). 
  Longuet adopted this recommendation; he hoped that "France 
will retain its role as major project organizer" and noted that 
"the project must from the very beginning be wide open to 
European participation!"

<H5>  [Box, p 41] </H5>
<H5>  Limited Experimentation </H5>
  The Sillard report strongly recommends that France build an 
experimental telecommunications satellite. But it did so 
anticipating the (very real) budget constraints that persuaded 
it to propose a "realistic" and, hence, "minimal" solution. 
Specifically, this would involve a "little" satellite weighing 
only 1.5-t, at a price tag of Fr2.5 billion, not the (perhaps 
entirely too?) ambitious project--which one might have expected 
in the old days--calling for a more complete satellite (with 
experimentation also in the L and Ka bands, in addition to one 
in Ku band that was picked) and whose cost would be Fr4.2 
billion. 
  But is it really too much for France, and above all for 
Europe, to afford (not even once per decade) some 
experimentation for the coming missions (on the L and Ka bands)? 
Especially on a satellite that would be launched in 1998, but 
whose first technological check-out phase would not end until 
2001! 
  In the meantime, Japan--not to mention the United 
States--will this year launch a huge 3.8-t takeoff weight 
experimental satellite (2 t in a stationary earth orbit), using 
its new H2 rocket. This ETS-6 should test mobile communications 
at 2.5 GHz, and fixed services at 20-30 and 38-43 GHz, as well 
as optical inter-satellite links (via laser) at 0.5-0.8 microns 
and radio at 2 and 23-32 GHz. But that would also include a 
plasma engine running on xenon. All of that is starting in 1994. 
  On top of that, another experimental satellite of the same 
size, the COMETS, is already being built. It will test 
interactive TV and interorbital links at 22-27 GHz and mobile 
links at 20-30 and 40-50 GHz. That satellite should be launched 
in 1997-1998, again using the H2 rocket, around the same time as 
the little French 12-14-GHz satellite. "Under these conditions, 
who will be among the world space telecommunications leaders by 
the year 2000?" asks Pierre Langereux.
