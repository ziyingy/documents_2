  [Text] There were violent incidents in all the cities of 
the territories following the battle in Hebron yesterday. 
Dozens of Palestinians were injured and the IDF [Israel Defense 
Forces] clamped a curfew on Nabulus and its environs. A general 
commercial strike was declared in the territories. Our 
correspondent Rina Matzliah sums up today's incidents: 
  The territories resembled today the early days of the 
intifadah. Serious stone-throwing incidents occurred downtown 
Nabulus today. The IDF unsuccessfully tried to disperse the 
rioters with tear gas. Approximately 17 Nabulus youths were 
wounded by IDF gunfire. A border policeman was slightly 
wounded. The IDF imposed a curfew on the city and nearby 
refugee camps. 
  There were also disturbances in Ramallah and al-Duhayshah 
today. Sixteen youths were wounded by IDF gunfire in the 
Jabalyah refugee camp in the Gaza Strip. Another four were 
wounded in the al-Burayj and al-Nusayrat refugee camps. The 
youths are at the vanguard of today's violent confrontation, 
which is depicted as a struggle of solidarity with the residents 
of Hebron.
