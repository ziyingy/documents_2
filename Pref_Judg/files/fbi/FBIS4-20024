<F P=106> [Interview with Prime Minister John Major by Bernd Doerler </F>
and Olaf Ihlau in London; date not given: "We Determine 
Europe's Direction"] 
  [Text] [DER SPIEGEL] Mr. Prime Minister, are you governing 
an isolated, mediocre, and small nation? 
  [Major] We are not isolated, mediocre, and small. We never 
have been and never will be. 
  [DER SPIEGEL] We are quoting the Archbishop of Canterbury 
George Carey. He has painted a rather gloomy picture of the 
state of Britain. 
  [Major] We have always been an globally-oriented countyy. No 
other country has invested more money abroad per capita than 
Great Britain. Only a few countries are so widely involved in 
foreign trade as we. 
  [DER SPIEGEL] The spiritual head of the Church of England 
says that the biased promotion of the private sector and the 
brusque decline of the public sector have divided the nation and 
created an impoverished underclass -- a direct attack on 
Thatcherism and Majorism. 
  [Major] I know the archbishop very well. I do not think he 
meant that. Net income has gone up in every social class over 
the past 15 years. People are increasingly well off, even when 
one considers inflation. 
  [DER SPIEGEL] Not everyone, surely. Poverty is growing in 
your country. Take a look at the thousands of young homeless 
people on the streets of London. 
  [Major] They do not have to be on the streets. There is 
enough accommodation in London and other regions for them, but 
they simply do not want it. For many of them it is a question 
of culture. Some people make a conscious decision to live 
lonely lives. 
  [DER SPIEGEL] Has Archbishop Carey's description of Britain 
anything to do with the country's loose relations with Europe, 
which over the past 31 years have made life difficult for eight 
prime ministers? 
  [Major] There is nothing to say about Great Britain's 
relationship with Europe. Just like every other European Union 
[EU] country, we have our own ideas about what is right for the 
EU, not because we have a British point of view but because we 
have a European one. 
  [DER SPIEGEL] Could you give an example? 
  [Major] Why did I refuse to ratify the social clause in 
Maastricht? Because I believe the provisions of Maastricht make 
it more difficult for unemployed Europeans to find a job, and 
those who do have a job will lose it all the sooner. The 
reason: Wages in Europe are higher than among our overseas 
competitors the United States, Japan, or the countries of the 
Pacific region. 
  [DER SPIEGEL] Unemployment in Europe is approaching the 20 
million mark. 
  [Major] Great Britain is the only major country in which 
unemployment is falling. One reason for this is that we have 
reached the next phase of the economic cycle. But our social 
costs are also lower than in the rest of Europe. Manpower is 
cheaper here, therefore there are higher investments, and 
employers are more willing to hire new people. 
  That is why I did not accept the Maastricht social clause. 
My arguments apply to the whole of Europe, and are not just a 
British oddity. 
  [DER SPIEGEL] Nevertheless one does not have the impression 
that Great Britain lies "in the heart of Europe" as you would 
like it to do. 
  [Major] What does "in the heart of Europe" mean? I have no 
intention of adhering to some EU fads if I am not convinced they 
are correct. Being in the heart of Europe means being able 
jointly to determine the rate of change. 
  [DER SPIEGEL] In which spheres have you implemented this 
right to joint determination? 
  [Major] In the expansion of the EU, made possible through 
the alliance between Germany and Great Britain. After all, I 
can also claim to occupy a good position in matters concerning 
social guidelines and the principle of subsidiary; in this 
sphere, too, we and Germany have reversed the trend toward 
centralization. One quarter of EU legislation will either be 
abolished or reworded. We have pushed through our desires to a 
major extent also concerning the shape of the European budget 
until the end of the century. 
  Being in the middle of Europe does not mean competing 
against 
our EU partners to see who enjoys the greatest popularity. It 
means having a clear view of what should happen. We indeed 
determine Europe's direction. 
  [DER SPIEGEL] The Euroskeptics in your party still think 
Britain's real strength lies in isolation from the continent. 
  [Major] That is simply wrong. Only a tiny minority would 
prefer it if we did not belong to the EU. Most of the skeptics 
fear that we are letting ourselves become enmeshed in a 
centralized Europe, which they do not find attractive. But the 
overwhelming majority of Conservatives believe that Britain's 
place is in Europe, and they want us to play an increasing role 
in creating the kind if Europe that will emerge in the nearest 
future. 
  In case anyone doubts our commitment, let me tell him that 
my 
government has fought more political battles concerning the 
Maastricht treaty than the rest of Europe. 
  [DER SPIEGEL] But you yourself succumbed to an anti-European 
chauvinism when you and your EU partners started the dispute 
about blocking minorities and veto rights in the Council of 
Ministers. 
  [Major] No. If it is such a good idea to have a firm 
majority in order to implement resolutions, why was there such 
strong agreement with Germany and other countries that we should 
reform this system in 1996? 
  [DER SPIEGEL] The forthcoming government conference is meant 
to discuss institutional reforms in order to make the EU more 
efficient and better able to reach decisions. 
  [Major] We are already opposed to a new majority vote, 
without waiting for 1996. One reason is that the Brussels 
Commission is trying, by means of Article 18 that deals with 
labor and trade union issues, to introduce the social charter 
through the back door. 
  If we were to increase the blocking minority in the Council 
of Ministers to 27 votes without seeking approval, in the coming 
months we would receive a whole series of decrees that are 
unacceptable to the British Parliament. I could not accept 
that. Not until we had been assured that there would be no 
further resolutions that would increase unemployment in this 
country did I grant my consent. 
  [DER SPIEGEL] If an association were to grow by 33 
percent, not even the International Cricket Conference, the 
governing body for your favorite sport, would avoid adopting a 
suitably modified veto right. 
  [Major] To adhere to your metaphor, when someone belongs to 
a club, is it not obvious that he should obey its rules? I will 
tell you what upsets me the most. Whenever necessary, Germany, 
France, Spain, and Italy defend anything they consider a matter 
of national interests, but no one accuses them of being 
anti-European when they do so. 
  [DER SPIEGEL] That is good, is it not? How do you explain 
it? 
  [Major] You should explain, not I. To be frank, I do not 
accept the empty accusation of us being anti-Europeans every 
time we hold a different stance to the one that is currently in 
fashion in the EU. 
  [DER SPIEGEL] On the continent, people still have the 
impression that Great Britain does not have its heart in the EU, 
and that it is merely interested in a more advantageous free 
trade zone. 
  [Major] That is wrong, and always has been. It might apply 
to a handful of people, but not to our government policy. 
  [DER SPIEGEL] Perhaps the dispute about the blocking 
minority also has something to do with British fears of being 
involved in a German-dominated Europe or in a Franco-German 
European core. 
  [Major] That is nonsense. I have no fear of being 
imprisoned in a German-dominated united Europe, as you put it. 
The stances of Germany and Britain are similar on many topics, 
for instance on the subject of subsidiarity and an expansion of 
the EU. There has been complete accord between us on these 
important topics recently. 
  [DER SPIEGEL] London and Bonn also seem to share the biggest 
doubts about the European Monetary Union [EMU] . 
  [Major] My skepticism is based on the expected economic 
outcome of the EMU. Let us assume that the EMU comes into 
operation in 1997, 1998, or 1999, as planned. If we then have a 
common currency and want to be successful, all European economic 
mechanisms must be more efficient and linked more closely by 
then. But I do not know anyone who thinks even an approximation 
of the EMU can be achieved. Therefore there is not going to be 
an EMU. 
  [DER SPIEGEL] So you are declaring the EMU defunct? 
  [Major] Even when we were still negotiating Maastricht, I 
said Europe would not be ready for a single currency in 1999. I 
was not displaying British chauvinism, merely economic judgment. 
I am still sure I am right. 
  [DER SPIEGEL] Do you think it is time to set greater 
emphasis 
on national identity once again? 
  [Major] National identity has never been erased. There are 
areas where one can pool national claims. There would then be a 
veto in security matters, in order to protect spheres of 
national interests. The remainder of the EU would not interfere 
with these. That is how the whole thing works. 
  [DER SPIEGEL] Obviously, more things join the United Kingdom 
and Germany than divide them. But how do you explain the 
increasing discord in this partnership? 
  [Major] I see no political differences between the 
governments. 
  [DER SPIEGEL] Was that just an invention of the media? 
  [Major] Obviously your information is based on the results 
of the latest opinion poll whereby the British and Germans do 
not trust each other so much. 
  [DER SPIEGEL] According to this poll, the British and 
Germans have less trust in each other than in the case of the 
Americans and Japanese. 
  [Major] That was a rather irrelevant question. Whenever I 
am in the company of British and Germans, there is consensus on 
most issues. 
  [DER SPIEGEL] But you cannot deny that Britain fears a 
Germany that determines the balance of power in the center of 
Europe. 
  [Major] Yes, I can. In any case, I have no such fear. 
  [DER SPIEGEL] But your predecessor, Margaret Thatcher, did. 
  [Major] I cannot speak for her. When German unification 
occurred, I considered this event historically inevitable. We 
welcomed it, and were right to do so. Chancellor Kohl had no 
choice but to push the unification process through. 
  [DER SPIEGEL] In that case, how do you explain all the 
anti-German remarks and cartoons in parts of the British press? 
  [Major] I cannot speak on behalf of the British press. 
  [DER SPIEGEL] There are also differences of opinion 
concerning the forthcoming celebrations of the 50th anniversary 
of D-Day. Chancellor Kohl would like to attend a ceremony of 
reconciliation. 
  [Major] As far as I know, Helmut never wanted to be involved 
in these celebrations. Next year, on the 50th anniversary of 
the end of the war, there will be joint appearances and 
ceremonies of reconciliation. Germany will take part then. But 
this is not up to me. This is something that has to be 
discussed with a lot of people and organizations. 
  [DER SPIEGEL] You are meeting Chancellor Kohl this week. 
Should the debate on basic EU principles--scheduled for 
1996--not cover European security and military policy as well? 
  [Major] The chancellor and I have met many times. Our 
meetings are free and uninhibited. We will probably hold most 
of our talks during a walk at my country seat, Chequers. 
  [DER SPIEGEL] Perhaps you will take Kohl to the sauna for 
some sweating, like Boris Yeltsin? 
  [Major] I have no sauna at Chequers, unfortunately. We will 
certainly also discuss what plans Germany has for its EU 
presidency in the second half of 1994. That will be a major 
topic. 
  [DER SPIEGEL] Kohl has already said that he will cooperate 
with the French very closely. They will take over the EU 
presidency after Germany. 
  [Major] I hope he cooperates closely with all partners. 
  [DER SPIEGEL] There is little trace of joint West European 
action in the Balkans. Why has the EU failed in Bosnia? 
  [Major] I think the EU did act jointly, but it happened 
under the auspices of the United Nations. 
  [DER SPIEGEL] Now and then, concerning, for example, the 
dispute on the acceptance of Slovenia and Croatia, it looks as 
if West Europe has reverted to the old patterns of mistrust that 
existed at the beginning of this century. 
  [Major] At the beginning of the civil war in Bosnia there 
were only three options: to remain completely outside the 
conflict and let the warring sides simply do what they wanted. 
The second option would have meant that the Western democracies 
stop the war in former Yugoslavia. 
  [DER SPIEGEL] And attack with their forces. 
  [Major] Do you know what would have happened then? A war 
has never been won with the sole use of air power. Even in Iraq, 
it was the ground forces that determined the outcome. Down in 
the Balkans we are dealing with 200,000 armed Serbs, Croats, and 
Bosnians, who are fighting in hilly terrain. How many NATO 
troops would we have to deploy in order to end the fighting? 
The military reckon 400,000 or more would be needed today. 
  [DER SPIEGEL] Today, perhaps. But nothing like that number 
would have been needed if the West had undertaken action two 
years ago. 
  [Major] No, no. This figure was established already at the 
beginning of the civil war, 400,000 soldiers. Where were they 
supposed to come from? 
  [DER SPIEGEL] Certainly not from Germany. 
  [Major] I know that. But not from other countries, either. 
The truth is that we cannot deploy 400,000 soldiers. We British 
have sent troops on humanitarian missions. And that was the 
third option -- to steer a solution and in the meantime do 
everything possible to step up humanitarian aid. 
  [DER SPIEGEL] And what is the result of this policy in 
Bosnia today? The Serbs have been able to attain their 
territorial objectives, and a peace treaty to cement these gains 
would also sanction ethnic expulsion. 
  [Major] Are you asking questions, or do you wish to discuss 
things with me? 
  [DER SPIEGEL] Both. 
  [Major] We do not know how matters will end yet. It is 
obvious that the boundaries must be redrawn. Everyone should 
now discuss this. And if you insist that troops should have 
been sent in, I would certainly like to know where these troops 
were supposed to have come from. 
  [DER SPIEGEL] If the Serbian aggressors extend their ethnic 
conflict to Kosovo and Macedonia, I do not suppose you will 
attack either. 
  [Major] We will deal with this matter when it happens. But 
in any case, I am not going to sit and argue with you about what 
we are going to do. In any case, it has not yet happened. One 
reason for this is the presence of United Nations units there. 
  [DER SPIEGEL] What sort of involvement in the Balkan 
conflict do you expect from the Germans, with their 
constitutional restraints and historical burden? 
  [Major] The Germans have assumed a great burden in this war. 
One cannot underestimate the financial costs they have incurred 
by accepting Balkan refugees. That is an extraordinary 
commitment and a highly conspicuous contribution. 
  [DER SPIEGEL] Mr. Prime Minister, in the wake of all the 
Euroturbulence, your leadership qualities are once again under 
fire, especially within your own party. Is it a consolation to 
you that right now most European government leaders are losing 
their electorates because of the economic recession and social 
misery? 
  [Major] Quite so. All over Europe, even in Great Britain, 
people feel bitter about their politicians right now. This is 
mainly because of the recession, which has proved longer and 
more severe than we thought. All the rows in European 
parliaments about European policy have only made this miserable 
mood even more miserable. 
  [DER SPIEGEL] Right now you have one thing in common with 
Chancellor Kohl -- bad popularity ratings. What do you say to 
those who claim that neither of you will be in office by the end 
of the year? 
  [Major] I have a lot to do and no time to indulge in such 
speculation. But let me recall the period before the last 
elections. Everyone was convinced I would not win. That was 
two years ago, and I expect to be able to answer your questions 
for some time yet. 
  [DER SPIEGEL] You are fond of saying that politics is a 
rough business. But you would rather go yourself than be thrown 
out of office? 
  [Major] I will go when people least expect it. Until then I 
still have a lot to take care of. 
  [DER SPIEGEL] Thank you for the interview, Mr. Prime 
Minister.
