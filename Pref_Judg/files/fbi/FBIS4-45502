<F P=106> [Article signed IN/HF/BN: "UN Conference on Money </F>
Laundering and Legalization of Soft Drugs -- Iran Criticizes 
Swiss Policy"] 
  [Text] Courmayeur, 20 Jun (ATS) -- A UN conference on money 
laundering ruled out the liberalization of soft drugs. The head 
of the Iranian delegation criticized the Swiss and the 
Netherlands policies on this issue. 
  Luciano Violante, vice president of the Italian Parliament, 
had proposed to liberalize soft drugs like hashish. Such a 
measure, he said, would facilitate the fight against the mafia. 
Argentine's Adolfo Beria, president of the UN Council for the 
fight against crime, explained that the conference had rejected 
this proposal. 
  "In the name of Allah," the Iranian delegate, Mehdi 
Mirafzai, 
strongly condemned any liberalization. He expressed his deep 
concern over the ongoing legalization processes in several 
countries, particularly in Switzerland and in the Netherlands. 
He called for a survey which should assess the effects of the 
liberalization of drugs on the fight against money laundering.
