  [Text] Several Israeli institutions recently purchased 
sophisticated American computers with a capacity equivalent to 
that of a supercomputer, which the U.S. Defense Department has 
banned from being exported to Israel. 
  The United States restricts exports of fast supercomputers 
to 
many countries, especially those who have not signed the Nuclear 
Nonproliferation Treaty. But a new development by the U.S. firm 
Mips [as transliterated] and the Japanese firm Toshiba enhances 
the performance of medium-size computers, which can be exported 
to Israel, to the level of a very fast supercomputer, which 
cannot be exported to Israel. 
  The new development provides the computer with a processing 
capacity of 300 million instructions per second. In fact, it is 
a flexible computer which can operate on one array of chips, 
which does not require a special export license, but to which an 
additional array of chips can be added. A computer with three 
arrays of chips requires a special license since it attains the 
processing power of a supercomputer. In principle, even five 
such arrays of chips can be added to the computer.
