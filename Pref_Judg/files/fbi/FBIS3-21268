  The development of various nuclear systems, including 
nuclear 
fusion systems, involves a variety of issues concerning 
materials. The basic issues that are common to all of them, 
however, are the analysis of various phenomena involving 
radioactivity, and the creation of materials that are resistant 
to deterioration caused by radiation. There are a number of 
methods for conducting irradiation experiments on materials. 
These include electron irradiation, ion irradiation, and nuclear 
fission reactor or nuclear spallation neutron irradiation, but 
research on neutron irradiation is of particular importance. 
Because neutrons generate activation, there are a number of 
restrictions and barriers to the establishment of remote-control 
experiment methods and the implementation of research on 
irradiation control. Since there are not sufficient means of 
heavy irradiation or post-irradiation testing in Japan, we need 
to depend largely on overseas facilities. Also, we do not have a 
sufficient number of researchers. It is, therefore, 
indispensable as an emphasized policy to establish irradiation 
and testing facilities with powerful new functions. 
  In the development of nuclear fusion reactor materials, in 
particular, gaseous nuclear transformation products, H and He, 
that affect various proprieties of the reactor materials, 
including displacements per atom (dpa), are produced 
simultaneously in large amounts, one or two orders of magnitude 
more than in fission reactors. This is because the neutron 
energy as well as radiation dose in the interaction between 
high-energy neutrons and materials is about one order of 
magnitude larger at 14 MeV than in nuclear fission reactors. 
  High-energy and high-flux neutron irradiation facilities are 
necessary for precise forecasts of phenomena peculiar to such 
high-energy neutron irradiation, and to the development of 
durable materials, but no such facility exists anywhere in the 
world. Therefore, irradiation by electrons and ions has been 
used in the basic stage, and experiments that simulate the 
irradiation effects of high-energy neutrons has been conducted. 
The triple/dual beam system installed in the Takasaki Ion 
Irradiation Facility for Radiation Applications (TIARA) of 
JAERI's Takasaki Radiation Chemistry Research Establishment, 
among others, is expected to contribute to our ability to 
forecast three events simultaneously -- displacement damage by 
elastic collision, helium generated by nuclear transformation 
reactions, and the generation of hydrogen, as well as the 
interactions derived from them. 
  At the basic engineering stage, the spectrum coordinated 
heavy irradiation experiment (HFIR/ORR Project) has been 
conducted based on a cooperative design between Japan (JAERI) 
and the United States (ORNL). Figure VII (1)-1 illustrates the 
effects of high-energy neutrons on materials in a 
three-dimensional manner. Since existing testing equipment, such 
as nuclear reactors, is limited in spite of its usefulness, we 
would expect the establishment of a means for high-energy 
neutron irradiation as soon as possible. 



  In this section, we will survey the project for the Energy 
Selective Neutron Irradiation Test Facility (ESNIT), a 
one-of-a-kind high-energy neutron irradiation test facility, and 
the ion irradiation test facility of the Takasaki Radiation 
Chemistry Research Establishment, which makes it possible to 
simulate the behavior of materials in the environment of nuclear 
fusion reactor irradiation. 
<H3>  1. Project for Energy Selective Neutron Irradiation Test 
Facility (ESNIT) for Materials Research </H3>
  The first experiment to design and develop a testing 
facility 
for materials irradiation research on a full scale using a 
neutron source other than nuclear reactors was the Fusion 
Material Irradiation Test Facility (FMIT) project in the United 
States. The project was implemented with strategic judgment 
given that there was no existing means to properly approximate 
either the importance of materials in the development of nuclear 
fusion nor the material irradiation effects caused by heavy 
doses of radiation from high-energy neutrons peculiar to nuclear 
fusion. However, due to changes in the political environment, 
the project was discontinued in the mid-1980s. 
  Activities to secure the means of material irradiation 
testing in the field of nuclear fusion after FMIT development 
(1978-1985) remained within the framework of concept 
examination, and materials research was conducted by an indirect 
approach in which experiments were conducted using alternative 
means supplemented with analytical tools. For the past few 
years, activities have continued internationally under the 
nuclear fusion materials development agreement of the IEA. In 
other words, a conceptual target system, the International 
Fusion Material Irradiation Facility (IFMIF), has been assumed, 
and its ideal specifications have been examined. As candidates 
for IFMIF, an accelerator neutron source and a plasma beam 
neutron source, based on the d-Li stripping reaction and the 
sporation reaction, have been proposed. As a result of 
technological examinations conducted since 1989, it has been 
concluded that the only irradiation device that can be built in 
the near future, and that will meet the requirement of IFMIF, is 
for the time being a d-Li accelerator neutron irradiation device. 
  In Japan, materials development was included as one of the 
major elements of the key technology research program at the 
time of designating the Long-Term Plan for Nuclear Development 
and Use for FY 1987. It was pointed out then that analysis of 
phenomena related to the interaction between materials and 
neutrons, as well as the development of superb materials based 
on this analysis, was an issue of urgency and importance. As one 
of its concrete policies, JAERI proposed an energy selective 
neutron irradiation test facility for materials research based 
on a heavy proton accelerator to function as an innovative 
general-purpose facility for materials research. Since then, 
establishment of the concept, and technological examinations 
have been implemented in consultation with experts inside and 
outside of Japan. 
  ESNIT is a neutron irradiation test facility that integrates 
the neutron source based on the d-Li stripping reaction with the 
same principle as FMIT, on-site test equipment by remote 
control, and a hot cell (modular hot laboratory) based on a new 
concept in a cassette. Its characteristics are that materials 
testing can be conducted in an irradiation field characterized 
by high neutron energy and high neutron flux, and that the 
neutron energy spectrum of the irradiation field created by this 
neutron source has a peak between about 5 and 15 MeV, as well as 
selectivity of the peak energy. It is extremely important to 
establish test space for selectivity of neutron energy, high 
neutron flux, and high radiation doses in complementing the 
properties lacking in irradiation by the conventional nuclear 
reactors. Such a facility is expected to be the basic means of 
research, in addition to research reactors. ESNIT was considered 
at the beginning "to be intended to reinforce key material 
research, including nuclear fusion materials research." At 
present, it is considered to be "one realistic stage to realize 
IFMIF on a full scale," as heavy irradiation testing by neutrons 
in this energy range is indispensable for the development of 
materials for use in nuclear fusion reactors. 
  Figure VII (1)-2 illustrates the concept of ESNIT, which 
consists of [1] the accelerator system, [2] the target system, 
and [3] the testing system. Figure VII (1)-3 depicts the 
conceptual configuration of the accelerator system, the target 
system and the testing system, and their primary specifications 
are presented in Table VII (1)-1. Figure VII (1)-4 illustrates 
the neutron energy spectrum expected in ESNIT in comparison with 
the neutron energy spectrum of compound spectrum reactors 
(HFIR), fast breeder reactors (EBR-11), nuclear spallation 
neutron irradiation facilities (LAMPF), etc. Figure VII (1)-5 
illustrates the neutron energy spectrum generated as a result of 
accelerating deuteron energy change. By changing deuteron 
acceleration energy from 40 MeV to 10 MeV, it should be possible 
to obtain a neutron energy spectrum with a peak between 15 MeV 
and 5 MeV.

  With a maximum of 50 mA for the beam current, an irradiation 
field of 150 cm[.sup]3[/] for neutron flux over 
10[.sup]14[/]n/cm[.sup]2[/]s, or an irradiation field of 
5,800 cm[.sup]3[/] for neutron flux over 
10[.sup]13[/]n/cm[.sup]2[/]s, can be secured (Table VII 
(1)-2). This makes it possible to conduct research on the 
interrelationship between neutrons and neutron radiation, which 
is a basic key to research on materials. It also makes it 
possible to conduct neutron flux on-site experiments that 
correspond to the neutron barrier load of the nuclear fusion 
demonstration reactor for nuclear fusion reactor materials 
development, as well as life time evaluation testing, although 
there is a limit in the number of test pieces due to the 
restriction on irradiation volume. Although there is restriction 
on the test volume for the accelerator neutron source as 
indicated in Table VII (1)-2, the development of irradiation 
technology using micro test pieces is under way as an effective 
means to solve such a problem.

  ESNIT is significant not only as a means of effectively 
solving the problem of materials for use in the high-energy 
neutron range, where conventional nuclear reactors could not 
serve, but also for application in a nuclear fusion reactor 
material irradiation facility. Since the d-Li method is equipped 
with the most advanced technology available, it can be viewed as 
the only facility plan suitable for such objectives. Compared to 
FMIT, as the generated neutron peak energy is varied, the 
nonlinear contribution of the nuclear transformation reaction 
that occurs in the high-energy range can be arranged 
systematically from an experimental standpoint. It also will 
provide a hint as to how to solve the problem presented by the 
effect of the so-called high-energy tail, which is an issue that 
needs to be examined to approximate the neutron environment of 
nuclear fusion reactors with a maximum energy of 14 MeV. The 
amount of radiation, which is an inherent part of the 
accelerator neutron source, can also be increased 
technologically, and there is a sufficient possibility of 
fulfilling the conditions for an ideal image of IFMIF. 
<H3>  2. Ion Irradiation Test Facility for Nuclear Fusion Reactor 
Irradiation Environment Simulation (Triple- and Dual-Beam 
Systems) </H3>
  In conducting experiments designed to simulate the 
irradiation effects of high-energy neutrons, it is important to 
establish quantitative scaling rules by analyzing three events 
simultaneously -- displacement damage caused by elastic 
collisions, helium generated by nuclear transformation 
reactions, and the generation of hydrogen, as well as 
interactions derived from them. 
  For this reason, three pieces of equipment -- a 
medium-energy 
heavy ion irradiation device (3 MV tandem accelerator), a 
low-energy ion irradiation device (400 kV ion injector), and a 
medium-energy light ion irradiation device (3 MV single end 
accelerator) -- have been established at the Takasaki Ion 
Irradiation Facility for Radiation Applications (TIARA) of 
JAERI's Takasaki Radiation Chemistry Research Establishment. 
During the second half of the current fiscal year, vacuum 
chambers for irradiation testing will be connected to each set 
equipment, and irradiation experiments will begin. Ion beams 
from these irradiation devices are used mainly for a triple-beam 
system for on-site analysis of the ion irradiation process, and 
for a triple-beam system that implements simulated irradiation 
experiments by producing the three types of ion beams mentioned 
above. 
  A summary of the three types of ion irradiation devices, 
which constitute the core of TIARA; the features of the triple- 
and dual-beam systems; and the various beam experiments that can 
be done will be discussed. 
<H5>  (1) Ion Irradiation Equipment </H5>
  A series of ion irradiation devices are arranged as 
illustrated in Figure VII (1)-6. Individual irradiation devices 
and corresponding beam lines are separated in three major areas 
so that they can be used individually or in conjunction. The 
irradiation room for the dual- and triple-beam systems to be 
discussed here corresponds to the second target room in the 
center. It indicates the locations of the beam line, where MD1 
and MD2 are used for the dual-beam system, and MT1 is used for 
the triple-beam system, and the vacuum chamber for irradiation. 
Control for the three types of irradiation equipment is 
integrated in the control room, and its system makes possible 
the simultaneous generation and irradiation of ions. Transport 
and irradiation of beams are conducted by a digital remote 
control method that makes it possible to implement reproducible 
irradiation experiments. 



  The medium-energy heavy ion irradiation device is located in 
the upper left corner in Figure VII (1)-6. It is a 9SDH-2 tandem 
electrostatic accelerator with a terminal voltage of 3 MV. It is 
made by NEC, America. As illustrated in Table VII (1)-3, it has 
two types of ion sources, the sputter and RF types, and 
basically it can accelerate almost all ions with the exception 
of inert gas ions from heavy elements above Ne. The gas 
stripping mechanism is used for charge conversion, and the 
acceleration voltage is 0.4-3.0 MV. By selecting the charge 
state, it is possible to implement irradiation testing using 
ions with a broad range of energy that typically is between 1 
and 14-15 MeV. The maximum ion current is between 1 and 14-15 
ÊA, and it is possible to introduce suitable amounts of 
lattice defect and heterogeneous elements to simulate the 
nuclear fusion irradiation environment.

  The low-energy ion irradiation equipment is located in the 
center of Figure VII (1)-6. It is an NH-40 SR ion injection 
research accelerator of the Cockcroft type made by Nisshin 
Electric. As illustrated in Table VII (1)-4, it can vary 
acceleration voltage continually in the range of 10-400 kV. This 
accelerator has a Freeman-type ion source equipped with sputter 
capability, and can generate almost all ion species from H to 
Bi. This is especially suitable for injection simulation 
experiments for nuclear transformation products as most inert 
gas ions can be extracted at high currents of several 10 ÊA. 
However, it does not accelerate heavy hydrogen ions due to a 
restriction concerning radioactivity protection.

  The medium-energy light ion irradiation device is located on 
the right end of Figure VII (1)-6. It is an NC-3000B accelerator 
of the Schenkel type with a terminal voltage of 3 MV. It is made 
by Nisshin Electric. As illustrated in Table VII (1)-5, it can 
vary acceleration voltage continually in a range of +/- 0.4-3.0, 
and electrons can be accelerated. It has far higher accelerated 
vantage stability at +/- 1 x 10 [.sup]approx. 5[/] than the 
other two accelerators. In addition, as the ion source is 
designed specifically for light element gas, a high current can 
be extracted. It is, therefore, an appropriate device for ion 
beam analysis experiments, providing a superb parallel property 
free from the massive injection of light elements and energy 
dispersion. As electron irradiation can be implemented, this 
accelerator can provide a place for simple irradiation defect 
research at ultralow temperatures, which forms the base for the 
nuclear fusion reactor irradiation environment simulated for 
irradiation experiments.

<H5>  (2) Triple-Beam System </H5>
  As illustrated in Figure VII (1)-6, the triple beam system 
consists of vacuum chambers to implement simultaneous injection 
of three types of ions, and is capable of irradiating the 
designated area uniformly by scanning the beams from each 
irradiation device. 
  As discussed earlier, in nuclear fusion reactor systems one 
must take into account deterioration of structural materials, 
breeding materials, and special purpose materials due to lattice 
defects; the simultaneous generation of helium and hydrogen; and 
the interaction of these phenomena. In order to evaluate such 
deterioration quantitatively in a short time, it is necessary to 
gain an understanding of the deterioration of mechanical 
properties, and the alteration of micro-organisms (such as 
generation and change of transfer, formation of deposits, void 
formation, etc.) that cause changes in measurements as functions 
of H and He/dpa. This can be accomplished by implementing triple 
beam irradiation experiments in which H ions and He ions are 
injected simultaneously while providing slinging damage with 
heavy ion irradiation. 
  With regard to structural materials, taking stainless steel 
as an example, slinging damage by Fe or Ni ions is caused by 
ions from the medium-energy heavy ion irradiation. He and H ions 
are acceleration-injected by the medium-energy light ion 
irradiation equipment, as well as the low-energy ion irradiation 
device. The advantage of using the triple-beam system is that 
the ratio of He, H, and dpa can be adjusted as needed. 
  The condition needed for an experiment to simulate 
irradiation damage in tritium breeding material is almost the 
same. The specific irradiation condition for 
Li[.sup]2[/]O[.sub]3[/] is that the simultaneous 
irradiation of O ions at 3-5 MeV, He ions at 1.0-1.5 MeV, and H 
ions at 0.3-0.4 MeV makes it possible to conduct a detailed 
analysis of the interaction of the ions in the solid. As the 
current for individual ions can be varied separately, simulated 
irradiation experiments corresponding to various neutron spectra 
become possible. 
  Micro-organisms are observed in local domains in triple beam 
experiments. Together with irradiation from high-energy 
longer-range H and He ions, uniform slinging damage and helium 
introduction in the direction of depth of the target material 
will be conducted, and changes in its bulk properties will be 
measured. 
<H5>  (3) Dual-Beam System </H5>
  The dual-beam system consists of two types of vacuum 
chambers 
located at MD1 and MD2, as illustrated in Figure VII (1)-6. MD1 
is connected to the medium-energy heavy ion irradiation device, 
as well as to the low-energy ion irradiation device, and MD2 is 
connected to the medium-energy light ion irradiation device, as 
well as to the low-energy ion irradiation device. The basic 
specifications for both vacuum chambers are designed equally, 
and structural changes in the surface as a result of ion 
irradiation from the low-energy ion irradiation device can be 
analyzed on site simultaneously or continually using the ions 
from the medium-energy light and heavy ion irradiation devices. 
As already mentioned, an understanding of the ion irradiation 
damage process on the atomic level is indispensable for a 
quantitative analysis of simulation test of the nuclear fusion 
irradiation environment. Therefore, the dual-beam system, which 
enables ion beam analysis of irradiation temperatures -- an 
important factor controlling the microstructure of irradiation 
defects -- varying continually from 15 K to 300 K has been 
developed. By implementing channeling experiments using single 
crystal test pieces, it becomes possible to extract 
crystallographic information concerning the coupling condition 
of irradiation defects and impurities using temperature as a 
parameter. Such experiments make it possible to analyze 
irradiation effects in detail, with irradiation dose and 
temperature as parameters, since the distribution of irradiation 
defects and impurities in depth can be identified. 
  Injected light element impurities, such as hydrogen 
isotopes, 
can be detected with a high degree of sensitivity based on the 
phenomena of resonant nuclear reaction, and nuclear elastic 
scattering using various ions from the medium-energy heavy ion 
irradiation device. As the energy of the injected heavy ions for 
detection is varied, their distribution according to the depth 
from the surface can be determined with a precision up to 100 
Angstroms. In the meantime, the Rutherford scattering phenomenon 
of [.sup]4[/]He from the medium-energy light ion irradiation 
device is used to analyze the injected heavy elements. By using 
it in conjunction with the ion channeling phenomenon, the type 
of irradiation defect, the distribution of the corresponding 
injected heavy element, and the crystal lattice occupation 
position can be obtained without destructive testing. 
  For examples of typical data obtained from these experiments 
in ion beam analysis, one can refer to the separate sheets. The 
results of such ion beam analysis experiments will form a 
quantitative and universal database needed for research in 
simulated irradiation testing by contrasting them with the 
results of direct observation by an electron microscope.
