  [Text] Hangzhou, February 25 (XINHUA) -- China will resume 
its halted exploration of manganese nodules in the Pacific Ocean 
in the near future, according to the No. 2 Institute of 
Oceanography under the National Bureau of Oceanography. 
  In the early morning of May 2 last year, Xiangyanghong 16, a 
Chinese scientific exploration ship heading for the Pacific 
Ocean for a 187-day research mission, was involved in a 
collision with a foreign ship. The exploration ship and 
millions of dollars worth of instruments and documents sank to 
the bottom of the ocean. 
  Soon after the accident, China decided to resume the 
mission. 
Over the past year, necessary equipment was purchased, produced 
and installed. Xiangyanghong 09, the sister ship of 
Xiangyanghong 16, was transformed and test-navigated for the 
mission.
