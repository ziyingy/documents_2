  [Text] In the early part of the 21st century, a lunar base 
is scheduled to be built for the purpose of exploiting lunar 
resources and making astronomical and scientific observations. 
The first lunar base will be for short-term stays so most of the 
materials will be shipped from earth, but ultimately plans call 
for a long-term colony-type lunar base that will be entirely 
self-sufficient. 
  The surface of the moon is an extremely inhospitable 
environment for humans to live or work in, not merely because it 
lacks oxygen, but also because of the marked differences between 
daytime and nighttime temperatures and other factors such as 
cosmic radiation and meteorites, so one of the important 
functions of a lunar base is to protect its people against those 
type of harsh conditions. There have been a variety of 
suggestions put forward on the type of lunar base to build, but 
among these, the underground lunar base seems to have the 
distinct advantage of being able to use the surface layer of the 
moon as a barrier against cosmic radiation and meteorites. 
  Based on the above perspective, the Takenaka Corp. has 
proposed a gas-balloon method in which a gas-balloon is inserted 
into the surface of the moon and inflated in such a way as to 
form an underground space. 
  In this paper, we outline the gas-balloon method and discuss 
the proposal in terms of the materials used for the gas-balloon. 
<H3>  1. Technical Problems Faced in Constructing an Underground 
Space on the Moon </H3>
  The first thing that we do when constructing an underground 
space on earth is to drill a narrow vertical space, which in 
construction terminology is called a shaft, and then build an 
underground space at the prescribed depth. In the case of the 
moon, however, we cannot expect any cohesion because the soil 
has no water content. This is quite similar to drilling a hole 
in the desert in which the soil cannot hold on its own so the 
drilling surface crumbles. 
  If we drilled a hole into the lunar soil at an angle between 
20ë and 30ë, we would have to drill a shaft having 10 
times the volume of lunar soil in order to drill to the required 
depth. That being the case, we adopted a method in which the 
drilling surface is reinforced using temporary building 
materials such as steel panels and frames. Nevertheless, in 
building the underground lunar base, the following points below 
had to be taken into account because it would be impossible to 
use the same construction methods on the moon as are used on 
earth. 
  (1) Because of the high cost involved in transporting 
materials and machinery from earth to the moon, we feel it would 
be better to limit the use of large drilling equipment and 
temporary materials used in building surface reinforcements. 
  (2) Working in the harsh lunar environment is extremely 
dangerous, so we advise a method of construction that is 
predicated on small workloads and short work periods. 
<H5>  2. Gas-Balloon Construction Method Outlined </H5>
  As we have illustrated in Figure 1, the gas-balloon 
construction method involves building and maintaining an 
underground space by inflating a gas-balloon by means of gas 
pressure. After the balloon is inflated, the living quarters 
inside the underground lunar base are filled with air having the 
same atmospheric pressure as earth (1 atm). If we assume that 
the specific gravity of the soil on the lunar surface is 2.0, 
and that gravity is 1/6 that of earth, we find that the internal 
pressure (1 atm) of the space and the gravity of the lunar soil 
at upper part of the space achieve a balanced state at 
approximately 30 meters below the surface in the interface 
between the 1-atm space and the lunar soil. This puts very 
little stress on the materials used for the interface and allows 
a space to be obtained that has excellent durability and 
structural stability.

  Below, we list some of the basic reasons for constructing an 
underground space using gas pressure. 
  (a) A gas-balloon will inflate according to the pressure of 
the gas that is introduced into it. 
  (b) A gas-balloon starts to inflate by passive destruction 
of 
the soil in the area near the gas balloon. In Figure 2, we 
illustrate the equation for passive destruction of the soil 
surrounding the gas-balloon. For example, the initial pressure 
(Pi) with a hemisphere having a 2.5 m radius can be found in 
Table 1.

  (c) The expansion process of the gas-balloon follows both 
Boyles and Charles laws. 
  (1) P[.sup]g[/] x V[.sub]g[/] 
= N[.sup]g[/] x R x 
T[.sup]g[/] 
  Here, P[.sup]g[/] is the internal pressure of 
the gas-balloon, V[.sup]g[/] the volumetric 
capacity of the gas-balloon, N[.sup]g[/] the 
number of gas moles within the gas-balloon, R the gas 
constant, and T[.sup]g[/] the temperature of the 
gas balloon. 
  In Figure 3, we show a model of the process of opening up 
the 
underground space by gas-balloon. By introducing an initial 
pressure (P[.sup]i[/]) into the gas-balloon at a 
prescribed setting that causes a passive destruction of the 
surrounding soil, the gas-balloon forces aside the surrounding 
soil and starts to inflate. 


<FIG ID=JPRS-JST-007LC-17C>           Figure 3. Inflation Process of Gas Balloon </FIG>



  After starting the inflation process, the gas-balloon 
continues to expand by controlling the incoming gas pressure and 
keeping it at a higher level than the external pressure 
(P[.sup]o[/]) working on the gas-balloon, i.e., 
the soil pressure from the surrounding soil. After the 
underground space is formed to the desired size, a balance is 
created between the gas pressure inside the balloon and the 
external pressure working on the balloon, i.e., soil pressure 
from the surrounding soil. 
  The gas-balloon construction method offers the following 
features: 
  (a) It requires no major drilling work because the 
construction is done by means of gas pressure. 
  (b) It can reduce the amount of temporary construction 
materials and work required for construction by maintaining the 
space by means of gas pressure inside the balloon until the 
construction work on the structures inside the base are complete. 
  (c) It can reduce the amount of structural materials used by 
counting the gas pressure used to maintain the space as part of 
the actual structure. 
<H5>  3. Proposals Concerning Gas-Balloon Materials </H5>
  In the gas-balloon construction method, a base is built 
within an underground space that is formed by balancing external 
pressures such as soil pressure with the gas pressure of the 
balloon. When a gas-balloon is used that is made with an elastic 
material such as rubber, the gas pressure within the balloon 
must be maintained at a certain minimum level until such time 
that the building of structures bearing external pressures such 
as the soil pressure are complete. For that reason, a 
complicated gas control mechanism is required that can account 
for the workers and materials entering and leaving the complex 
gas-balloon during the time that the structure is being built. 
Based on that, the construction process is expected to be quite 
complex. In order to solve this problem, we proposed that a 
superplastic alloy be used for the gas-balloon material. 
  (1) Superplastic Alloy Gas-Balloon 
  When the temperature and distortion rate of a metal having 
an 
isometric and extremely fine crystal grain structure reaches 
certain levels, the material begins to deform with much less 
stress than it would normally, and indicates a high elasticity 
(superplastic deformation). By controlling this elasticity, it 
becomes possible not to cause large differences in strength and 
mechanical properties before and after superplastic deformation. 
  In Figure 4, we show the gas pressure and temperature 
control 
patterns when a gas-balloon made from a superplastic alloy is 
used. By keeping the temperature in the superplasticity region, 
the superplastic gas-balloon is inflated by gas pressure in the 
same way that a gas-balloon made from a material such as rubber 
would do. When the desired space has been formed and the gas 
pressure adjusted so that the inflation stops and the 
superplastic gas-balloon cools, the balloon loses its plasticity 
and recovers its mechanical properties as a metal. As a result, 
the construction of the base becomes extremely easy if the space 
can be maintained by the material strength of the gas-balloon 
itself. 



  (2) Prototype of Superplastic Alloy Gas Balloon 
  We prototyped a superplastic gas-balloon using the prototype 
equipment shown in Figure 5 by sandwiching together two 1.6mm 
thick panels made of an aluminum-based superplastic alloy 

<FIG ID=JPRS-JST-007LC-18A>  Figure 4.  Pressure and Temperature Control Patterns... </FIG>

(AA7475). In Photograph 1 [photograph not reproduced], we show a 
longitudinal view of the inflation process of the prototype 
superplastic gas-balloon. Superplastic deformation in the upper 
panel began as N2 flowed in under superplastic temperatures, and 
60 minutes after gas pressurization began, a space was formed 
with a dome height/base of 0.71.

<H5>  Conclusion </H5>
  When we consider the harshness of the lunar surface, the 
possibility of a lunar base seems almost impossible. Therefore, 
the gas-balloon method could be one of the more effective ways 
of building an underground lunar base. 
  Nonetheless, there are quite a number of technical problems 
that still remain to be solved before the gas-balloon method can 
be implemented practically, so we would like to see future 
research tackle these problems.
