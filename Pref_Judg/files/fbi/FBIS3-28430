headline] 
  [Text] Pyongyang, February 5 (KCNA) -- The U.S. 
imperialists staged a long-distance bombing exercise targeted 
against the northern half of Korea in the skies above Yongwol 
and Pyongchang, South Korea, on February 3, by setting in-motion 
formations of U.S. overseas-based electronic jamming planes, 
pursuit-assault planes and VTOL [vertical takeoff and landing] 
planes, according to military sources. 
  On the same day, the South Korean puppets swiftly deployed 
some 20 tanks and about 300 armed bandits to Ogum-ri from 
Manu-ri, Paju County, Kyonggi Province, and brought 
large-calibre guns into the demilitarized zone along the 
Military Demarcation Line from Kajon-ri, Inje County, South 
Korean Kangwon Province. 
  The desperate military exercises against the northern malf 
of 
Korea fully show the aggressive and bellicose nature of the U.S. 
imperialists and the South Korean puppets.
