<F P=106> [Nikolay Dudnikov report: "Time To Join Forces"] </F>
  [Text] An agreement was signed a few days ago on long-term 
cooperation between two components of the Russian Federation -- 
Khanty-Mansiysk and Yamalo-Nenets Autonomous Okrugs. They 
guarantee "to offer each other a shoulder to lean on" both in 
the economic sphere and in the utilization of financial, 
material, natural, personnel, and other resources. The two 
okrugs intend to unite their scientific-technical and 
information potential in conditions of the emergence of a market 
economy. 
  Given that the okrugs of Yamalo-Nenets and Khanty-Mansiysk 
are main suppliers of oil and gas in Russia, the agreement will 
allow them to bring the question to the government's attention 
on a more fundamental basis in the interests of the territories.
