  [Text] Tokyo, May 18 KYODO -- Japan may accept a French 
proposal to create a whale sanctuary in the Antarctic Ocean if 
it will exclude minke whales, Fisheries Agency officials 
suggested Wednesday [18 May]. 
  Japan expects a compromise to be made on the proposal to be 
put to a vote at the International Whaling Commission (IWC) 
annual conference in Mexico from May 23 to 27. 
  "It is natural to protect more than 10 kinds of large whales 
as resources but (the IWC) can set up a sanctuary by limiting 
its term and its scope," a senior official of the agency said. 
  He suggested that minke whales, which Japan wants to hunt 
commercially, be excluded from the proposed sanctuary. 
  Japan is opposed to the French proposal to designate 
Antarctic waters south of the 40th parallel as a sanctuary for 
whales for 50 years. 
  The last IWC conference, held in Kyoto, western Japan, 
failed 
to gain enough votes to adopt the proposal due to opposition 
from nations supporting commercial whaling such as Japan and 
Norway. 
  Antiwhaling groups including Greenpeace International have 
said the proposal is likely to be adopted at next week's Mexico 
meeting. 
  The 46th IWC General Assembly meeting will be held in the 
Pacific coast resort town of Puerto Vallarta. 
  Japan stopped commercial whaling in 1988 following an IWC 
ban.
