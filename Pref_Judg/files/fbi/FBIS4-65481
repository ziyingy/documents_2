  [Text] Political support is growing for the 
decriminalisation of drug use as investigations continue into a 
lethal supply of pure heroin that has caused the deaths of at 
least eight addicts this week. 
  Environment Minister Konstandinos Laliotis, a senior deputy 
of the ruling Panhellenic Socialist Movement, yesterday 
expressed support for the controlled distribution of drug 
substitutes such as methadone as part of a comprehensive 
rehabilitation programme. 
  His remarks during a radio interview found support from 
party 
officials across the political spectrum. A major overhaul of 
drug policies and their enforcement is expected to be announced 
next week. 
  Justice Minister Yeoryios Kouvelakis, meanwhile, has issued 
a 
directive to all prison officials banning the granting of prison 
leave to convicted drug dealers. It was prompted after drug 
kingpin Adem Huseinoglu, serving a 22-year sentence in Patras, 
failed to return after a five-day leave. 
  The recent heroin deaths have shocked Greeks, with surveys 
showing there are an estimated 400,000 users of hard drugs in 
Greece.
