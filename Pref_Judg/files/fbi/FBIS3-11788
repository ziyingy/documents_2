  24 March 1994 
  Gentlemen: They... Why did they have to do this? Whom are 
they punishing with this attack? If they are trying to justify 
military action against us or against our flag, would it not 
have been better for them to have killed one of us? In this 
way, the country would have bled less than with this infamy we 
are now enduring. Did this man hurt anyone? Who was frightened 
by his dissension from the very group that attempted to keep 
itself in power through him? Who has gained by the shedding of 
his blood? Where were those who protected him? Who was the 
benefactor of that "pacifist" whose hand once again opened the 
heavy door of war? Does this make sense? Is it logical to 
blame the crime on peace in order to deny the possibility of 
peace? What will come next? How many more assassinations will 
follow before we can establish democracy, freedom, and justice? 
  We clearly understand the message this crime writes across 
the sky of the nation. Is it necessary for us to spill more of 
our blood? Well... we knew it, but he did not. Come. We are 
here, where we were born and where we grew up, where we have the 
great heart that supports us, where history and our dead reside. 
We are out here, in the mountains of southeastern Mexico... 
come and get us... we know how to greet each one of you and 
grant you your just desserts... both good and evil... 
  Beware. Nothing is safe anymore, much less the hope for 
peace. Okay. 
  From the mountains of southeastern Mexico

  P.S. -- FOR THOSE NO ONE SEES 
  Greetings, fellow Zapatist moles [topos]. We have sparkled 
thanks to your patient and clandestine work. The black night of 
infamy is upon us once again. The end of our era is coming. We 
promise to shine brightly until we outshine the sun before 
vanishing into thin air. Until the last hour we will embrace 
the clandestine side that supported our gleaming INTERIOR light 
that filtered through us to radiate this bit of history. We are 
at the front, like those who came before us. We will honor the 
dignity of our dead... Brethren moles, we are nearing the end of 
our path... It will then be your turn, dear moles. Do not 
forget what is represented by the steps we have taken. We were 
sincere in determining whether another door would open to our 
dim light. We must now learn a lesson from this lamentable 
tale. Never forget the word that made us great, even if it was 
only for a moment: ALL FOR ALL, NOTHING FOR US. Goodbye armed 
moles; have your flag ready and prepare yourselves and those who 
shall follow you. It is now your turn to cover your faces, 
erase your names, renege from your past, prepare your tender 
fury, and prepare your weapons, because peace is vanishing as 
rapidly as it came. Permit us, my faraway moles, as one final 
salute, to send you our left hand on the temple and also... [as

  A GIFT AND A POLITICAL CLASS 
  A section of the moon... /but in reality it is not one/ but 
two sections:/ the section of the dark side of the moon/ and the 
section of the bright side of the moon. /And here, what one must 
understand/ is that the section of the moon that shines /does so 
because there is a dark side./ It is the dark side of the moon 
/that makes the bright side/ of the moon possible. The same 
holds true for us. /If we are to become the dark side of the 
moon/ it does not mean that we have been cheapened /but that we 
are ready/ to be the dark side /which makes it possible for all 
to see the moon/ (and in the end, /the dark side is more 
valuable/ because it shines for other eras /and because to see 
it/ one must learn to fly at extreme heights). 
  Moreover, this is how /there can be a few people prepared/ 
to 
suffer so that others do not suffer /and to die/ in order that 
others may live, and this is so /because of boots [botas], moon, 
etc./ period. [sentence as published] 
  Okay, my venerable moles, we shall meet again under the 
earth... 
  [Signed] Subcommander Marcos
