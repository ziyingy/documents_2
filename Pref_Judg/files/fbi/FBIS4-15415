  [Text] The nuclear warheads of the torpedoes in the 
nuclear-powered submarine Komsomolets that sank exactly five 
years ago in the Norwegian Sea remain intact. Officials in the 
Northern Fleet's press center told Interfax Thursday that 
radiometric and spectrometric sampling of the sea water and 
bottom suggested that there was no plutonium-239 in the spot 
where the submarine had sunk. The cesium-137 content there was 
one ten thousandth of the admissible value for drinking water. 
The gamma radiation at the sea surface ranged from 1.5 to 5 
microRoentgen per hour. 
  The officials also said that the Semyon Dezhnyov research 
ship was taking samples in the area. According to the April 7 
data, the radiation there stayed within background values. 
  The press center head Vladimir Pyzh emphasized that the 
Northern Fleet had never intended to make the state of affairs 
secret and wanted the radiation situation in that area and 
elsewhere where nuclear ships of other countries had sunk to be 
reported impartially. 
  He said that two Soviet and two US submarines had sunk in 
that area. Pyzh added that the Northern Fleet command wanted 
reports and forecasts on what was going on or would happen where 
Komsomolets had sunk to be based on specific tests and accurate 
data.
