  [Text] "The Colombian Government has replied to the U.S. 
State Department letter in accordance to its duty: to defend 
the honesty of the institutions and judicial authorities." 
Presidential candidate Andres Pastrana has made this statement 
as he expressed his support for the Colombian response to the 18 
April U.S. letter questioning Prosecutor General Gustavo de 
Greiff's attitude. 
  Pastrana has said: "It is worrisome that as policies of 
submission [sometimiento] are enforced certain self-confessed 
criminals tarnish the names of other parties and even the image 
of an entire country so as to have their sentences reduced for 
allegedly collaborating with authorities." 
  Pastrana also urged the two governments to reestablish the 
lines of communication, to normalize bilateral relations, and to 
reactivate the mechanisms of judicial collaboration to fight 
international drug trafficking. 
  Meanwhile, Pastrana has reiterated his opposition to the 
legalization of drugs, saying: "Should Senator Kerry or any 
other U.S. authority have substantial information that will 
contribute to preventing drug trafficking from interfering with 
Colombian politics, he must say it immediately by providing the 
details he knows."
