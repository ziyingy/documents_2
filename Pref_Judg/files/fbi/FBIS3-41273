  [Text] Prague, Feb 9 (CTK) -- Czech Police have succeeded 
in busting seven "drug labs," seizing 10 kg of narcotic 
substances worth at least 10 million korunas ($350,000), a Czech 
Police spokesman told journalists today. 
  Thirteen people involved in the production and distribution 
of the hard drugs seized--mainly pervitin and efedrin 
[ephedrine]--have been detained as a result of "Operation Wind" 
in which the drug squad of the Criminal Police Central Office 
(UKP) was joined by the Prague Investigations Office. 
  The drug haul was previously reported as having a street 
value of one million korunas ($34,000). 
  The operation, which took place on February 1-2, was the 
biggest and most successful conducted in recent years against 
drug production in Prague, the spokesman said. 
  The suspects have also been charged with illegal possession 
of weapons. 
  According to chief of the drug squad Miroslav Bornik, the 
squad launched 625 operations last year and detained a total of 
109 suspects. 
  Bornik said the raid was particularly successful because the 
police did not only find "the normal boilers" where the drugs 
are produced but also a layer of people who were concerned only 
with dealing. He added that the drug squad returned to a 
laboratory they had destroyed only a few hours earlier to find 
it completely re-equipped and operational again. 
  During the raid police also discovered a considerable sum of 
money, communications technology, and two stolen cars, he said. 
  Czech anti-drug legislation is in contradiction with the 
NATO 
agreement of 1988, Bornik said. In his view, if possession of 
drugs for personal use is legal and no quantity is specified, it 
is extremely difficult to take action against producers and 
manufacturers. Prosecution would be possible only if a dealer 
was caught in the very moment he passed drugs onto someone else, 
he said.
