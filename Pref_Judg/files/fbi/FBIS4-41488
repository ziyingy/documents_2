  [Text] Members of the leading Russia's Choice (RC) 
parliamentary faction have thrown weight behind the government- 
proposed budget after rejecting it in the three previous rounds 
of voting. RC leader Yegor Gaydar said his faction was led by 
two main reasons in reversing its decision. On the one hand, 
any attempt to try to improve the budget by the present 
parliament would be hopeless. On the other, the RC did not want 
any political gambling by the Liberal Democrats over the budget. 
  Gaydar described the proposed budget as totally unrealistic 
with its revenue and expenditure parts being far too high. In 
his view, the paper reflects the existing balance of forces in 
the State Duma following last December's election and a strong 
pressure by sectorial lobby groups in parliament. 
  The RC leader said both administration and government 
representatives had appealed to his faction during a break in 
vote-taking and the RC "accepted their considerations, 
particularly those relating to LDP demands in exchange for their 
support". Gaydar denied having engaged in any horse trading on 
the issue.
