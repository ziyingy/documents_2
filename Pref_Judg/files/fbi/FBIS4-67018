  [Text] The German police no longer believe in punishment 
for drugs, and are giving up chasing petty drug pushers. They 
refuse to do senseless things like prosecuting drug addicts. 
This can clearly be seen from the (not yet published) crime 
figures for 1993, which show that the number of recorded drug 
offenses in the north German lands is sinking dramatically. In 
Schleswig-Holstein, drug-related crime has fallen by 33.4 
percent. That is not at all because drug addiction has 
disappeared there. It is primarily because the police are no 
longer chasing petty drug offenders. That has been the case for 
several years now regarding the consumption of soft drugs, and 
has applied to hard drugs since 1993. Only in Bavaria, where 
the police are under pressure from conservative-repressive 
politics, do police figures on drug offenses show an increase. 
  German juvenile court judges and juvenile lawyers have also 
had enough. They consider the drug policy up to now to have 
been a failure, and say it is wrong to turn drug addicts into 
criminals. At their first federal-level meeting in December 
1993, they called for the free dispensation of drugs. The 
juvenile judges observe on a day-to-day basis that one cannot 
heal sick people by means of punishment, and that a therapy 
ordained under compulsion seldom works. That means that the 
prosecution of drug-addicts only helps the dealer-Mafia, who 
force a drug addict, who needs 250 German marks worth of drugs a 
day, into crime. However, the legislators' panic-ridden fear of 
anything connected with liberalization has prevented a revision 
of drugs policy until now. 
  The thought-provoking practice of courts and judges was 
based 
on the assumption that the Federal Court would approve of it, 
that it would supply a tail wind. It was expected that the 
Court would abolish criminal proceedings at least in cases 
involving the soft drug hashish. However, the wind that came 
from Karlsruhe yesterday is no wind of change, merely a light 
breeze. The Constitutional Court judges did not lift the ban on 
hashish. Neither did they nullify the law governing the use of 
anesthetics. They merely called for a more restrained 
consumption. Regarding the private consumption of hashish, 
punishment will be applied less than has been the case until 
now. This involves restrained, cautious sentences, but 
certainly not a general green light for the drugs policy 
currently in force. The judges merely said that the code of 
punishment for drugs is not so harsh that it can be considered 
unconstitutional. Constitutionally, it is still "acceptable" 
for the legislators to abide by their previous concept of 
repression. But that also means that they are free to revise 
their way of thinking. 
  Revising their way of thinking includes a recognition of the 
fact that drug addicts are, first and foremost, sick people. It 
also includes a recognition of the fact that crime in Germany 
would immediately fall by 10 to 20 percent if these sick people 
were treated instead of being turned into criminals.
