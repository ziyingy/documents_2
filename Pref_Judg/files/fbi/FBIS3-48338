  [Text] According to reports from the UN Headquarters, a 
Chinese representative spoke on 21 January at the second session 
of the preparatory committee for the Nuclear Nonproliferation 
Treaty [NPT] signatories' meeting to be held in 1995. In his 
address, he denounced some nuclear powers for lacking sincerity 
toward peace. 
  He said that the NPT itself is not the ultimate aim of 
mankind and insisted that mankind's ultimate aim is complete 
prohibition [kumji] and abolition [pagoe] of nuclear weapons. 
He stressed that the nuclear states' refusals to agree to 
prohibit and abolish nuclear weapons is effecting the permanence 
of the imbalance in rights and duties that are stipulated in the 
treaty for nuclear and nonnuclear states and that as a result, 
it has become impossible to completely guarantee the security 
demanded by many nonnuclear states. 
  He asked: If nuclear states -- particularly, nuclear powers 
that have worldwide nuclear attack ability -- only emphasize 
nuclear nonproliferation and absolute safety for themselves and 
ignore nonnuclear states' justified concerns, how on earth can 
nonnuclear states be expected to trust the nuclear powers' 
sincerity toward peace? 
  He appealed to all nuclear states not to use nuclear weapons 
first and not to use or threaten to use nuclear weapons against 
nonnuclear states and nuclear-free zones.
