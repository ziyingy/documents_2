"Cattle Are Tested for AIDS-Like Illness"] 
  [Text] Scientists are investigating what they think may be 
an AIDS-like disease of cattle in Britain. Samples of blood from 
the sick animals are being tested for signs of a virus that is 
related to HIV, the cause of AIDS in humans. 
  Experts on BIV (bovine immuno-deficiency virus) at the 
Institute for Animal Health in Berkshire were called in after a 
cattle herd from a farm in Cheshire developed breathing 
difficulties and other symptoms that resisted treatment. 
  Joe Brownlie, head of the institute's BIV research team, 
confirmed that tests had been run to detect the virus or its 
antibodies. "We are actively investigating," he said. "There are 
no confirmed results as yet. At this stage, it is more of a 
look-see exercise." 
  The Agriculture Ministry declined to disclose details of the 
disease on the farm or its exact whereabouts. Keith Meldrum, the 
Chief Veterinary Officer, said the animals were being tested for 
other viruses as well as BIV. 
  Scientists say they can see no threat from BIV to human 
health because lentiviruses (a group including BIV and HIV that 
is known to provoke slow-developing sickness in horses, goats, 
cats and sheep as well as humans) are highly specific to 
particular species. 
  BIV was isolated in the United States in the early 1970's, 
though initially given a different name. It was only in the 
mid-1980's that scientists noticed the similarity between BIV 
and HIV.
