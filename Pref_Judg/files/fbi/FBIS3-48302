  [Text] Tokyo, Jan. 21 Kyodo -- Russia has declined a 
Japanese offer to supply a tanker for temporary storage of its 
excess nuclear waste, saying the tanker's facilities are 
inadequate, government sources said Friday [21 January]. 
  Japan made the offer last month in response to a Russian 
call 
for assistance so that it would not have to dispose of the waste 
at sea following protests from Japan over the ocean disposal of 
900 tons of liquid nuclear waste in the Sea of Japan in October. 
The dumping caused an international furor. 
  At Russo-Japanese talks at the Foreign Ministry in Tokyo on 
December 21, Russia proposed the use of a tanker. 
  The Russian side said at the time that it was storing about 
1,900 tons of liquid radioactive waste in four vessels and other 
facilities around Vladivostok, but needed help in finding 
storage space for an additional 5,000 to 25,000 tons of the 
waste. 
  An estimated 5,000 tons of liquid radioactive waste are 
generated annually in Russia as a result of the dismantling of 
nuclear-powered submarines. 
  Japan later offered a Panamanian-registered tanker, but the 
sources said that after three Russian experts inspected the 
vessel in Singapore, they concluded it was not properly equipped 
to store radioactive waste. 
  Instead, Russia will store the waste in a vessel acquired 
locally. 
  The vessel can only store a limited volume of waste and 
Japanese government officials say they will eventually have to 
face the prospect of assisting Russia to build on-land storage 
facilities for the waste.
