**December to December 


<H5>  Production and Use of Gross Domestic Product </H5>
  Gross Domestic Product [GDP], which is calculated as the 
difference between gross production and intermediate 
consumption, and characterizes the value of finished output 
destined for end consumption, accumulation, and export, totaled 
162.3 trillion rubles [R], down 12 percent compared with 1992. 
This was due to the fall in production of goods and services in 
most sectors of the economy, including falls of 16.2 percent in 
industry, 7 percent in construction, and 4 percent in 
agriculture. 
  In 1993 almost 58 percent of GDP was utilized for end 
consumption compared to 54 percent in 1992. The proportion of 
accumulation in GDP dropped 6.2 percent in 1993. 
<H6>  Industry </H6>
  Production dropped 16.2 percent in real terms compared with 
1992 -- 16.1 percent in December. Civilian output dropped 15.9 
percent and military production was down 29 percent (in 1992 the 
figures were 12 and 42 percent respectively). 
  In 1993 industrial production was down 37 percent on the 
1990 
figure, including drops of 28 and 38 percent in the extraction 
and processing sectors respectively. 
  During 1993 the greatest fall in production compared with 
the 
corresponding period in 1992 was recorded in January (down 21.8 
percent), the smallest in August (down 12 percent). 
  Production of 234 (89 percent) out of 262 categories of 
reported industrial output dropped, while production of 28 
categories (11 percent) rose. 
  The reduction in production differs substantially from 
sector 
to sector and production facility to production facility. 
Production of fuel and raw material resources dropped 3-12 
percent, investment output -- 20-40 percent, output destined for 
agriculture -- 22-41 percent, basic foodstuffs -- 10-24 percent, 
and light industry goods -- 13-34 percent. Production of 
certain categories of consumer durables rose 8-9 percent. 
  Last year it did not prove possible to carry out the 
comprehensive structural reorganization of industry and the 
sector's production structures tended to become more cumbersome. 
  In 1993 there was a substantial increase in lost work time 
owing to protracted stoppages at production units due to 
difficulties in selling output, lack of material resources, etc. 
Whereas in 1992 1,400 enterprises (6 percent of the total) 
stopped production for more than a single shift every month on 
average, in 1993 the figure rose to 2,500 enterprises (12 
percent), including complete production stoppages at 206 
enterprises. In 1993, 115 million man-days' work time were 
lost, 10 percent of the scheduled work time at the enterprises 
where the stoppages occurred; each industrial worker accounted 
for six lost working days. 
  Machine building, metal working, light industry, chemical, 
and petrochemical enterprises accounted for 84 percent of the 
total lost worktime. Half the stoppages were caused by 
difficulties in selling output owing to customers' insolvency 
and a fall in demand, while 38 percent were due to lack of 
material resources. At the same time, whereas in 1992 and early 
1993 the main cause of stoppages was lack of material resources, 
as of the second quarter of 1993 there was an increase in the 
proportion of losses due to difficulties in selling output, 
which rose to total 57 percent in the fourth quarter. 
  A high level of production concentration is characteristic 
of 
industry in the Russian Federation since in the past industry 
was geared to the development of large enterprises. 
  The bulk of industrial production is currently concentrated 
at large enterprises. Around 2 percent of industrial 
enterprises (with over 5,000 employees) produce over 40 percent 
of all output, production of which generates over half of all 
industrial profits. 
  The concentration of production has resulted in a situation 
where all production of trolleybuses, potato harvesting 
combines, scooters, diggers, tunneling combines, certain 
categories of rubber, cationic dyes, photographic film, and a 
whole set of other output is concentrated at one enterprise in 
Russia at present. 
  Oligolopoly is characteristic of many industrial sectors -- 
where production of a sizable proportion of similar output is 
concentrated at two to four major enterprises. Thus, for 
instance, dynamo steel is produced by three enterprises, which 
account for virtually all production of this product; four 
produce polystyrene and copolymers (96 percent), four produce 
agricultural vehicle tires (82 percent), two produce magnetic 
tape (100 percent), three produce soda ash (92 percent), and 
three produce motorized graders (100 percent). 
  The two-sided monopoly where you have one vendor and one 
customer in the marketplace is a kind of oligopoly. This 
situation has developed with regard to the production of truck 
engines produced by Volga Motor Plant produces; their only 
customer is the Gorkiy Automobile Plant Production Association. 
The mainline electric locomotives that are only produced by the 
Novocherkassk Electric Locomotive Plant are all bought by the 
Russian Ministry of Railways. 
  In fuel and energy sectors, in standard equivalent terms, 
extraction and production of all categories of primary energy 
resources dropped 6 percent in 1993 compared with 1992. Some 
956 billion kilowatt-hours of electricity were produced (down 5 
percent on 1992) and 352 million tonnes of oil were extracted, 
including gas condensate (down 12 percent), along with 618 
billion cubic meters of gas (down 3 percent) and 305 million 
tonnes of coal (down 9 percent). 
  The drastic fall in oil extraction over the last few years 
has brought structural changes in the fuel balance. The 
proportion of oil, including gas condensate, in total fuel 
extraction dropped to 35 percent in 1993 compared with 42 
percent in 1990, while that of gas rose to 49 percent compared 
to 42 percent and coal remained virtually unchanged. 
  In ferrous metallurgy, production of basic output dropped in 
1993 owing to a fall in demand: 40.5 million tonnes of cast 
iron (down 12 percent on 1992) and 58.3 million tonnes of steel 
(down 13 percent) were smelted; 42.7 million tonnes of finished 
rolled metal (down 9 percent) and 5.8 million tonnes of steel 
pipe (down 28 percent) were produced. Production of many 
progressive categories of metal output dropped still further. 
The adverse structural changes in the sector's raw material 
base are continuing: "Vtormet" Joint-Stock Company organizations 
reduced procurement of scrap metal 34 percent compared with 
1992, while iron ore extraction was down 7 percent. As a result 
steel smelting is making greater use of cast iron and less of 
the relatively cheap scrap metal. 
  Production of many goods dropped substantially in machine 
building owing to the decline in customers' effective demand -- 
production of one-fourth of 62 most important categories of 
reported output was down 20-40 percent, while production of 
one-third of these goods was down 50 percent or more. 
  Production of high-technology output dropped, in particular 
metal cutting tools and forging and pressing machines with 
digital program control, which were down by a factor of 4-6. 
Production of railroad and agricultural machine building output 
and construction equipment was down (30-70 percent). 
  Production of automobile industry output, for which there is 
a relatively steady demand, dropped less. In 1993, 956,000 
passenger cars were produced (99.3 percent of the 1992 level) 
and 47,200 buses (98 percent). 
  Structural transformations in defense industry sectors in 
connection with the conversion of military production were a 
characteristic feature of last year. Whereas early in the year 
conversion encompassed 687 defense complex enterprises, at the 
end of the year the figure was 719, 68 percent of the total 
number of enterprises in these sectors. Overall production at 
enterprises undergoing conversion dropped 11 percent. 
Nonmilitary output at enterprises undergoing conversion 
represented around three-fourths of their total output. 
Two-thirds of the work force are employed in producing this 
output. 
  Compared with 1992 there have been changes in the funding 
structure for conversion. The amount of federal budget 
appropriations has dropped somewhat (from 24 to 18 percent), 
while the proportion of raised funds, including bank credit and 
foreign investment, has risen (from 31 to 48 percent). 
  The decline in production in the chemical and petrochemical 
industry in 1993 is due to limited raw materials and 
semimanufactures, both Russian and from nearby and distant 
foreign countries (one-fourth of the sector's consumption). 
Some 9.9 million tonnes of synthetic ammonia (down 7 percent on 
1992), 8.2 million tonnes of sulfuric acid (down 15 percent), 2 
million tonnes of soda ash (down 26 percent), 1.4 million tonnes 
of caustic soda (down 22 percent), 8.6 million tonnes of mineral 
fertilizers (down 22 percent), 349,000 tonnes of chemical fibers 
and yarns (down 26 percent), and 36.1 million automobile tires 
(down 14 percent) were produced. 
  The chemical and pharmaceutical industry cut production of 
11 
out of 16 highly important pharmacotherapeutic groups of 
preparations, including cancer preparations, analgesics, 
febrifuges, antipyretics, anti-TB preparations, antiasthmatics, 
antihistamines, preparations for the treatment of dysbacteriosis 
[disbakterioz], eye disease, and endocrinological and digestive 
complaints. Production of preparations for the treatment of 
sugar diabetes, as well as contrast mediums and other diagnostic 
aids, has been suspended. Substances which are in increased 
demand among the population have become scarce: nitroglycerine, 
papaverine, and vitamins, production of which was at 86-93 
percent of the 1992 level; levomycetin, analgine, and validol, 
at 61-68 percent of the 1992 level; and klofelin [translation 
unknown] and ampicillin, at 48-54 percent of the 1992 level. 
  In the timber procurement industry commercial timber 
production dropped by more than one-fourth compared with 1992. 
That is due to high equipment wear-out rates, a reduction in 
the construction of timber-carrying roads, too-late allocation 
of credit, and increased shipment costs. 
  There has been a considerable fall in production of the most 
important categories of timber processing and pulp and paper 
output. In 1993, production of lumber totaled 39.9 million 
cubic meters (25 percent down on the 1992 level), pit props -- 
450,000 cubic meters (down 55 percent), commercial pulp -- 1.6 
million tonnes (down 21 percent), and paper -- 2.9 million 
tonnes (down 20 percent). 
  A reduction in industrial construction brought a reduction 
in 
production in the construction materials industry. Some 50.1 
million tonnes of cement (down 19 percent on 1992), 3,249 
million standard slates (down 28 percent), 19.1 billion bricks 
(down 12 percent), and 101 million square meters of window glass 
(down 13 percent) were produced. 
  Production of general construction materials and goods 
dropped to a lesser extent: Production of panels for 
large-panel housing construction, steel wall and roofing panels, 
ceramic facing slates, and construction glass dropped 13-26 
percent, and production of ceramic sanitary ware was down 7 
percent. 
  In 1993, light industry enterprises produced 3.7 billion 
square meters of fabric (27 percent down on 1992), 547 million 
pairs of hosiery (down 13 percent), 340 million items of 
knitwear (down 26 percent), and 146 million pairs of footwear 
(down 34 percent). 
  Structural changes can be glimpsed in the sector in terms of 
an increase in production of output for high-income population 
groups, Thus, in 1993 there was virtually no fall in the 
production of real fur overcoats for adults compared with 1992 
at a time when production of fake fur and cloth overcoats 
dropped 52 and 28 percent respectively. 
  Over the year production of children's goods dropped most: 
hosiery and knitwear by almost one-third and footwear by half. 
  A different situation developed with regard to the 
production 
of cultural-consumer and household goods. In 1993, 3.5 million 
refrigerators and freezers (9 percent up on 1992), 4 million 
television sets (8 percent up), 3.9 million washing machines 
(down 10 percent), 1.4 million sewing machines (down 13 
percent), 2.2 million tape players (down 20 percent), and 
270,000 videocassette recorders (down 39 percent on 1992) were 
produced. 
  The fall in production of a number of commodities, 
videocassette recorders and tape players in particular, is due 
to the increased supply of high-quality imports on the consumer 
market. 
  Enterprises producing china and majolica operated fairly 
stably last year, although by the end of the year production was 
tending to drop (99.7 percent). Production of cast-iron ferrous 
and drawn aluminum vessels more than halved. In 1993 ski 
production was only 30 percent of the 1992 level, including 18 
percent for children's skis. Production of many sports goods 
dropped. 
  In 1993 the drop in production of certain foodstuffs slowed 
down: 4.0 million tonnes of meat, 8.2 million tonnes of 
whole-milk products, 1.1 million tonnes of vegetable oil, and 
3.9 million tonnes of sugar were produced. 
  Production of vegetable oil, prepared meat products, fatty 
cheeses, sheep's cheese, canned milk products, and mayonnaise 
rose. 
  With regard to babyfood in 1993 production of liquid and 
pureed dairy products, dried milk mixtures, canned meat, fruit, 
and vegetables totaled just 26-49 percent of the targets 
prescribed by the State Program for the Development of the 
Babyfood Industry, while production of cereal-based dried foods 
was just 14 percent of the prescribed level. Compared with 1992 
production of liquid and pureed dairy products rose. However, 
production of these products dropped in 50 percent of regions. 
The situation that has developed with regard to the production 
of babyfood is due to enterprises' lack of packaging and 
wrapping materials supplied by nearby and distant foreign 
countries and also to trading organizations' rejection of 
babyfood owing to the high price thereof. 
<H6>  Capital Construction </H6>
  In 1993 Russian enterprises under all forms of ownership 
absorbed R25.2 trillion in capital investment. 
  Enterprises' own funds (over 60 percent of all capital 
investments) are the main source of funding for capital 
construction. Centralized funds financed by the republic's 
budget account for 17.5 percent, local budget funds for 15 
percent, investment funds for 3.3 percent, and preferential 
credit for 1.7 percent. 
  State enterprises and organizations (59 percent) and 
joint-stock companies (29 percent as opposed to 6.7 percent in 
1992) account for the largest proportion of capital invested. 
  Some R15 trillion or 60 percent of all capital investments 
were utilized on the construction of production facilities. The 
largest proportion of production investment is channeled into 
the development of the fuel and energy complex (around 40 
percent), the agro-industrial complex (18 percent), machine 
building (7 percent), and the chemical, timber, and construction 
complexes (5 percent each). 
  Some 193 of the 652 federal investment program facilities 
due 
for commissioning in 1993 were been commissioned (122 in full 
and 71 in part). The level of program fulfillment totaled 30 
percent, including 42 percent for budget-funded facilities and 
26 percent for facilities funded by credit investment resources. 
  The agro-industrial complex spent R4.1 trillion in capital 
investment from all sources of funding, down one-third on 1992. 
State budget funds accounted for one-fifth of the total 
investment in the agro-industrial complex. Some 42 highly 
important agro-industrial complex facilities were commissioned 
in 1993 from this source of funding under federal investment 
programs (13 percent of the annual program if you include 
partial commissioning,). 
  Unfinished construction is continuing to build up. In 1993 
the amount of unfinished construction is estimated to have 
increased by 20-25 percent. Production facilities account for 
over two-thirds of this. 
  In 1993 the rate of nonproduction construction dropped less 
than that in the production sphere, making it possible to 
somewhat increase the amount of housing and a number of other 
social facilities that were commissioned compared with 1992. 
  In 1993 enterprises under all forms of ownership built 
apartment blocks with a total area of 41.8 million square meters 
or 100.7 percent of the 1992 level (68 percent of the 1990 
level). 
  State enterprises and organizations commissioned 22.0 
million 
square meters or 99.1 percent of the 1992 level and 53 percent 
of the total amount of housing built. 
  The nonstate sector of the economy built 2 percent more 
housing than in 1992. At the same time the situation with 
regard to housing construction by joint-stock companies (up 4 
percent on 1992), economic partnerships (up 11 percent), and 
individual developers (up 13 percent) developed most favorably. 
  Enterprises and organizations under all forms of ownership 
commissioned general education schools with 299,600 places (1 
percent down on 1992), preschool establishments with 61,500 
places (36 percent down), hospitals with 14,300 beds (75 percent 
up), and outpatient clinics catering for 45,900 patients per 
shift (up 16 percent). 
<H6>  Agriculture </H6>
  Within the framework of the agrarian reform in Russia in 
1993 
the reorganization of kolkhozes and sovkhozes continued, lands 
were redistributed and privatized, and social and structural 
transformations were accomplished. 
  By the end of 1993 over 24,000 kolkhozes and sovkhozes had 
been reregistered, which is 95 percent of their total. Various 
types of partnership have become the main organizational form of 
management (there are 11,500 of them). Around 300 open-type 
joint-stock companies, over 400 subsidiary plots of enterprises 
and organizations, 2,000 agricultural cooperatives, and 3,000 
other enterprises of new organizational-legal forms of 
management have been created on the basis of the reorganized 
kolkhozes and sovkhozes. The collectives of one farm in three 
have adopted a decision to preserve the status of their 
enterprise. At present agricultural enterprises with a state 
form of ownership account for no more than 15 percent of 
agricultural lands and value of produce. 
  The creation of new peasant (private) farms in 1993 
proceeded 
more slowly. In the year as a whole their number increased by 
87,000 (in 1992 by 134,000) and by 1 January 1994 totaled 
270,000 with a land area of 11.3 million hectares (an average of 
42 hectares per farm). Agricultural land on those farms 
occupies 10.4 million hectares (92 percent of the total) with 
plowland forming 7.5 million hectares (66 percent). Private 
farmers held 5 percent of the country's agricultural land and 6 
percent of the plowland. 
  Because of the increased difficulties with material and 
technical support, the deterioration of the financial position, 
and other factors 14,000 private farms stopped trading in 1993, 
5,000 of them in the fourth quarter (5,000 closed down in the 
whole of 1992). Out of every 100 farms created in 1993 14 
peasant holdings ceased operations as against four in 1992. 
  The allocation of land for collective horticulture and truck 
farming continued. In 1993 over 0.8 million families received 
plots on collective horticultural farms with an area of 
approximately 80,000 hectares and 3.0 million families received 
a total of 200,000 hectares on truck farms. Land was also 
allocated for personal plots and dacha construction. 
  The land redistribution processes predetermined the 
structural changes in agriculture. 
  The proportion of gross agricultural output, in value terms, 
produced by the population's farms increased from 24 percent in 
1990 to 36 percent in 1993, areas sown to potatoes increased 
accordingly from 58 percent to 77 percent, and vegetables from 
34 percent to 60 percent. In 1993 the population grew over 80 
percent of the potatoes and 66 percent of the vegetables. The 
potato yield on the population's plots was noticeably higher 
than on agricultural enterprises. Similar processes are 
occurring in stockraising. The private sector's share of meat 
production rose in the past three years from 25 percent to 38 
percent, of milk production from 24 percent to 34 percent, and 
of egg production from 22 percent to 27 percent. Cattle 
productivity on personal plots is also higher than the level in 
agricultural enterprise livestock units. 
  According to the preliminary figures, the volume of gross 
agricultural production in 1993 in comparable prices fell by 4 
percent compared with the previous year while on the 
population's private subsidiary plots the value of gross output 
rose by 4 percent. 
  In 1993, 99 million tonnes of grain were harvested (93 
percent of the 1992 level). The harvests of sugar beets (25.5 
million tonnes), potatoes (38.1 million tonnes), and vegetables 
(9.8 million tonnes) were approximately at the 1992 level. The 
gross harvest of sunflowers for seed was 2.8 million tonnes (11 
percent less than in 1992) while for flax the figure was 58,000 
tonnes (26 percent down). The sowing of winter crops and the 
fall plowing were noticeably behind the 1992 performance. An 
area of 15.5 million hectares of winter crops were sown (20 
percent down on 1992) and that included 14.3 million hectares of 
grain (20 percent less). The decline in the area sown to winter 
rye was higher (34 percent) while that of wheat (12 percent) and 
barley (6 percent) was lower. Some 41.9 million hectares of 
fall plowing was carried out, which is 6.2 million hectares (or 
13 percent) less than in fall 1992. 
  In 1993 state resources received 27.4 million tonnes of 
grain 
or 1.3 million tonnes (5 percent) more than in 1992. The 
proportion of grain purchased was 28 percent of production as 
against 24 percent the previous year. Wheat purchases rose by 
16 percent compared with 1992, purchases of oats rose 14 
percent, and purchases of barley and peas were up 30 percent. 
The sale of groat crops to the state fell by one-third, rye by 
a quarter, and strong and durum (high grade) wheat were down by 
two-thirds. 
  Some 11.5 million tonnes of grain (97 percent of the set 
target), 0.5 million tonnes of oil-bearing seeds (43 percent), 
and 3.1 million tonnes of sugar beets (41 percent) were bought 
for supply to the federal fund. 
  Crop sale patterns changed in 1993. A reduction can be 
observed in the proportion of output supplied to the state, 
while sales through other channels are expanding. For example, 
state resources received 28 percent of the sugar beet harvest 
and 21 percent of the sunflower seed crop as against 42 percent 
and 38 percent respectively in the previous year. There was an 
increase in the proportion of these crops sold by commodity 
producers on a customer-supplied basis to processing 
enterprises. The supply of sugar beets by this method rose from 
50 percent of sales volume in 1992 to 65 percent, while the 
figure for sunflowers rose from 25 percent to 68 percent. Sales 
of potatoes and vegetables by all agricultural commodity 
producers fell by 20-30 percent compared with the previous year. 
In 1993 they sold 28-45 percent of the total produce sold 
through free channels (the market, own stores, public catering 
outlets, and so forth) (in 1992 the figure was 24-27 percent). 
  Stockraising in 1993 was characterized by a decline in the 
receipt of produce from agricultural enterprises' farms and a 
simultaneous increase in production on citizens' private 
subsidiary plots. On farms of all categories meat production 
fell by 860,000 tonnes in live weight (a 7-percent reduction) 
compared with 1992, egg production was down 2.6 billion (6 
percent), and wool production was down 18,500 tonnes (10 
percent). The decline in milk production has been halted: 
Production was at the previous year's level. 
  As of 1 January 1994 the number of livestock on all 
categories of farms was 48.9 million head (6 percent less than 
on the same date in 1993), the cow herd totaled 19.8 million (2 
percent down), there were 28.5 million hogs (10 percent down) 
and 43.6 million sheep and goats (15 percent fewer). At the 
same time the herd on the population's plots increased as 
follows: beef cattle [krupnyy rogatyy skot] -- 4 percent, dairy 
cattle [korova] -- 6 percent, and pigs -- 2 percent. 
  The proportion of beef cattle owned by citizens rose in the 
last three years from 17 percent to 25 percent, of dairy cattle 
from 25 percent to 34 percent, of hogs from 18 percent to 28 
percent, and of sheep and goats from 28 percent to 38 percent. 
  Insufficient and unbalanced feed was the main reason for the 
poor use of the potential of livestock. Livestock productivity 
in Russia remains two-three times below the genetic potential 
and equivalent indicators for developed foreign countries. 
  Volumes of state purchases of livestock and poultry were 5.9 
million tonnes in 1993 (85 percent of the 1992 level), milk -- 
24.6 million tonnes (94 percent), and eggs -- 24.2 billion (99.5 
percent). The proportion of state purchases in the total volume 
of livestock product sales by agricultural commodity producers 
remained virtually unchanged at 80-90 percent in comparison with 
the previous year. 
<H5>  Transport and Communications </H5>
  In 1993 the reduction of freight shipments was a consequence 
of the continuing decline in the production of output. The 
volume of freight shipments by general-purpose transport fell by 
1.2 billion tonnes in comparison with 1992 (down by 25 percent) 
and totaled 3.6 billion tonnes. Freight shipment by rail fell 
by 18 percent, road transport was down 40 percent, maritime 
transport was down 8 percent, inland water transport was down 31 
percent, air transport was down 23 percent, and pipeline 
transport was down 8 percent. 
  The shipment of freight by general-use inland water 
transport 
to the Far North and equivalent locations ended in October. 
From the start of the navigation season 35 million tonnes of 
freight were shipped to those regions by river transport, which 
is 24 percent less than in 1992, and around 8 million tonnes 
were shipped by sea (28 percent less). 
  The number of passengers carried by general-use transport 
fell 5 percent compared with 1992. A proportion of passenger 
traffic was switched to relatively cheaper rail transport, where 
passenger numbers increased by 7 percent. Road passenger 
traffic fell by 6 percent, inland water passenger traffic fell 
16 percent, and air passenger traffic was down 29 percent. In 
air transport passenger traffic on internal routes was down 37 
percent whereas on international routes it rose by 29 percent. 
  Public transport rolling stock is in bad technical 
condition. 
At least one-tenth of the registered fleet of passenger cars and 
street cars and trolleys are being used beyond the end of their 
operational life. At general-use motor transport establishments 
almost one third of buses have depreciated completely and are 
due to be written off. The constantly rising transport tariffs 
do not cover the costs of transport enterprises and do not 
enable them to update the vehicle fleet. As a result the number 
of vehicles in use on the roads is falling and routes are being 
canceled or reduced. In December one regional center in four 
failed to fulfill more than 15 percent of planned bus, trolley, 
and street car journeys. Public taxi transport has become 
virtually unaffordable for the population and the volume of 
journeys halved over the year. 
  The quality of passenger services remains low. In 1993, 32 
million bus journeys were canceled and 4.7 million buses were 
late arriving at their final destination. Some 27 percent of 
internal flights failed to keep to schedule, and the average 
delay was over five hours. In rail transport in 1993, 36,000 
trains (8 percent) (leaving aside suburban trains) were late on 
average 1.1 hours. 
  The year 1993 saw the further development of communications 
networks and facilities, and this applies first and foremost to 
intercity and international telephone communications. An 
international telephone complex has been launched. A 24-hour 
outgoing automatic exchange has been opened for all subscribers 
in Moscow and St. Petersburg. In 70 cities in Russia 
international high-speed postal communications services are 
being offered. At the same time, a check carried out by the 
statistical organs has revealed substantial violations of the 
delivery deadlines. 
  Over the year communications enterprises provided services 
worth R1.6 trillion, including services to the population 
totaling R314 billion, which is 12 times more in actual current 
prices than in 1992. At the same time the volume of 
communications services in real terms continues to decline. In 
comparison with 1992 the number of letters and printed items 
sent fell by 24 percent, parcel traffic fell by 45 percent, 
money transfers, newspapers, and magazines (subscription and 
retail sales) were down by 31 percent, and telegrams were down 
17 percent. 
  More than 11 million applications for the installation of 
domestic telephones remain unsatisfied. The problem of 
providing the population with a telephone service is aggravated 
by the fact that in a number of cases citizens have been forced 
to forego the installation of a telephone on grounds of cost. 
<H5>  The Consumer Market </H5>
  Last year the trade and services sphere adapted increasingly 
to the new conditions. Enterprise is gaining momentum in the 
consumer market. In 1993 the population bought goods and 
services through all forms of sale worth R65.2 trillion (the 
statistics on the volume of sales of consumer goods and services 
to the population are cited on the basis of an expert assessment 
of volumes of sales at nonregistered enterprises and also in the 
light of the informal import and sale of consumer goods by 
private individuals), which in actual prices is 10.7 times 
higher than in 1992 and in comparable prices is virtually at the 
1992 level (a reduction of 0.5 percent). Around 40 percent of 
this volume constitutes expenditure on the acquisition of 
consumer goods and services in informal trading. 
  In comparison with 1992 the supply of goods to the retail 
trade network increased. Whereas in 1992 the retail 
availability coefficient was approximately 50 percent for food 
products and 70 percent for nonfood goods, in 1993 it was equal 
to 60-70 percent and 80-90 percent. The retail trade commodity 
supply index fluctuated around the 120-130 percent level 
compared with 1992. 
  Private-sector (including consumer cooperative) trade's 
share 
of retail commodity turnover was 71 percent (62 percent in 
1992), the state sector formed 25 percent (37 percent), and 
other nonstate forms of ownership made up 4 percent (1 percent). 
  In 1993 the population bought foodstuffs worth R31.3 
trillion. A proportion of the population is moving from 
organized trade to informal trade for the purchase of 
foodstuffs: In a number of instances prices are lower in 
informal trade. For example, while purchases of meat products, 
sugar, and vegetable oil rose by 12-26 percent and dairy 
products by 6 percent, in the organized trade sector sales fell 
by 4-15 percent. 
  The enforced redistribution of the population's money 
incomes 
in favor of the purchase of foodstuffs in 1992 restricted demand 
in the nonfood goods market. As money incomes rose and the 
population adapted to the new prices in 1993 a definite change 
occurred in the structure of retail commodity turnover; the 
proportion of food goods fell from 55 percent to 53 percent, 
while nonfood goods rose from 45 percent to 47 percent. In 1993 
the population bought nonfood goods worth R27.5 trillion, which 
in real prices is 11 times higher than in 1992. There was an 
increase in demand for many light industry products. In 
conditions when the production of these goods by our country's 
industry fell, the supply to the consumer market was largely 
maintained by means of expensive products and an increase in 
foreign purchases by commercial structures. 
  In comparison with 1992 purchases of footwear, knitted 
underwear, hosiery, cotton goods, woollens, and silk fabrics 
increased (1.1 to 1.5 times). Demand for domestic equipment was 
maintained. The sale of TV sets, refrigerators, freezers, and 
radio sets in organized trade rose by 19-26 percent. 
  In 1993 the population received paid services worth R6.4 
trillion, which in real prices is 12 times higher than the 1992 
level but in comparable prices is 30 percent lower. The volume 
of sales of domestic services was R1.1 trillion, which in real 
terms is 38 percent down on 1992. 
<H5>  Foreign Economic Ties With Non-CIS Countries </H5>
  In 1993 Russia's foreign trade turnover (excluding CIS 
countries) including the import and export of goods by private 
individuals was $70 billion or a reduction of 12 percent in 
current prices compared with 1992. 
  Exports amounted to $43 billion, an increase of 1.4 percent, 
and the breakdown was as follows: to the industrially developed 
countries -- $25 billion (an increase of 1.2 percent); to the 
developing countries -- $6 billion (an increase of 39 percent); 
and the rest of the world (the former CEMA countries, the former 
Yugoslav republics, China, the DPRK, and the Baltic countries) 
-- $12 billion (a reduction of 5 percent). 
  The main volumes of export deliveries in 1993 went to 
Germany 
-- $5.8 billion (97 percent of 1992's figure); China -- $3.3 
billion (118 percent); Italy -- $2.8 billion (93 percent); 
Britain -- $2 billion (92 percent); Hungary -- $2.1 billion (138 
percent); Japan -- $2 billion (130 percent); the United States 
-- $2.0 billion (267 percent); France -- $1.8 billion (87 
percent); Czech Republic -- $1.6 billion (90 percent); Finland 
-- $1.6 billion (96 percent); Austria -- $1.5 billion (210 
percent); and Switzerland -- $1.5 billion (168 percent). 
  Fuel and energy resources accounted for 48 percent of the 
export commodity structure in 1993, with crude oil accounting 
for 19.1 percent, natural gas for 17.0 percent, and petroleum 
products for 8.0 percent, while machinery and equipment 
accounted for 6.7 percent of the total export volume. 
  In 1993 Russia's imports were worth $27 billion, 27 percent 
down on 1992, including $16.4 billion from the industrially 
developed countries (down 31 percent), $2.9 billion from the 
developing countries (down 39 percent) and $7.7 billion from the 
remaining countries (11 percent down on 1992). 
  Imports from Germany were worth $6.6 billion (96 percent of 
the 1992 figure), China -- $4.1 billion (228 percent) Japan -- 
$1.5 billion (89 percent), the United States -- $1.5 billion (52 
percent), France -- $1.2 billion (90 percent), and Italy -- $1.0 
billion (34 percent). Volumes of imports from Belgium, Britain, 
the Netherlands, Turkey, and Switzerland rose. Purchase of 
output in such countries as Bulgaria, Canada, the Republic of 
Korea, Romania, Singapore, and Sweden fell to half or less. 
  Machinery and equipment accounted for 26.5 percent of the 
total import volume in 1993, grain accounted for 5.8 percent, 
textiles and knitwear accounted for 4.5 percent, and sugar 
(including raw sugar) 3.0 percent. 
  In 1993 the foreign trade balance showed a surplus of $16.0 
billion (in 1992 the surplus was $5.4 billion). 
<H5>  Foreign Economic Ties with Neighboring Foreign Countries </H5>
  In accordance with intergovernmental agreements concluded by 
Russia with the former Union republics, a definite mechanism of 
trade and economic relations was formed between them which 
operated in 1993. However, the crisis state of the economy, the 
fall in production, and the reorientation of enterprises' 
economic ties toward the rest of the world caused a further 
decline in Russia's commodity turnover with the CIS states. 
Foreign trade turnover with the neighboring foreign countries 
in 1993 was R22.5 trillion or only 50 percent of the 1991 level. 
In the same period Russian oil deliveries to the CIS states 
fell by 60 percent, natural gas supplies were down by 8 percent, 
coal was down 68 percent, motor gasoline was down 60 percent, 
and rolled metals were down 64 percent. Russia's priority 
export commodity is fuel resources (88 percent of the volume of 
production and technical output exported as against 51 percent 
in 1992). 
  In 1993 the total commodity turnover volume with the CIS 
countries using the mechanism of equivalent supplies on a 
balanced basis in which payments are made using the price level 
in the world market, was almost $7 billion. 
  The CIS states' debt to Russia converted into 
[pereoformlennaya v] state debt was R2.3 trillion (approximately 
U.S. $5 billion). The possibility of settling part of the debt 
by the transfer of property rights (shares, securities, and so 
forth) to enterprises and installations of interest to Russia is 
envisaged here. 
  The total debt of enterprises and organizations of the CIS 
countries for supplies of goods under direct ties from Russia 
amounted to around R3.5 trillion by the end of 1993 of which 
approximately R1.5 trillion constituted debts to enterprises in 
Russia's fuel and energy complex. 
  The partial settlement of these debts is being achieved by 
state credits granted by Russia to the CIS countries. In 
addition, when payments are made it is anticipated that broader 
use will be made of payments in national currencies based on the 
quoted exchange rate for those currencies. 
<H5>  Privatization </H5>
  In January-November 39,000 state enterprises were 
privatized, 
and since privatization in Russia began 86,000 enterprises have 
been privatized. Of the total number of enterprises privatized 
in the first 11 months of 1993, 31 percent have passed into 
private ownership by means of flotation (partial or complete), 
69 percent by sale. 
  Retail and wholesale trade enterprises account for 35 
percent 
of the total privatized, industrial enterprises for 29 percent, 
consumer services enterprises for 18 percent, construction 
enterprises for 9 percent, public catering enterprises for 7 
percent, road transport enterprises for 3 percent, and 
agricultural enterprises for 2 percent. 
  The total value of enterprises privatized in January-October 
(according to residual value in prices prior to the revaluation 
of fixed assets in 1992) was over R753 billion. 
  On average the value of a single privatized enterprise in 
municipal ownership was R12 million, in territorial ownership -- 
R16 million, and in federal ownership -- R54 million. 
  Of the three forms of concessions offered to labor 
collectives during flotation of enterprises the preference, as 
before, is for option two, which enables the labor collective to 
own the controling stake. That option has been chosen by over 
three-quarters of enterprises which have become joint-stock. 
One-sixth of enterprises opted for flotation version three and 
around 1 percent have opted for version one. In addition, a 
proportion of enterprises (3.3 percent) have opted for flotation 
as lease enterprises. 
  The privatization of large and medium enterprises is being 
accomplished mainly by flotation. Of those enterprises 
privatized by flotation in January-November the controlling 
stake is assigned to the state at 305 of them (2.7 percent), and 
the state retains a "golden" share at a further 158 enterprises 
(1.4 percent). Of the total number of such enterprises the 
majority are in industry (54 percent) and in construction (12 
percent). 
  Privatization of small-scale enterprises is carried out as a 
rule by sale and virtually without restriction from the state. 
Some 44 percent of enterprises have been sold off by competitive 
tender, 43 percent by buy-outs of leased property, and 9 percent 
of enterprises by auction. 
  The average value rating [kurs stoimosti] of the enterprises 
which have been sold (the ratio of sale price to initial price) 
in January-November was 5.7 (in 1992 the figure was 3.2); for 
enterprises in municipal ownership the figure was 7.2, in 
territorial ownership -- 3.8, and in federal ownership -- 2.3. 
  Of those enterprises which have been floated 13 percent have 
sold all the shares available for sale, and of those enterprises 
privatized by means of sale more than three-quarters have paid 
the whole purchase sum due under contract. 
  The privatization of enterprises in January-November 
produced 
R340 billion (including resources for enterprises privatized in 
1992) and 40 million privatization checks. 
  The privatization of enterprises in municipal ownership 
generated R181 billion (53 percent of the money received) and 
6.2 million checks (16 percent of the total number of 
privatization checks redeemed), those in territorial ownership 
raised R56 billion (17 percent) and 9.6 million checks (24 
percent) correspondingly, and those in federal ownership raised 
R103 billion (30 percent) and 24.2 million checks (60 percent). 
Of the money raised 64 percent has been transferred to the 
budgets of the territories as revenue, 20 percent to the federal 
budget, and 16 percent to the state privatization organs. 
<H5>  Development of Market Structures </H5>
  The development of the Russian Federation's market 
infrastructure is undergoing a certain change at the moment. A 
gradual reduction in the number of commodity exchanges is being 
noticed. Out of the 303 licensed exchanges around 180 were in 
operation at the end of 1993, 40 of which were doing stable work 
and held auctions twice or more a week. 
  The bulk of the commodity turnover at exchanges (40 percent) 
is accounted for by the six largest exchanges, four of which are 
in Moscow and one each in Saratov and Omsk. 
  According to the preliminary figures, total commodity 
exchange turnover in 1993 amounted to R1.6 trillion, which was 
4.5 times higher than the 1992 turnover in current prices. The 
proportion of production and technical output in the structure 
of commodity exchange turnover fell (from 65 percent to 41 
percent) and consumer goods fell (from 31 percent to 12 percent). 
  In 1993 contracts began to be concluded for the purchase and 
sale of future supplies of output, which represented 6 percent 
of the total annual turnover. 
  Individual exchanges began to specialize in the sale of 
certain commodities. During the year 70 percent of commodity 
exchange business in oil was conducted at the Moscow Petroleum 
Exchange, 60 percent of dealings in wheat were conducted at the 
Russian Grain Exchange (Saratov), almost 50 percent of the coal 
was sold at the Siberian Commodity Exchange (Novosibirsk), 75 
percent of the nickel and over 40 percent of the aluminum were 
traded at the Moscow Nonferrous Metals Exchange, and 40 percent 
of trading in timber was handled at the "Roslesbirzha" (Moscow). 
However, the volumes of commodity dealings in the production of 
that output remain insignificant, ranging from 0.1 percent to 
1.5 percent. 
  Operations involving money and securities expanded at stock 
exchanges. The volume of their sales in total stock exchange 
turnover rose from 3 percent in 1992 to 46 percent in 1993. 
  By the end of 1993 around 2,000 commercial and cooperative 
banks holding Bank of Russia operating licenses, plus around 
4,000 branches (excluding the Savings Bank of the Russian 
Federation), had been registered. 
  In 1993 there were approximately 1.4 commercial banks per 
100,000 inhabitants: If branches of the Savings Bank are 
included that figure is 25-30 banking establishments per 100,000 
inhabitants. 
  The density of commercial banks by individual regions of 
Russia varies. Moscow remains the leader in terms of the 
provision of banking services. According to the figures for the 
first half-year, 38 percent of all registered banks and their 
branches are concentrated in the capital and Moscow has more 
than 22 commercial banks and branches per 100,000 inhabitants. 
In the Far East region and Kaliningrad Oblast the figure is 
four to six banks each, elsewhere the figure is one to two banks. 
  Of the total number of commercial banks around one-third 
have 
been organized on the basis of former specialist banks and over 
60 percent are new formed. 
  Commercial banks account for 80 percent of total credit 
investments in the national economy. 
  The traditional source of resources for the commercial banks 
-- funds which they manage to attract [privlechennyye sredstva] 
-- remains the main one (over 90 percent of liabilities), of 
which the resources of enterprises and organizations in clearing 
[raschetnyy] accounts and current and other accounts, deposits, 
and investments account for 25-27 percent of liabilities and 
interbank credits account for less than one fifth. Centralized 
credits of the Bank of Russia are prevalent in the latter 
category. 
  The main directions in the use of bank resources are the 
provision of credit (over one-third of assets were used for 
this) and investments in foreign operations (around one-half of 
assets). 
  The insurance services market in 1992-1993 saw an active 
process of forming a competitive environment. The formation and 
development of this market is an important factor ensuring 
stability in the activity of economic players and citizens' 
property interests. 
  In October 1993 the Russian State Committee for Statistics 
carried out a one-shot survey of the activity of 900 Russian 
insurance organizations (constituting 89 percent of the total 
number of firms with licenses to carry out insurance activity). 
Most of them -- over three-fourths -- are closed-type 
joint-stock companies and limited-liability partnerships, while 
one-sixth are open-type joint-stock companies. Firms in mixed 
ownership predominate -- 49 percent of the total number of firms 
-- 36 percent are in private ownership, 10 percent are in state 
ownership, and 5 percent are in municipal ownership or are owned 
by public organizations. 
  Most of the companies (69 percent of the survey sample) are 
small firms with incorporation capital of up to R10 million, and 
23 percent have incorporation capital of under R2 million. 
  The main clients of insurance companies among corporate 
entities are industrial (49 percent), agricultural (23 percent), 
and trading and intermediary and construction (9 percent) 
organizations and enterprises. 
  Priorities have emerged on the insurance market in forms of 
insurance between state and nonstate companies. State firms 
mostly carry out operations to provide long-term life insurance 
(75 percent), insure citizens' property (85 percent), and 
provide mandatory medical insurance (83 percent), while nonstate 
companies carry out operations to provide life insurance for 
terms of under a year (87 percent), voluntary medical insurance 
(96 percent), and liability insurance (90 percent). 
<H5>  Prices </H5>
  Prices of consumer goods and paid services in 1993 increased 
9.4 times over December 1992, including 9.0 times for foodstuffs 
(including alcoholic beverages), 7.4 times for nonfood goods, 
and 24.1 times for paid services to the population. Prices in 
city markets increased 9 times, including 8.5 times for 
plant-growing products and 10 times for livestock products. 
  The dynamics of inflation processes over 1993 were as 
follows. In the first half of 1993 the composite consumer prices 
index dropped from 126 percent in January to 118 percent in May. 
However, the inflation rate again began to pick up at the start 
of the second six months. In July the rate of increase in 
consumer prices was 122 percent, and in August 126 percent. In 
the fall the rate of price increases slowed and was 123 percent 
in September, 120 percent in October, 116 percent in November, 
and 113 percent in December. 
  In 1993 the rates of increase in consumer prices and prices 
for producer enterprises were similar. The prices of producers 
of industrial output increased 10 times compared with December 
1992, and prices of agricultural output increased on average 8.5 
times over the period. Prices for capital investments increased 
11.6 times, including 11.9 times for construction and 
installation work. 
<H5>  Finances </H5>
  Implementation of the Russian Federation consolidated budget 
for 1993 is expected to be R53 trillion for income and R64 
trillion for expenditure. The budget deficit will remain around 
R11 trillion (7 percent of GDP) and will increase more than 18 
times over 1992, despite only a 10-fold growth rate in inflation. 
  In 1993, unlike 1992, the greatest proportion of the income 
of the consolidated budget is made up of profits tax -- 35 
percent (29 percent in 1992). The increase in revenue from this 
tax is largely due to the general growth in nominal profits. 
  The decrease in the proportion of consolidated budget income 
yielded by revenue from value-added tax (from 38 percent to 25 
percent) in 1993 is due to the reduction in the rate of 
value-added tax from 28 percent to 20 percent and to 10 percent 
for food goods as of 1 January 1993. 
  The proportion of the consolidated budget income yielded by 
income from foreign economic activity and duties in 1993 
remained at the same level as the previous year -- 9 and 4 
percent respectively. 
  The main spheres of financing in 1993, as in 1992, were the 
national economy -- 30 percent of total spending, not counting 
loans and resources transferred in mutual settlements (35 
percent in 1992) -- and sociocultural measures: 27 percent (24 
percent in 1992). 
  The proportion of expenditure on maintaining organs of state 
power, management, and law enforcement and also on defense 
remained practically unchanged at around 7 and 13 percent 
respectively. 
  Federal budget income for 1993 (estimated) totaled R29.4 
trillion. The federal budget deficit, under the influence of 
indexation of the main expenditure headings and the 
implementation of new, unplanned expenditure, reached over R12 
trillion (7 percent of GDP). 
  Federal budget income accounts for 50 percent of the total 
income of the Russian Federation's consolidated budget; within 
this figure, profits tax for 1993 accounts for around 34 percent 
of the relevant heading in the consolidated budget, value-added 
tax accounts for 65 percent, income from foreign economic 
activity accounts for over 96 percent, and duties account for 53 
percent. 
  Federal budget expenditure accounts for over 51 percent of 
total consolidated budget expenditure (not counting resources 
transferred under mutual settlements, budget loans, and 
subventions). Federal budget expenditure on the national 
economy in 1993 accounts for over 28 percent of the relevant 
heading of expenditure in the consolidated budget, and 
sociocultural measures account for 19 percent. 
  Credit investments in the national economy totaled R30.5 
trillion as of the start of 1994 and increased six times over 
the start of 1993; as a percentage of GDP they totaled 19 
percent as of the start of 1994 as against 28 percent as of the 
start of 1993. 
  In view of the continuing inflation lending is short-term. 
In 1993 there was a decrease in the proportion of long-term 
credits granted for periods of over a year. They decreased from 
5 percent of the total credit investment in the first quarter to 
3 percent by the end of the year. The average term of a loan is 
two or three months. In March 1993 loans for terms of up to two 
months accounted for 66 percent of the total amount of credit 
placed on the stock market, in June they accounted for 98 
percent, and in September they accounted for 99 percent. 
  With a view to weakening the inflationary influence of 
central credits on the economy the state took measures to limit 
the growth in the money supply and credit. Preferential credits 
(the difference between interest rates and the Bank of Russia 
rate was formerly covered from the budget) were abolished from 
October 1993. The granting of technical credits to the CIS 
countries was ended (they were redesignated as interstate 
credits and included in the state debt). The Bank of Russia 
discount rate (refinancing rate) was revised. In 1993 it rose 
six times and since 15 October has remained at the level of 210 
percent. 
  The Russian Federation Savings Bank has over 70 percent of 
the population's accounts. According to operational data as of 
1 January 1994, 212.2 million investors had deposits there 
totaling R3,055.9 billion. The average deposit was R14,400 
(R3,200 as of 1 January 1993). 
  In 1993 commercial banks, seeking spare resources, actively 
attracted resources from private investors and shareholders. 
The balances in the population's accounts in these banks 
increased on average by 31 percent per month; the corresponding 
figure for the Savings Bank was 14 percent. A considerable 
contribution to this was made by the higher interest rate on 
investments and deposits in most commercial banks compared with 
the Russian Savings Bank. 
  Interest rates on investments and deposits in the Russian 
Federation Savings Bank in 1993 rose in April and October for 
current accounts from 20 percent to 40 percent, for fixed-term 
deposits from 60 percent to 120 percent, for special-purpose 
deposits for children from 80 percent to 190 percent, and for 
deposits according to term and amount from 80-90 percent to 
120-150 percent. New types of deposits for sums between 
R500,000 and R1 million and terms of six months or a year were 
introduced, and as of the end of 1993 the interest rates on them 
were 120 percent and 160 percent; for some of over R1 million 
and R5 million the rates were 170 percent and 180 percent 
respectively for a one-year term. 
<H5>  Population's Living Standard and Incomes </H5>
  The population's money incomes, boosted by the incomes of 
people engaged in entrepreneurial activity, totaled R78.3 
trillion in 1993, an 11-fold increase over 1992. Here 73 
percent of the growth in incomes came from increased earnings, 
16 percent was attributable to social payments, and other income 
accounted for 11 percent. 
  Money incomes taking account of the consumer price index 
increased 9 percent, while disposable money incomes increased 10 
percent. 
  In family income patterns revenue from state and cooperative 
organizations fell from 78 to 74 percent, social payments rose 
from 13 to 15 percent, and other income (from the sale of 
produce, livestock, and buildings and craft work) rose from 9 to 
11 percent. 
  For the bulk of the population wages are the main source of 
money income. In December 1993 the average wage in Russian 
economic sectors totaled R141,200, an increase of 39 percent 
over November. 
  Average monthly wages in December totaled R145,700 in 
industry, R194,900 in construction, R88,700 in agriculture, 
R112,500 in health care, physical culture, and social welfare, 
R98,300 in education, R84,900 in culture and art, and R95,300 in 
science and scientific services. 
  In December 1993 approximately half of all working people 
had 
wages below the Russian average. Around 2 percent of working 
people had wages lower than the minimum wage (R14,620). At the 
end of the year the average wage of the highest-paid 10 percent 
of working people was 27 times that of the lowest-paid 10 
percent. 
  The size of pension payments was revised quarterly 
throughout 
1993. The minimum old-age pension increased from R2,250 in 
January to R26,320 in December 1993 (taking compensation 
payments into account). It is estimated that as of 1 January 
1994 the average size of a designated monthly pension totaled 
R39,400, including the old-age pension of R41,400. 
  The stratification of society into rich and poor is 
proceeding rapidly. Currently the incomes of the most affluent 
10 percent are 11 times greater than the incomes of the least 
affluent 10 percent, whereas the correlation was 7.5-8 times at 
the end of 1992 and 4.5 times in 1991. By the end of 1993, 33 
million people (22 percent of the total population) had average 
per capita monthly incomes lower than the subsistence minimum. 
(The subsistence minimum is calculated on the basis of a Russian 
Federation Ministry of Labor methodology taking account of the 
sex and age mix of the population. Under this methodology the 
subsistence minimum includes: expenditure on food products 
calculated on the basis of the minimum consumption levels 
defined by the Nutrition Institute of the Russian Academy of 
Medical Sciences, the Institute of Socioeconomic Problems of the 
Population of the Russian Academy of Sciences, and the Russian 
Ministry of Labor; expenditure on nonfood products and services; 
and also taxes and compulsory payments, based on the expenditure 
patterns of the least affluent 10 percent of families). In 
December it totaled R42,800 per capita, including R48,400 for 
the work-capable population, R30,200 for pensioners, and R42,800 
for children. 
  Differentiation among the population in terms of property is 
less substantial than for incomes. According to figures from a 
Russia-wide survey of households, families with incomes below 
the subsistence minimum have 8 percent fewer refrigerators, 11 
percent fewer washing machines, 26 percent fewer color 
television sets, 20 percent fewer sewing machines, and 25 
percent fewer tape players and wall units than other families. 
  In 1993 the population of Russia spent a total of R53.8 
trillion on purchasing goods and services -- up 10.4 times in 
comparison with 1992 -- and R6.3 trillion on taxes and 
contributions -- up 10.2 times; while the growth of savings on 
deposit and in securities and of spending on the purchase of 
foreign currency totaled R10.9 trillion -- up 32.2 times. 
  The population's income exceeded its expenditure by R7.3 
trillion. At the end of 1993 residual money in hand (adjusted 
for cash held by commercial organizations) exceeded R8.4 
trillion. 
  Some 46 percent of the population's consumer spending went 
on 
food (47 percent in 1992), 44 percent went on nonfood products 
(41 percent in 1992), and 7.5 percent went on services (7.7 
percent). 
  In 1993 there was a change of trend in the dynamics of the 
population's consumption of basic food products. Whereas 1992 
had seen a decline in per capita consumption of meat, dairy, and 
fish products and fruit and vegetable produce, 1993 saw 
something of a return to the previous consumption level. 
<H5>  The Population's Employment </H5>
  In 1993 71 million people, or 48 percent of the total 
population, were employed in Russia's economy. The nonstate 
sector, in which more than 40 percent of working people are now 
employed, is starting to play an increasingly large role. 
  The numbers of working people in the main sectors of the 
social complex -- public education and health care -- increased 
in 1993 compared with 1992. The numbers of people working in 
credit provision and state insurance, in tax inspectorates, in 
notarial offices and legal services are growing steadily -- 
which attests to the start of the formation of an infrastructure 
characteristic of a market economy. At the same time there has 
been a drop in the numbers employed in science and scientific 
services and in planning and planning-surveying organizations. 
  By the end of 1993 the total number of persons out of work 
and actively seeking it, as well as persons working part-time 
(potentially unemployed), stood at 7.8 million, or 10.4 percent 
of the economically active population. Of these, 3.8 million 
people (5.1 percent) are classified as unemployed in accordance 
with ILO methodology. Some 0.8 million people, or 1.1 percent 
of the economically active population, have official unemployed 
status. 
  The average coefficient in Russia for the number of 
unemployed persons seeking work per vacancy in employment 
services stands at 3.1. 
  The labor market situation merits special attention in the 
republics of Mari El, Dagestan, Chuvashia, Adygea, and Mordovia 
and in Pskov, Yaroslavl, and Ivanovo Oblasts, where, given the 
high level of unemployment, the opportunities for finding work 
for the unemployed population are limited. In these regions 
between 16 and 33 people chase every job on offer at at the 
employment office, and 54 people in the Republic of Mari El. 
  Territorial and professional-qualificational disproportions 
in the supply and demand for manpower on the labor market are 
manifested in growing unemployment in a stagnant form. There 
has been an increase in the proportion of people who have been 
unemployed for more than four months; by the end of the first 
quarter of 1993 they made up 42 percent of the total number of 
unemployed, and now they make up approximately 56 percent. The 
proportion of citizens for whom work has been found within the 
total number of those seeking work is practically unchanged (6-8 
percent each month). 
  The problem of unemployment is most acute for women 
(approximately 70 percent of the officially registered 
unemployed). 
  As of 1 October 1993, 1.1 million people (3.3 percent of 
working people) were working an incomplete work week in 
industry, construction, transport, communications, domestic 
services for the population, science, and scientific services in 
1993. During the period since the beginning of the year 3.7 
million people took unpaid or partly paid vacations on the 
management's initiative. 
  The largest scale of partial unemployment was observed in 
enterprises of the textile industry, tractor and agricultural 
and diesel machine building, and the electrical engineering 
industry, where between 40 and 60 percent of employees took 
additional vacations or were transferred to an incomplete work 
week. 
  In 1993 strikes lasting one day or more were recorded at 265 
enterprises, establishments, and organizations in Russia -- four 
times fewer than in 1992. A premeditated cessation of work was 
noted primarily in enterprises and organizations of the fuel 
industry, transport, communications, and construction. In 1993 
there was a shortfall of output worth almost R8 billion in 
connection with strikes. The largest number of strikes was 
noted in March, in August-September, and during the last two 
months of the year. 
  The main reasons for mass absenteeism and work stoppages 
owing to strikes were delays over paying wages, demands for a 
wage increase, and failure to fulfill tariff agreements. There 
were strikes for these reasons in 21 regions of the country. 
<H5>  The Housing Problem </H5>
  Approximately 10 million Russian families (19 percent of the 
total number, of whom 1.3 million families -- 13 percent -- have 
been waiting for housing for 10 years or more) are currently 
standing in line to obtain housing in Russia. 
  Some 4.5 million people (3.0 percent) are living in communal 
apartments, and 6.5 million people (4.4 percent) in hostels. 
More than 20 percent of the housing stock is not provided with 
a water supply, a sewer system, centralized heating, or gas. 
<H5>  Education </H5>
  In 1993 daytime general educational schools in the state 
network were attended by 20.6 million pupils, which corresponds 
to 100.4 percent in relation to 1992, while preschool 
establishments were attended by 6.6 million children (91 
percent). Higher and secondary specialized educational 
institutions were attended by 2.5 million and 2.0 million 
students respectively, and in 1993 they trained 444,000 and 
547,000 specialists. 
  In the 1993-1994 academic year 95,000 students are studying 
on conditions of full reimbursement of costs (49,000 in the 
1992-1993 academic year). 
  The problem of finding work for graduates of schools, 
vocational and technical schools, technical colleges, and VUZ's 
[higher educational institutions] has been exacerbated. In 
1993, owing to a lack of applications and to employers' 
rejections of graduates for whom applications had been made 
earlier, 55,000 VUZ graduates (20 percent) and 124,600 graduates 
of secondary specialized educational institutions (33 percent) 
did not receive a posting to a job. 
  Alternative education was developing in many regions of the 
Russian Federation in 1993. At the start of the current 
academic year more than 300 lycees (over 200,000 pupils) and 
approximately 600 grammar schools (over 400,000 pupils) were 
functioning. There were 368 nonstate general educational 
schools (0.5 percent of the total number of schools), attended 
by 33,000 pupils (0.2 percent). 
<H5>  Demographic Situation </H5>
  During 1993 the country's population fell by 300,000, or by 
0.2 percent, and stood at 148.4 million by the beginning of 
1994. This was a consequence of unfavorable processes with 
regard to the birth and death rates, determined not only by the 
contemporary situation but also by the nature of demographic 
development in the past. Some 1.4 million babies were born in 
1993 -- 226,000 or 14 percent fewer than in 1992. The birth 
rate indicator per 1,000 of the population fell correspondingly 
from 10.7 to 9.2. 
  The number of deaths during the year increased by 360,000, 
or 
20 percent, and stood at 2.2 million, while the overall death 
rate indicator per 1,000 inhabitants increased to 14.6 from 
12.2; at the same time 348,000 people died from traumas and 
poisonings -- 40 percent more than in 1992. 
  The death rate for the population of able-bodied age grew at 
a preferential rate and increased by one-third over the year, 
while the proportion of persons of this age in the total number 
of those who died increased to 30 percent from 27 percent in 
1992. 
  Unfavorable changes in the birth and death rates led to an 
increase in the population's natural diminution: 800,000 or 60 
percent more deaths were registered than births (in 1992 there 
had been 220,000 or 14 percent more). 
<H5>  Ecological Situation </H5>
  In 1993 there was a certain reduction in the discharge of 
pollutants into the atmosphere and water expanses, connected 
mainly with the decline in industrial production. 
  An extremely high level of pollution of water expanses (100 
and more times in excess of maximum permissible norms) was 
observed in Sverdlovsk, Perm, Chelyabinsk, Murmansk, Orenburg, 
Kemerovo, and Kaliningrad oblasts. The greatest pollution in 
terms of the number of incidents and the quantity of components 
was recorded in the Volga basin with the Oka and Kama 
tributaries and in the Ob basin with the Irtysh and Tobol 
tributaries. 
  Discharge of pollutants into the atmosphere declined, 
according to estimates, by over 10 percent compared with 1992. 
Instances of extremely high pollution of the atmosphere were 
not recorded. But every month pollutants were noted in the 
atmosphere of 10-20 cities in concentrations 10 and more times 
in excess of the norm. This occurred most frequently in Moscow, 
Omsk, Dzerzhinsk, Novorossiysk, Ufa, Kemerovo, Samara, Norilsk, 
and Komsomolsk-na-Amure. 
<H5>  Crime </H5>
  In 1993 there were 2.8 million crimes recorded (101.4 
percent 
of the 1992 level) including 29,200 premeditated murders (127 
percent), 66,900 (124 percent) cases of premeditated grievous 
bodily harm, 184,000 thefts, (112 percent), 40,200 robberies 
(132 percent), and 14,400 (106 percent) cases of aggravated rape. 
  As before the most widespread forms of crime were thefts of 
state and public property (516,000, a reduction of 7 percent) 
and of citizens' personal property (1.064 million, a reduction 
of 3 percent). The proportion of these types of crime in the 
overall figure of recorded crimes rose from 50 percent in 1990 
to 56 percent in 1993. 
  There is an increase in the scale of the illegal circulation 
of arms. The number of thefts of weapons and ammunition in 1993 
compared with 1992 increased 23 percent, with 1,396 cases. Some 
22,100 crimes were committed with the use of firearms, 
ammunition, and explosives. 
  Over the year 53,200 crimes connected with narcotics and 
substances with powerful effects (an 80-percent increase 
compared with 1992) including 912 large-scale crimes (a twofold 
increase). About 20 tonnes of narcotics and substances with 
powerful effects were confiscated from criminals, as were 118 
tonnes of plants with a narcotics content. 
  In the economic sphere 110,000 crimes were detected. Almost 
one third (37,300) consisted of thefts through misappropriation, 
embezzlement, and the abuse of official positions. The number 
of detected cases of bribery rose 35 percent. 
  Over 1993 the law enforcement organs uncovered 1.3 million 
people who had committed crimes (10 percent more than in 1992). 
Every third criminal had committed a crime in a group and every 
other criminal had committed a crime while drunk. 
  The spread of crime in Russia was 1,883 crimes per 100,000 
members of the population (in 1992 the figure was 1,857 crimes). 
The crime detection rate increased from 47 percent in 1992 to 51 
percent in 1993.
