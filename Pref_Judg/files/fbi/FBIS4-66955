  [Text] Santa Fe de Bogota, 29 Apr (AFP) -- Gustavo de 
Greiff, Colombian prosecutor general, has stated in a letter 
sent to Foreign Minister Noemi Sanin the Colombian Government 
should protest to his U.S. counterpart for meddling in his 
justice decisions. 
  Thus, de Greiff has responded to a note by the U.S. 
Government protesting several of his actions, which are 
considered as too lenient regarding the drug-trafficking issue. 
  "I find as unacceptable, personally or officially, a 
government's attempts to influence in any way the sovereign 
decisions that should be made by Colombian judicial officials," 
the prosecutor general has stated in the letter to the Foreign 
Ministry. 
  The Colombian Government is studying the reply to the U.S. 
protest note, which, according to the Foreign Ministry, will 
take some time, given the legal complexity of the issue. 
  The Colombian prosecutor general has been the target of an 
avalanche of criticism this past month stemming from his 
statements that the best way to combat drug trafficking would be 
to legalize drugs. 
  Subsequently, he had contacted a U.S. judge who is 
processing 
Dandenys Munoz (a Medellin cartel member suspected of planting a 
bomb in 1989 in a commercial plane causing 107 victims) saying 
he has no evidence against Munoz. 
  U.S. authorities say de Greiff had requested on nine 
occasions to meet with another member of the cartel, Carlos 
Alzate, detained in a Santa Fe de Bogota jail, a request the 
prosecutor general has denied.
