  [Text] Santa Fe de Bogota, 6 Apr (DPA) -- Colombian Senate 
President Jorge Elias today asked the U.S. Government and 
judicial authorities not to meddle in his country's internal 
affairs. Elias was referring to criticisms made in Washington 
on the methods used to reduce the sentences of drug traffickers 
who surrender. 
  Elias, from the ruling Liberal Party, defended the system 
implemented by President Cesar Gaviria while noting that it was 
copied from the method that has been used in the United States 
for several years. 
  "The United States showed us the rules for surrendering to 
justice, the informers, the sentence reductions. We are 
following them here in Colombia," the congressman said in 
statements to the press. 
  The Senate president's position came in the wake of 
criticisms from the U.S. State Department on the "short" 
sentences for drug traffickers and on the contacts between 
Prosecutor General Gustavo de Greiff and Cali Cartel attorneys. 
  According to newspaper articles from Washington, the State 
Department believes the Colombian justice system is corrupt and 
is weak before the powerful drug traffickers. It is now in the 
hands of the U.S. Congress to decide whether to suspend judicial 
aid. 
  U.S. officials and spokesmen for the Colombian Prosecutor's 
Office said that in the past weeks the U.S. legal authorities 
stopped sending evidence to Santa Fe de Bogota against drug 
traffickers as a form of protest over statements by de Greiff, 
who said that repression is failing as a means of fighting drug 
trafficking. 
  De Greiff favors legalization of the drug trade as a 
strategy 
to dismantle the drug traffickers' multi-million dollar 
business. His ideas are questioned both in Colombia as well as 
the United States. 
  According to the Senate president, Colombia is a free, 
independent country that can decide if it wants to continue 
using sentence reduction for those who surrender. Since 1990, 
approximately 20 drug traffickers have availed themselves of 
this system. 
  Elias pointed out that U.S. judicial authorities "should be 
more concerned with their own problems--because they have a lot 
of them--before they make outrageous, unsubstantiated 
criticisms." 
  The decrees signed by Gaviria at the beginning of his 
administration provide for a significant sentence reduction for 
criminals who surrender, confess to at least one crime, and 
cooperate with justice. 
  De Greiff has been in contact with the attorneys of Gilberto 
Rodriguez, who is accused of being a Cali Cartel leader and is 
considering turning himself in.
