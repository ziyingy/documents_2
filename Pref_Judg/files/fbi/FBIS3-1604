  [Text] Beijing, February 26 (XINHUA) -- China is greatly 
shocked at and sternly condemns the killing of Palestinians in 
the West Bank, a Chinese Foreign Ministry spokesman said here 
today. 
  On February 25th, a Jewish settler in the West Bank fired at 
Palestinians, causing several hundred casualties. 
  "The Chinese Government is greatly shocked at and sternly 
condemns this serious terrorist act of violence, and expressed 
sympathy to the families of the innocent victims," the spokesman 
said. 
  "We call on the Israeli authorities to take all necessary 
measures to stop such acts of violence," the spokesman added. 
  This incident once again shows the urgency of seeking a just 
and reasonable solution to the Palestinians question, the 
spokesman said. There will not be tranquility in the Middle 
East in the absence of a solution to the Palestinian question. 
  "We sincerely hope that the parties concerned will remove 
obstacles and create proper conditions for accelerating the 
peace talks in the Middle East, so as to achieve a comprehensive 
peace in that region at an early date," the spokesman said.
