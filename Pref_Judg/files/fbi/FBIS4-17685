  [Text] Moscow, 25 Apr -- Russian President Boris Yeltsin has 
said that "it is our duty do everything to rid the world of 
radiation calamities for ever." 
  In an address to the citizens of Russia in connection with 
the day of memory for those who have perished in radiation 
disasters, the president notes that recently the state has taken 
a number of steps to strengthen the social protection of people 
who have suffered from radiation. 
  "I believe that it is the duty of the state to pay 
particular 
attention to these people and to give them social support and 
protection. The problems of radioactive pollution should become 
a priority in the affairs of the federal structures and 
executive power bodies of the components of the Federation," he 
stresses.
