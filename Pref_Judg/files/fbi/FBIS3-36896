  [Text] Officials of Lithuania and Belarus ended a meeting 
in Vilnius late on Tuesday by agreeing on a package of 
agreements on mutual travel regulations. 
  Vilnius announced last fall that citizens of all CIS states 
except Belarus would need entry visas to visit the country. 
Entry visas for Belarusians were to be imposed from January 1, 
but later rescheduled for March 1. 
  Foreign ministry officials and experts on both sides have 
now 
agreed on the wording of interim agreements on travel 
regulations, head of the Lithuanian foreign ministry's consular 
department Rimantas Sidlauskas told Interfax. Agreement was 
also reached on simplifying the procedure of border crossing for 
each other's citizens residing in border areas, 
  Sidlauskas described the deal as interim because the two 
sides are still to demarcate more than a 700 km-long border 
separating them. 
  From March 1, Belarusian travellers can apply for entry 
visas 
to Lithuania at the consular department of the Lithuanian 
embassy in Minsk and at border checkpoints in emergencies. 
  Citizens of Belarus and other CIS states may also use 
letters 
of invitation instead of visas until June 1. 
  One-time or multiple-use passes will be issued to the 
residents of border areas on both sides. 
  The package deal is to be signed soon, Sidlauskas said.
