  [Text] Prosecutor General Gustavo de Greiff was surprised 
and upset by U.S. Senator John Kerry's statements regarding 
policies of the Prosecutor General's Office on drug-trafficking 
problems. 
  [Begin de Greiff recording] Senator Kerry's opinions are not 
only false but also very offensive. I believe they not only 
offend me but the country as well. [end recording] 
  The prosecutor has also said the government should clarify 
to 
the senator his serious errors of assessment. 
  [Begin de Greiff recording] We have kept informed the 
government institutions that cooperate with us on this issue. 
The prosecutor general has been present at all those meetings; 
thus, there has been no secret meeting. [end recording] 
  The prosecutor explained once again his position regarding 
the legalization of drugs and the negotiations with the alleged 
Cali Cartel drug lords. 
  [Begin de Greiff recording] This started a long time before 
the alleged meetings, which, according to Senator Kerry, were 
held clandestinely; thus, this gentleman is totally mistaken, 
and I believe Colombia should protest his statements. [end 
recording] 
  Prosecutor de Greiff sent a long document to Senator Kerry 
yesterday pointing out the conceptual and formal mistakes which, 
in his opinion, the senator made.
