  [Text] Seoul, Feb. 3 (YONHAP) -- Student exchanges with 
China are certain to become more active as soon as the South 
Korean Government liberalizes travel to China in late March, a 
Foreign Ministry official said on Thursday. The official 
predicted that overseas study in China will be activated and 
liberalized when China is excluded from "specific" countries in 
the government's "guideline on exchanges with northern (former 
and present communist) countries" in late March. 
  "China is now among the specific countries targeted by the 
guideline, so students who want to study in China are not able 
to gain favors like suspended military service," the official 
noted.
