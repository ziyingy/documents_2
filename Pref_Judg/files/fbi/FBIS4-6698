  [Text] Tokyo, April 19 KYODO -- Tokyo police and 
immigration authorities arrested five Chinese Tuesday [19 April] 
for allegedly assisting some 150 compatriots looking for work in 
Japan to sneak into the country in February and March. 
  Police also arrested six more Chinese for allegedly trying 
to 
sneak in Japan. All were arrested for suspected violations of 
the Immigration Control and Refugee Recognition Law. 
  Tokyo immigrations authorities are holding a total of 14 
Chinese suspected of being involved in the large-scale illegal 
entry attempt earlier this year. 
  Meanwhile in Tokushima Prefecture on Shikoku, the smallest 
of 
Japan's four main islands, police arrested three Thai workers 
for overstaying their original 90-day visas issued in June 1991. 
According to investigators, the three continued to work at a 
woodworking firm in Tokushima even though their visas had 
expired. 
  In the Chinese case, the five suspected contacts for the 
Chinese attempting to enter Japan allegedly met about 60 Chinese 
coming ashore near a Wakayama fishing village and then took them 
by rented car to Nagoya where they boarded a Shinkansen bullet 
train to Tokyo. The five are suspected of sheltering the 
illegal entrants in an apartment in Tokyo's Toshima ward. 
  According to one of the Chinese sneaking into Japan, they 
were told that they could make money in Japan, but needed 2.7 
million yen to pay for the sea transportation. The would-be 
worker testified that a portion of the fee had already been paid. 
  Police said they are pursuing the strong likelihood that the 
smuggling of Chinese workers into Japan is an organized effort.
