  [Text] Tokyo, May 12 KYODO -- Japan will "do its utmost" 
to bloc a proposal for a whale sanctuary in the Antarctic Ocean, 
the head of Japan's delegation to the May 23-27 International 
Whaling Commission (IWC) annual conference in Mexico said 
Thursday [12 May]. 
  Kazuo Shima, who is deputy director of the Fisheries Agency, 
told a group of 400 whaling industry supporters dining on whale 
meat at the Parliamentary Museum in Tokyo that the antiwhaling 
movement has no "scientific basis." 
  He said Japan will rely on established scientific facts to 
push its case at the 46th IWC General Assembly meeting in Puerto 
Vallarta on the central Mexican Pacific coast. 
  "The arguments put by the antiwhaling movement lack any 
scientific basis," Shima said. "You might as well say they are 
a religion." 
  "If the proposal for a sanctuary is adopted, this sort of 
thing will spread to all oceans around the world," he said. "If 
this is introduced, we will have to think from basics about our 
relationship with the IWC. We will do our utmost to block it." 
  Participants at the meeting, convened by the "society to 
protect whaling tradition and cuisine," included members of 
opposition and governing coalition parties, officials from the 
Japan Whaling Association and the Institute of Cetacean 
Research, as well as writers and entertainers. 
  The society's members want the IWC to permit a resumption of 
commercial whaling by Japan. 
  Japan stopped commercial whaling in 1988 following an IWC 
ban.
