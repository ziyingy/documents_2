With Ethnic Cleansing of Kosova"] 
  [Text] The Serbian gang leader, Zeljko Raznjatovic Arkan, 
accused of war crimes and atrocities and wanted in 42 countries, 
in a press conference held Friday [29 April] in Prishtina, 
capital of the republic of Kosova, said that his "party" will be 
more present in Kosovo, and that it would be engaged in 
colonizing Kosova with Serbs. "Those refugees that lost 
everything they had in Croatia and Bosnia should be settled in 
Kosova," he said, adding that "this should be carried out with a 
simultaneous expulsion of some 700,000 Albanians to Albania." 
He emphasized that "Mr. Rugova should no longer be allowed to 
live in Serbia, therefore he must be deported to his alternate 
mother country, Albania." 
  A new citizenship law underway in the Serbian Parliament, he 
said, will enable this ethnic cleansing. 
  Speaking on the deployment of Serbian army forces near the 
Albanian border and the presence of American troops in Macedonia 
[The Former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia -- FYROM], 
criminal-accused Arkan said "Serbs are never scared. [Word 
indistinct] will be cut off."
