<F P=106> [Report by NTV correspondent Nestor Labrada on the Ciego de </F>
Avila AIDS Sanatorium, including interviews with the sanatorium 
director and patients; date not given -- recorded] 
  [Text] [Labrada] Every 24 hours approximately 
5,000 people in the world become seropositive of the Human 
Immunodificiency Virus [HIV], which causes the Acquired 
Immunodificiency Syndrome [AIDS]. This is the AIDS Sanatorium of 
Ciego de Avila, one of the 13 currently operating in Cuba. In 
these centers, more than 900 patients receive dedicated care. 
For each patient, the state spends more than 28,000 pesos 
annually. The centers form part of the extensive program 
operating in Cuba to prevent the spread of the epidemic, a 
program that ranges from testing pregnant women to monitoring 
seropositive cases. Orestes Antonio Varo, director of the Ciego 
de Avila Sanatorium, points out that patients receive not only 
medical treatment but also the understanding and affection that 
is needed in these cases. 
[Varo] Efforts are made to keep the patients healthy 
and to establish a favorable psychological environment that will 
ultimately benefit their health. Furthermore, we prepare the 
patients for a future mobile service, which we hope to implement 
soon. The Ministry of Public Health is currently working very 
hard on this program so that our patients can return to the 
streets and live a normal life. 
[Labrada] For four consecutive days, these patients 
at the [words indistinct] receive the necessary treatment. They 
spend the rest of the week with their relatives at home. 
[First unidentified patient] Life in the sanatorium 
is very good. The truth is that if it were not for the 
sanatorium and the government, we would not be receiving any 
treatment. 
[Labrada] Many would like to incorporate themselves 
into society. 
[Second unidentified patient] I would like to 
continue my normal life. 
[Labrada] To this day, many associate the sickness 
with moral problems and do not understand that AIDS is a disease 
that affects all people and one that it is everybody's 
responsibility to prevent. 
[Third unidentified patient] I call on the youth and 
the population to maintain stability with regard to their 
partner; to practice safe sex; and not to reject people with 
AIDS just for being seropositive, but to help us overcome this 
evil so that we can all overcome it.
