<F P=106> [Article by S. Karnevi and E. Dean: "Envisat's Advanced </F>
Synthetic Aperture Radar: ASAR"] 
  [Text] An advanced Synthetic Aperture Radar (ASAR) has 
been selected as the imaging radar sensor for the Envisat-1 
payload. In addition to providing continuity of data with the 
single-swath, single-polarisation Active Microwave 
Instrumentation (AMI) currently flying on ERS-1 (and ERS-2), the 
ASAR has the additional advantages of offering: greater 
coverage, with more flexibility in the choice of swath 
positions, a wider range of incidence angles, and a wide swath 
capability; dual polarisation; and improved wave mode 
capabilities. 
<H5>  ASAR'S Role </H5>
  The objectives for the Advanced SAR are very similar to 
those 
of the AMI on ERS-1 and ERS-2. The main task will again be that 
of monitoring the Earth's environment to collect more precise 
information on global change, focussing specifically on global 
climate and all of the factors that may influence it. 
  Monitoring of the Earth's bio-mass, especially the 
deforestation in the large primeval forests in the equatorial 
regions, will allow better modelling of the influence on the 
greenhouse effect and global climate and facilitate the 
implementation of countermeasures. 
  Desertification and the distribution of humidity, changes in 
water levels, flooded areas, and the extent of the ice caps 
around the North and South Poles are other major factors that 
need to be monitored in order to improve our understanding of 
global climate change. 
  Envisat's SAR images will also further improve our 
understanding of ocean dynamics, the interactions between oceans 
and atmosphere, as well as both manmade and natural processes in 
coastal zones. 
  The major advantage of using a SAR for earth-observation 
tasks lies in its ability to acquire imagery day or night and 
independent of cloud cover and weather conditions. This 
weather-independent capability is of vital importance for 
disaster assessment, as major floods or large oil spills, 
usually occur in weather conditions that drastically curtail the 
usefulness of optical sensors. 
  ERS-1 SAR images have also proved extremely useful for 
shipping operations in Arctic ice. Ocean-wave spectra taken 
around the globe with ASAR will further improve the safety of 
shipping routes and offshore activities. 
  As experience with SAR data grows, its contribution to 
resource management will also become more and more important. 
In addition to the bio-mass estimating application already 
mentioned, improved classification methods will allow more 
accurate harvest predictions, better estimates of sweet-water 
resources and, via geological surveys, support the search for 
mineral resources. 
<H5>  The ASAR Instrument </H5>
  Given the rapid expansion in the SAR data user community, it 
is essential that Envisat should carry an instrument that not 
only provides data continuity with ERS-1 and ERS-2, but also at 
the same time represents a step forward in terms of both system 
flexibility and the scientific and operational value of its data 
sets. 
  To satisfy these needs, the ASAR design incorporates: 
  -- A flexible swath-position capability, which will offer 
the 
choice between several image swath positions at various 
distances from the subsatellite track with different incidence 
angles. 
  -- A dual-polarisation facility (cf. vertical only on ERS), 
offering horizontal or vertical polarisation imaging. 
  The ASAR's ability to switch between different swaths offers 
very fast multiplexing, so that an overall swath more than 400 
km wide can be imaged in one pass. In addition to this 
so-called "Wide Swath Mode", the ASAR can be set to operate at a 
coarse spatial resolution of only 1000 m. The data rate will 
then be low enough for tape recording onboard the spacecraft. 
This is known as the "Global Monitoring Mode" and it 
constitutes a tool for monitoring such features as ice coverage, 
snow coverage, deforestation, desertification or humidity, 
without interruption and on a global scale, due to its 
independence from ground-station coverage. 
  The ASAR's ability to switch between two polarisation allows 
a special "Alternating Polarisation Mode" to be implemented 
which permits half of the looks at a scene to be acquired with a 
horizontal, and the other half with a vertical polarisation in a 
single pass, thereby considerably increasing the target 
classification capability (especially if used in conjunction 
with multi-temporal imaging of the same scene). 
  Furthermore ASAR will, like ERS, have a "Wave Mode" for 
taking 5 x 5 km images but more frequently, over 100 or 200 km 
distances, and with two such images in any swath over the 
oceans, to supply ocean-wave spectra on a global basis. 
  The ASAR instrument is divided functionally into two 
sub-assemblies: 
  -- An Antenna Sub-Assembly (ASA), containing the 
phased-array 
antenna electronics distributed over 20 "tiles", and 
  -- A Central Electronics Sub-Assembly (CESA), providing 
signal (RF) generation and reception, control signals, power 
conditioning and data formatting. 
  The ASAR antenna consists of five hinged panels, each 
containing four tiles. 
  The CESA equipment units are mounted on three of the Payload 
Equipment Bay panels inside the spacecraft. 
  Control of the instrument covers the following functions: 
  -- Selecting the required mode and generating the 
appropriate 
timeline. 
  -- Selecting the required antenna beam pattern for the 
required swath (or beam patterns in modes where multiple swaths 
are needed). 
  -- Housekeeping, including setting redundancy paths. 
  -- Monitoring the status of all equipment. 
  -- Patching and dumping any software. 
  Control is maintained by sending macro-commands via the 
onboard computer to the Instrument Control Unit (ICU). 
<H5>  Instrument Performance </H5>
  The ASAR instrument has several operating modes, which can 
be 
grouped into four areas: 
  -- Support modes 
  -- Operational modes 
  -- Calibration modes 
  -- Test/health-check modes. 
  The various roles are summarised in Table 1.

  The operational modes can themselves be divided into three 
different categories: 
  -- High-spatial-resolution imaging modes 
  -- Low-spatial-resolution imaging modes 
  -- Wave mode. 
<H5>  High-spatial-resolution Imaging Modes </H5>
  In these two modes - the so-called "Image Mode" and 
"Alternating Polarisation Mode" - the ASAR operates as an 
imaging radar with high spatial resolution (typically a few tens 
of metres), and relatively narrow swaths (up to 120 km). 
  The Image Mode provides continuous coverage over a single 
swath nominally 100 km wide. The swath can be selected anywhere 
within a 500 km region (incidence angle range 15-45 degrees). 
For nominal operation, seven swaths (IS1 to IS7) are defined 
over this region. The imaging is performed by transmitting a 
continuous series of pulses and acquiring the required echo 
information after the appropriate return trip delay. 
  The transition to Image Mode is made automatically following 
the appropriate macro-command. Before the actual measurement of 
data is initiated, a period of stabilisation, noise measurement 
and internal calibration is performed. Echo measurement then 
starts, during which the initial calibration is updated on a 
regular basis. Image Mode operation continues uninterrupted 
until the receipt of another macro-command to switch to another 
mode. 
  The Alternating Polarisation Mode provides vertically and 
horizontally polarised imaging of the same scene by interleaving 
looks with each polarisation along track within the synthetic 
aperture. The echo measurement is made within repetition cycles 
containing two bursts of transmissions on each of the 
polarisations. The sequence is only interrupted when the 
internal calibration requires updating (as for the Image Mode). 
<H5>  Low-Spatial-Resolution Imaging Modes </H5>
  These are the "Wide Swath Mode" and "Global Monitoring 
Mode", 
in which the ASAR operates as an imaging radar with low spatial 
resolution (100 m to 1 km) and relatively wide swath (more than 
400 km). To obtain global coverage for the Global Monitoring 
Mode, the data is stored onboard the satellite and transferred 
to ground when it passes over a ground station. 
  The Wide Swath Mode provides continuous coverage over a 
swath 
nominally 400 km wide, which is divided into five subswaths 
ranging from 60 to 100 km in width. The ASAR transmits bursts 
of pulses to each of the subswaths in turn in such a way that a 
continuous along-track image is built up for each subswath. 
  During a transition to Wide Swath Mode, all the necessary 
data transfers and timing parameters are established. 
Stabilisation, noise measurement and internal calibration 
follow in a similar manner to the Image Mode, after which the 
echo measurement sequence itself commences. For each subswath, 
there is a burst of transmissions followed by a short quiescent 
period whilst the echoes from the last transmit pulses are 
received. Transmissions then switch to the next subswath in the 
cycle. The updating of the internal calibration is performed at 
the end of each subswath transmission burst. 
  The Global Monitoring Mode provides continuous along-track 
sampling across a 400 km swath, again using a SAR scanning 
technique. This mode has a low data rate due to a slightly 
reduced along-track duty ratio and the use of digital filtering 
for reduction in the across-track direction. The same subswaths 
as defined for the Wide Swath Mode are used. 
<H5>  Wave Mode </H5>
  In the "Wave Mode", the ASAR uses the facilities of the 
Image 
Mode to image small areas of the ocean surface, measuring the 
changes in radar backscatter from the surface due to wave 
action. The imaging is carried out to a high spatial resolution 
over one or two areas across a swath of approximately 5 km x 5 
km at intervals of nominally 100 or 200 km in the along-track 
direction. 
  The transition to Wave Mode is identical to that for the 
Image Mode, including the initial calibration sequence. This is 
followed by a burst of transmissions covering the 5 km 
along-track vignette distance. A quiescent period is then used 
to transfer the data to the Payload Data Handling and 
Transmission System via the low-rate data interface. The total 
duration of the repetition cycle is the time taken to traverse 
the 100 or 200 km separation between vignettes. Noise and 
calibration sequences are repeated at the start of each cycle. 
  The predicted in-orbit performances of the ASAR instrument 
in 
its various modes of operation are presented in Table 2. The 
instrument is still in the development stage and its final 
performance parameters will be established as part of the 
Preliminary Design Review, scheduled for early 1994.

<H5>  Product Processing </H5>
  The images acquired by ASAR will be processed on the ground 
and distributed mainly from ESRIN in Frascati(I). The products 
will fall into four main categories: 
  -- High-Resolution Images, generated within 24 h of sensing 
and normally distributed by non-electronic means, similar to the 
ERS-1 Precision Image (PRI). 
  -- Fast-Delivery Products, delivered within 3 h of sensing 
via electronic links; this product will have a lower geometric 
resolution (approx. 100 m pixels). 
  -- Browse Products, delivered within 3 h, but with very low 
resolution, and used for Browse Catalogues. 
  -- Wave Imagettes and Spectra, similar to the ERS-1 wave 
spectra, but with the ASAR enhancements. 
<H5>  Conclusion </H5>
  In addition to achieving comparable performance to ERS-1 in 
the swath that coincides with the ERS-1 single fixed swath, the 
ASAR instrument will give Envisat-1: 
  -- Wider swath and incidence-angle coverage 
  -- A second channel of information by means of the dual- 
polarisation capability 
  -- Variable spatial resolutions and data rates. 
  In addition, the ASAR can be tuned during its in-orbit 
lifetime to make optimum use of the power available. Satellite 
instrument designs are generally driven by end-of-life 
requirements, which often results in under-utilisation early in 
a mission. The ASAR's built-in flexibility will allow it to 
take advantage of beginning-of-life conditions. It will also 
enable operating modes other than the baseline modes that were 
identified in Table 1 to be explored during the Envisat-1 
mission, thereby helping to define requirements and modes of 
operation for future SAR missions.
