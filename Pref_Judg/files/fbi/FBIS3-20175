<F P=106> [Unattributed article: "Cabinet Wants Registration Centers </F>
for Asylum-Seekers at Borders"] 
  [Excerpts] The Hague -- The cabinet is going to set up two 
big registration centers for asylum-seekers at the borders with 
Germany and Belgium. In the Lower Chamber last Thursday [24 
March], State Secretary of Justice Kosto stated that these 
"intake centers" will serve as "locks" for the actual reception 
centers for asylum-seekers. 
  Kosto says that foreigners who, in the Justice Department's 
opinion, do not stand a fair chance of getting asylum in the 
Netherlands, will be rapidly "sorted out" from the remaining 
asylum-seekers in the intake centers. Unlike the remaining 
centers, which come under the Ministry of Welfare, Health and 
Cultural Affairs (WVC), both registration centers will be 
controlled by the Justice Department. 
  The CDA [Christian Democratic Appeal] and VVD [People's 
Party 
for Freedom and Democracy] factions, which still hold a 
parliamentary majority, support the proposal. The plan will be 
materialized as soon as Parliament has passed both bills 
regarding the treatment of asylum-seekers from "safe countries." 
According to Lubbers, these bills are unlikely to be ratified 
before 1995. 
  An asylum-seeker who is told in an intake center that he is 
not eligible for the procedure because he had to request asylum 
in Germany or Belgium, keeps the right to object to this 
decision with the Netherlands judge. This is in conformity with 
international obligations. Unlike now, however, the government 
will no longer see to his attendance. [passage omitted] 
  "We are faced with the fact, that our reception capacity is 
scarce, while asylum-seekers are increasingly numerous." The 
state secretary hopes that faster summary proceedings will soon 
be possible in the neighbourhood of the registration centers.

  During "the big asylum debate" yesterday, the government 
parties CDA and PvdA [Labor Party] were diametrically opposed to 
each other. All by himself, De Hoop Scheffer from CDA called 
for a restoration of border controls, in order to immediately 
stop foreigners who are not entitled to asylum. 
  Border controls were lifted one year ago, within the 
framework of the much-praised free movement of persons between 
the "Schengen countries." This situation cannot be reverted 
unilaterally by the Netherlands, State Secretary of European 
Affairs Dankert argued. "In addition, it would raise a huge 
political problem." [passage omitted] 
  Parliament was very critical of the asylum policy's 
implementation. As the coordinating cabinet member, Prime 
Minister Lubbers admitted that, to his own annoyance, 
discussions between the relevant departments caused very serious 
delays. "It has to do with carefulness. But there is a time 
when the prime minister says: `That's enough.' Things must be 
smoothed out. The situation has gotten out of hand."
