El-Ghozlane"] 
  [Text] Forty-five (45) confirmed cases of typhoid have been 
reported in recent days at Sour El-Ghozlane (wilaya of Bouira), 
where the first case was identified on 20 December. 
  The number of persons under observation at the Sour 
El-Ghozlane hospital reportedly has reached 68, a majority of 
whom are adolescents. "Those infected were immediately put in 
isolation," say top local health officials, adding that "the 
prognosis for these patients is good." The health director and 
the head of the daira of Sour El-Ghozlane noted in that regard 
that "the appearance of this waterborne epidemic may be due to 
problems in the city's water treatment system." 
  Other sources point to the decrepit condition of pipes 
carrying waste water, which might have seeped into potable water 
conduits.
