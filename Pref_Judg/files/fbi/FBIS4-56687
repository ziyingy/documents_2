  [Text] Attorney General Carlos Gustavo Arrieta's strong 
opposition to the Constitutional Court's recent decision has 
apparently weakened the legal arguments supporting the approval 
of the personal drug dose. 
  [Begin Arrieta recording] I disagree with the ruling, which 
I 
think is capable of creating complex legal, moral, social, and 
international problems in the country. In terms of the law, 
such a broad interpretation of personal freedom could create 
distortions that have no place in this government. We will soon 
find ourselves debating other social issues, such as euthanasia 
or suicide. Let us keep in mind that personal freedom cannot be 
extended to a point at which it harms society. [end recording]
