  [Text] Shanghai, January 6 (XINHUA) -- Shanghai, China's 
largest port, handled imports and exports totalling 12.72 
billion U.S. dollars in 1993, up 30 percent from the year before. 
  An official of the municipal Commission of Foreign Trade and 
Economic Cooperation said that exports from Shanghai, the 
country's leading manufacturing center, climbed nearly 13 
percent in 1993 to 7.38 billion U.S. dollars. 
  The municipal government decided to take all possible 
measures to boost exports, considered a driving force behind the 
city's economic growth, the official said. 
  Large-scale construction and development have kept 
Shanghai's 
import demand rising, he said. 
  As a result, imports soared by almost 67 percent last year 
to 
5.34 billion dollars. 
  The official said that imported technology, equipment and 
raw 
materials helped Shanghai step up its infrastructure 
construction, retool its aging enterprises and promote 
production of foreign- funded businesses. 
  He expected Shanghai's imports and exports to grow further 
in 
the new year. Exports are projected to shoot up by 15 percent 
to 8.47 billion dollars in 1994, while imports are expected to 
rise by around 15 percent.
