  [Text] Moscow, 29 Mar (PL) -- Sources in the economic 
section of the Cuban Embassy in Russia have stated, based on the 
bilateral agreements signed last December, the exchange of 
Russian oil for Cuban sugar should start soon. 
  Cuban officials who have spoken to PRENSA LATINA mentioned 
the information published by the INTERFAX NEWS AGENCY today on 
Russia shipping 2.5 million tons of oil to the Antillean island. 
  This exchange was agreed upon at the talks held between both 
countries in December 1993. The exchange only required 
ratification by this country's government [not further 
identified], a step which was taken 25 March. 
  INTERFAX added Havana will send 1 million tons of sugar, and 
the Russian Foreign Economic Relations Ministry is to determine 
which firms will export the crude oil. 
  This operation was ratified in Resolution 228 of the 
government headed by Prime Minister Viktor Chernomyrdin, the 
Cuban officials in Moscow added.
