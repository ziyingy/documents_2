  [Text] Caracas, 4 May (EFE) -- Commenting on a court 
decision acquitting 32 presumed drug traffickers, Judge Mildred 
Camero denounced on 4 May that drug trafficking has infiltrated 
all levels of the Venezuelan judicial branch. 
  Camero, judge of the Second Trial Court, said the judicial 
branch has lost credibility in Venezuela. 
  "Drug trafficking is everywhere and is increasingly 
corrupting those institutions that were once untouchable. We 
must adopt a firm position on the drug problem," she said. 
  Camero said there is money laundering and the legalization 
of 
drug-related capital in Venezuela. She added there seems to be 
a heavy flow of money into the country, but a high rate of 
poverty prevails, because a false economy is what really exists. 
  Camero had issued arrest warrants against 32 presumed drug 
traffickers, including Rafael Alcantara, president of the 
exchange house "Cavelba," who spent four and one-half months in 
prison for alleged money laundering. Alcantara was acquitted 
yesterday by Judge Luis Contreras Ramirez of the Second Trial 
Court. 
  Alcantara said he will sue Camero for abuse of authority and 
the huge losses he incurred when he had to close his business.
