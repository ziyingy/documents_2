  [Text] The National Space Development Agency (NASDA, 
Director, Masato Yamano) has completed the design of two 
experimental vehicles, the ``hypersonic flight experiment'' 
(HYFLEX) and the ``automatic landing flight experiment'' 
(ALFLEX). Both represent progress toward future development of 
an operational space shuttle system, the ``unmanned space 
shuttle'' (HOPE), on which NASDA has been conducting R&amp;D. The 
production stage will begin in April. Two primary contractors, 
Mitsubishi Heavy Industries, Ltd. (in charge of HYFLEX) and 
Kawasaki Heavy Industries, Ltd. (in charge of ALFLEX), disclosed 
that construction of both vehicles is scheduled to be completed 
by spring 1996 and delivered to NASDA. 
  Both experimental vehicles are intended for future 
development of the operational HOPE which is scheduled for 
launch in the early 21st century. The HOPE is an unmanned space 
shuttle, which under the space transportation system will serve 
as a carrier of materials from the earth to an international 
space station in earth orbit. After delivering its load, the 
shuttle will leave orbit, re-enter the atmosphere, and return to 
earth. At present, research on conceptual design and basic 
technology for the HOPE is under way. Both HYFLEX and ALFLEX are 
vehicles to examine those technologies. HYFLEX explores whether 
or not stable flight can be maintained at hypersonic speed when 
transporting as well as subsonic speed when returning to earth. 
MHI, with the collaboration of their subcontractors, has been 
conducting development and design in the areas of materials 
which can endure high temperatures during atmospheric re-entry 
and the shape of airframes which can maintain stable flight at a 
wide range of sonic velocities. 
  ALFLEX, on the other hand, is aimed at developing a system 
that will make unmanned flights from atmospheric re-entry to 
landing at a designated place. KHI has focused most of its 
development and design effort on automatic flight systems such 
as those that employ microwave guidance devices to precisely 
control flight through integrated processing and control of 
signals sent by navigation sensors using on-board computers. The 
development cost is approximately &yen;5 billion for each 
experimental vehicle, for a total of &yen;10 billion. 
  Both companies have completed verification and design on 
paper for both experimental vehicles, and therefore have moved 
on to production. HYFLEX is scheduled to be produced at MHI's 
Nagoya Aerospace System Works and ALFLEX, at KHI's Gifu Plant. 
NASDA plans to put the HYFLEX, after delivery is made by MHI, 
aboard the J-1 rocket scheduled for launch during the summer of 
1996 and fly the ALFLEX in the fall of 1996 to evaluate their 
performance.
