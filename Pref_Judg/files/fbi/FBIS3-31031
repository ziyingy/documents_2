Technical Equipment From the Persian Gulf"] 
  [Text] Prague--Despite the fact that as long ago as last 
November the U.S. Department of Defense indicated its interest 
in the chemical instruments used by Czech soldiers to gauge the 
presence of sarin and yperit in the Gulf war, the Pentagon has 
not yet taken delivery of this equipment. 
  The staff of the Press Department at the Czech Ministry of 
Defense reported that the U.S. side is finishing the text of an 
agreement on the basis of which the transfer of the equipment is 
to be executed. The Czech side is ready for the transaction. 
  The Pentagon, which acknowledged the results of the readings 
by the Czechoslovak chemical warfare unit from the war against 
Iraq two years ago, wanted to test the measuring instruments in 
chemical laboratories in the United States to assess the 
reliability of the data. 
  The Pentagon was particularly interested in the prototype 
for 
a simple, yet effective instrument for rapid detection of the 
most dangerous toxic substances of the orgonophosphate type 
known as Detehit. It also wanted to examine the PCHL-90 
portable chemical laboratory and the DP-86 modern digital 
dosimetric instruments used for detecting radioactive 
contamination. If the instruments tested well, the Americans 
would allegedly buy them.
