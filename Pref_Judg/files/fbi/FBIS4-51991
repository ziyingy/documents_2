People's Army.

People's Army, highly estimated as a heroic deed the merits 
performed by Pak Hyong-uk to strengthen and develop the People's 
Army into the revolutionary Armed Forces of chuche and defend 
the security of the country and the gains of the revolution, for 
nearly 50 years after the liberation of the country, and sent a 
benevolent 60th birthday table to him.

boyhood before the liberation, had grown to be a fine commanding
