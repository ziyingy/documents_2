  [Text] Bucharest, ROMPRES, 26/4/1994 -- By the end of 
March, 2,736 AIDS cases were registered of which 2,547 cases 
involved children. 
  Statistics available say the adults have got infected with 
the AIDS virus mainly through unprotected heterosexual contacts 
(49.7 percent), while homosexual contacts caused only 7 percent 
of the cases. 
  While drugs-use cases have not been singled out, for about 
30 
percent of the cases the infecting pattern has not been 
explained. 
  The majority of the afflicted children have got infected in 
hospitals and orphanages (32 percent) especially through blood 
transfusions (24.7 percent). 
  The largest number of AIDS cases (373) are registered in 
Bucharest, followed by the counties of Constanta (with a rate 
close to the Bucharest one), then Giurgiu, Galati, Bacau. 
Several counties such as Cluj, Alba, Salaj, Maramures have each 
registered only one case. 
  In spite of the last four years' education of the public and 
severe measures to bar the AIDS spreading, Romania still holds 
the first place in Europe with the number of AIDS cases at 
children, because of the negligence before 1989. [sentenced as
