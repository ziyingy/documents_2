  [Text] Israel's chief rabbis differ over the question of 
evacuating the Jewish settlers from Hebron. Ashkenazi Rabbi 
Yisra'el Lau opposes their evacuation, while Sephardic Rabbi 
Baqshi Doron believes that the duty to save lives overrides the 
biblical duty to maintain a Jewish settlement in Hebron. 
  Our correspondent Mikha'el Tuchfeld reports that interviews 
with the two rabbis will appear in tomorrow's edition of the 
ultra-Orthodox paper YOM HASHISHI. 
  Rabbi Lau goes on to say in the interview that even if 
politicians and the military rule that the Palestinians should 
be given self-rule, this should be done in a way so as not to 
undermine our right over Eretz Yisra'el. 
  Both rabbis lash out at the Religious Affairs Ministry 
which, 
as they see it, impinges on the authority of the Chief Rabbinate.
