<F P=106> [Report on interview with Prime Minister John Major by </F>
George Jones in London on 7 Jun: "Majority `Back Tory Instincts 
Over Europe'"] 
  [Text] Only 48 hours before the European elections, Mr 
Major was in a bullish mood during an interview yesterday at No 
10. A Gallup poll suggesting that more than half the electors 
are ready to vote Labour tomorrow has stiffened his resolve to 
stand and fight. Interviewed in the No 10 Cabinet room, Mr Major 
made clear he is ready to be more aggressive in convincing the 
public over the Government's "unpopular but right" decisions to 
curb inflation and spoke on policies covering a range of issues. 
<H5>  The EC: `Surveys Reinforce All Our Instincts' </H5>
  Asked to clarify his vision of a "multi-speed Europe", Mr 
Major produced a copy of yesterday's DAILY TELEGRAPH from his 
Ministerial box by his side on the Cabinet table. He pointed to 
a report of the latest Gallup poll headlined: "Britons Remain 
Ambivalent About Europe." 
  Clearly pleased by the results, he said: ``Almost all 
Anthony 
King (author of the report) has written in this morning's paper 
could have been extracts from my speeches. He states: `They 
want the benefits that a Strong European Union can bring but are 
worried that Britain may lose control of its affairs'. 
  ``That has a familiar ring. It is very interesting that the 
instincts we have on Europe are strongly reinforced in attitude 
surveys. 
  ``Most people are not Eurosceptic or Euro-enthusiasts. The 
argument is conducted at these two extremes, but down the middle 
of these extremes is a broad highway of public and political 
opinion that says: we must be part of Europe because it is in 
our economic interests to do so; we must co-operate where it is 
appropriate with our European partners; that co-operation often 
must be by agreement, by consensus and not by direction from 
Brussels. We must look at things in a pragmatic and practical 
way in making decisions on Europe. We should not commit 
ourselves now to things that may or may not happen in a long 
time in the future in circumstances we don't know with partners 
we can't be certain of. That is a very straightforward view of 
Europe that would carry 95 per cent of the population with it.'' 
  Mr Major searched in his box again for the latest Foreign 
Office telegrams; on the Euro-election campaign in Germany for 
proof that he was not alone in Europe in trying to curb the 
centralising tendencies of Brussels. 
  "It is very instructive to look at the election campaign in 
Germany," he said. ``Only the FDP [Free Democratic Party], the 
Liberals, are really Euro-enthusiastic. If you take the CDU 
[Christian Democratic Union], Chancellor Kohl's party, their 
poster is a large German flag superimposed on a less visible 
European flag and the Slogan `For Germany's sake.' 
  ``If I had produced that in this country I would be accused 
of running a nationalist campaign. Nobody accused the Germans 
of running a nationalist campaign. They are not. 
  ``The truth is Germany -- like Britain, France and Spain -- 
has to put its national interest at the heart of their concerns 
in Europe and they do. And that is what we do.'' 
<H5>  The Economy: `We Have Rightly Taken Unpopular Decision' </H5>
  Mr Major was upbeat about improvement in the economy: "You 
are seeing it in production, productivity growth, borrowing 
figures," he said. ``All of those indicate we are on target for 
our growth estimate of 2.5 per cent in the current year. 
  ``That will be getting on for probably twice as high as 
anyone else in the rest of Europe, unless they revise their 
present growth estimates upwards. 
  ``We are not a short-term Government; we are a long-term 
Government. We are unpopular because we have taken unpopular 
decisions that will prove to be right in the long term. 
  ``I sense people are getting bored with personality 
politics, 
trivial politics, and they want a rational, sensible debate on 
the matters that will affect their future. We are taking long 
term decisions. 
  ``Getting inflation down -- that has meant high interest 
rates, but we have got it down to levels that most people cannot 
remember seeing before. We have set an inflation bracket of 
between 1 and 4 per cent that we intend to maintain.'' 
<H5>  Unemployment: `The Sixth Largest Nation in Europe' </H5>
  "We have 20 million people unemployed in Europe. Only one 
country in Europe -- the UK -- has unemployment going down," 
said the Prime Minister. 
  ``The rest have unemployment going up. Unless we are able to 
become more competitive, that trend will continue --22, 24, 25 
million. 
  ``At what point does that stretch the democratic elastic too 
far? At what point do people rebel across Europe? 
  ``The unemployed are the sixth largest nation in the 
European 
Union. We need unemployment going down not up. Those 
politicians who just play to the gallery by asking for extra 
costs on employers will just put unemployment up. 
  ``I believe the responsible thing to do is to try to take 
action to get those people back to work. That is what we are 
doing here. and what the rest of Europe is not doing.'' 
<H5>  Northern Ireland: `More Has Been Done Than People Realise' </H5>
  Mr Major said last week's Chinook helicopter disaster which 
killed 25 of the most senior anti-terrorist figures in Northern 
Ireland, was "a great personal tragedy and a considerable loss 
to the public service." 
  He said others would come forward to do their work against 
terrorism -- "That is in hand already." 
  But he dismissed reports that the tragedy would hasten the 
appointment of a new national security co-ordinator to oversee 
all terrorist investigations on mainland Britain. 
  Mr Major said it was an idea that had been around for a long 
time. "We examined it. There are some very compelling and 
practical arguments against it." 
  "It is not the case that we are planning to introduce a 
brand 
new supremo in this field. It is not going to happen. We have 
decided the balance of argument is against it." 
  He voiced his confidence that Mr Gerry Adams, the Sinn Fein 
leader, would not be given another visa to visit the United 
States. "I don't believe you will see him back." 
  He believed that people had underestimated the importance of 
the Downing Street declaration on the future of Northern 
Ireland, which had resulted in the IRA becoming increasingly 
isolated. 
  "Areas where they could have expected support in the past 
have drained away from them. We must continue to isolated them, 
put them on the back foot, keep them as an unpalatable aspect of 
life in Northern Ireland and diminish their influence and 
support." 
  He said talks with the constitutional parties had moved 
forward a long way. "Further than most people may imagine. But 
there is still quite a lot to be done. It is a slow, grinding 
business. It involves a huge amount of detail and 
consideration. But more has been done than most people realise." 
<H5>  Drugs: `For Us the Issue Is a Higher Priority' </H5>
  With police chiefs meeting today to discuss their strategy 
against a background of growing demands for cannabis possession 
to be decriminalised, Mr Major said he had decided against that 
though he understood the arguments of its proponents, whom he 
respected. 
  ``But my instincts go in the other direction. I don't 
instinctively favour decriminalisation of soft drugs. I believe 
the best way to tackle drug abuse and trafficking is not to 
legalise drugs but to reduce their demand and to cut off their 
supply. 
  ``The danger I see in legalising drugs is that it will send 
precisely the wrong signals to young people. It would appear to 
make drugs socially acceptable and might be likely to spread 
their use. I can see there are arguments both ways. 
  ``We have to reduce the demand and cut off the supply. The 
drugs issue is a higher priority for us. A lot has been 
happening across Government. But I need it to be more focused.'' 
<H5>  Compensation: `Awards Based on a Very Odd Directive' </H5>
  Asked about some of the recent high compensation awards to 
servicewomen who lost their jobs because of pregnancy, Mr Major 
said: ``It is a very odd and old European directive that is the 
basis of this -- a 1978 directive, accepted by the then Labour 
Government accepting everything put to them, just as the current 
Labour opposition appear to be willing to in the future. 
  ``One or two cases have been highlighted and many people 
think they are very silly. They are rulings by an industrial 
tribunal and are under consideration by the courts.'' 
  "Of the 4,000 valid claims, over 2,000 have been settled at 
around 7,000 pounds a time. A few have produced these out 
landish figures and they are the subject of court consideration 
at the moment. There is nothing more we can say until we have 
the judgment."
