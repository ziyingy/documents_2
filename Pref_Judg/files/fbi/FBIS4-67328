<F P=106> [`eli'-signed report: "Conflict Between Bonn and </F>
SPD-Governed Laender; Coalition Sticks to Hard Drugs Ban"] 
  [Text] Bonn -- The first conflict seems to be developing 
between the government and a few laender governed by the SPD 
[Social Democratic Party of Germany] on the subject of future 
drugs policy. On Tuesday [17 May], the coalition talks 
consisting of leading Union [Christian Social Union and 
Christian Democratic Union] and FDP [Free Democratic Party] 
politicians decided against the implementation of a far-reaching 
drugs policy like the one in North-Rhine Westphalia. In the 
nearest future, a working group is to decide whether a 
German-wide legal amendment is required in order to keep the 
possession of hard drugs punishable. In North Rhine-Westphalia 
and Schleswig-Holstein, the possession of small quantities of 
heroin and cocaine has recently been legalized. One can even 
buy up to 30 grams of hashish before the law intervenes. 
  CSU [Christian Social Union] Land Group Chief Michael Gros 
expressed criticism of North Rhine-Westphalian Minister 
President Johannes Rau. "It is quite wrong for Rau to remain 
silent about the policy of his own justice minister, Rolf 
Krumsiek," said Gros, who described this policy as a "political 
dare-devil escapade." As a presidential candidate, Rau is 
supposed to bear responsibility for "the whole of German youth," 
said Gros. The coalition talks avoided any criticism of Rau, 
but spoke out firmly against the availability of hard drugs. 
The coalition believes that hard drugs will indeed be freely 
available in North Rhine-Westphalia. Therefore the drugs rule 
must be abolished, it was said. 
  A working group consisting of Health Minister Horst Seehofer 
(CSU), Justice Minister Sabine Leutheusser-Schnarrenberger 
(FDP), and Interior Minister Manfed Kanther (Christian 
Democratic Union, CDU) is to establish soon whether the law on 
intoxicating substances should be changed. One of the 
provisions of this law says that drug consumers must not 
necessarily be prosecuted if no damage to public interests is 
detectable or the perpetrator's guilt seems "slight." This is 
the case when drugs are used exclusively for private consumption. 
  Unlike in the case of North Rhine-Westphalia, the coalition 
has so far not expressed any criticism of the drugs policy of 
the Schleswig-Holstein government, which adopted a ruling last 
week whereby the acquisition and possession of up to one gram of 
heroin and up to five grams of cocaine and amphetamines is not 
punishable, just like in North Rhine-Westphalia. People can 
even possess up to 30 grams of cannabis products. In North 
Rhine-Westphalia, the upper limit on cannabis is 10 grams. 
There are still no upper limits in Lower Saxony, where it is up 
to the prosecution to decide whether or not drugs are consumed 
for private purposes. 
  The debate on drugs policy was initiated by a Constitutional 
Court ruling which allows law-enforcement bodies to quash cases 
of drug consumption without actually sanctioning this 
consumption explicitly. The Court has said several times that 
it never meant to permit the consumption of hashish. 
Nevertheless prosecution can be waived in petty cases. In 
addition, the Court recommended the working out of uniform rules 
concerning drug consumption applicable to the entire republic. 
The justice ministers conference in Hamburg at the beginning of 
May decided that the above recommendation be implemented before 
summer. As a result, some laender, such as North 
Rhine-Westphalia, have produced preliminary rules. The justice 
ministers of the individual laender doubt whether these uniform 
German rules can be produced by the time of the 16 October 
elections. The justice ministry of North Rhine-Westphalia says 
there are major differences of opinion between northern and 
southern parts of the country on the subject of drugs. Hesse 
Justice Minister Christine Dennhardt and her Berlin colleague 
Lore-Maria Peschel-Gutzeit (SPD)--Berlin is governed by a 
CDU/SPD coalition--support North Rhine-Westphalia's policy. 
  Bavaria is opposed to a liberalization of drugs consumption, 
and wants life imprisonment for drug dealers. The Bavarian 
government has resolved to table a federal legal initiative 
empowering the courts to impose life imprisonment on drug 
dealers working in organized bands.
