<F P=106> [Unattributed article: "Lubbers Calls For Reintroduction of </F>
Border Checks"] 
  [Excerpt] Prime Minister Lubbers wants to reintroduce 
personal identity checks at the frontiers with Germany and 
Belgium. He said this was necessary to reduce the increasing 
numbers of asylum-seekers (who have no prospects for life) 
entering the Netherlands via these countries. Lubbers spoke of 
an "administrative emergency situation." 
  In a confidential letter to his fellow ministers on Monday 
14 
March the prime minister said among other things that 
"difficulties with expulsion (of rejected asylum-seekers, etc.) 
make it necessary to stop them from entering the Netherlands." 
The prime minister's proposal diverges from the intention to 
achieve open borders within Europe. Lubbers said this measure 
was necessary because the Schengen Treaty, which would oblige 
Germany to take back asylum-seekers, was not yet applicable. 
"What is involved is fixed check points and flying brigades in 
border areas, which must be reintroduced, at least until 
Schengen has actually taken effect," Lubbers wrote. [passage
