  [Text] Jinan, April 26 (XINHUA) -- A robot paint-spray 
processing line was last week formally set in motion in the 
Weifang Diesel Engine Plant in east China's Shandong Province. 
  The plant is understood to be the first Chinese enterprise 
in 
that industry to employ robots on its production line. 
  The line, imported from the United States, can automatically 
wash, paint-spray and dry a diesel engine in ten minutes, and 
can handle 20,000 a year. 
  Plant officials said the line would greatly enhance its 
working efficiency and improve its employees' working conditions. 
  The plant, a major diesel engine manufacturer in China, 
produced 10,080 diesel engines, and a sales income of 775 
million yuan, in 1993. 
  In another development, Weifang, where the plant is located, 
has become one of the biggest manufacturing centers of diesel 
engines and farm machinery in China. 
  The city now produces 100,000 farm tractors, 30,000 farm 
trucks and 200,000 three-wheelers for farms in a year, local 
sources said. 
  Weifang is also known for its long tradition of kite art and 
annual international kite fairs.
