  [Text] Papal Nuncio Monsignor Paolo Romeo said that the 
prosecutor general has no authority to interfere in church 
matters or to investigate any of its bishops. Prosecutor 
General Gustavo de Greiff said the investigations will continue. 
  [Begin recording] [de Greiff] We are studying that. Msgr. 
Paolo Romeo argues his point, and the Attorney General's Office 
says the Concordat is not in effect. We must study these things 
in detail and make a decision at the proper time. 
  [Unidentified reporter] Will the investigations against the 
bishops continue? 
  [De Greiff] Yes. [end recording] 
  Regarding the drug legalization issue, the prosecutor 
general 
said: 
  [Begin de Greiff recording] That is not the government's 
position. It is my position in light of the failure of the 
methods being used to fight drug trafficking by which the 
producing and trading counties carry all the weight, while 
consumer nations do very little. I think this is the only 
solution, but it is something that must be studied. [end 
recording] 
  Regarding possible U.S. reactions to his position, de Greiff 
said: 
  [Begin de Greiff recording] I do not think they would be as 
imperialistic as to do that. Nevertheless, if they did it, we 
would judge them. [end recording]
