  [Text] The State Duma Russia's Choice group "received with 
interest and understanding the proposal advanced by Kazakh 
President Nursultan Nazarbayev on the setting up of a Euro-Asian 
union" but was convinced that the formation of such a union was 
impossible without tenacious efforts by legislative and 
executive bodies, politicians and businessmen in the countries 
that might join the union, says the group's statement made 
public Thursday. 
  The statement insisted that to make such a union possible 
"the economic systems of our countries have to converge, customs 
and monetary unions set up and legislations brought into line 
with one another." 
  Russia's Choice did not back the introduction of a 
transnational currency while "the Russian ruble has been fairly 
successfully performing this function" or the setting up of a 
transnational bank. 
  One essential condition for the integration processes to 
succeed, Russia's Choice felt, was that "closer ties between the 
states and formation of unions should not harm the economic 
interests of the Russians."
