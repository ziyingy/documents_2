  [Text] Jinan, 2 Apr (ZHONGGUO TONGXUN SHE)--According to 
statistics from the department concerned, there was a serious 
imbalance between the two sexes of babies born in Zaozhuang City 
of Shandong Province. The ratio of boy babies to girl babies 
was 144.6 to 100; and the ratio in Tengzhou City, which is 
subordinate to Zaozhuang, was 163.8 to 100. 
  According to analysis, a major reason for the serious sex 
imbalance among babies was the use of the ultrasound B test. 
Many people use this technology to determine the sex of embryos 
so that they can keep boy babies and abort female embryos. 
  In view of this situation, the Zaozhuang City CPC Committee 
recently ordered that if Communist Party members receive or 
administer ultrasound tests, they will be expelled from the 
party. The same offense will cause state cadres and workers in 
state-owned institutions to be dismissed.
