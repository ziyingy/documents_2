  [Text] The International Drug Control Board has pointed out 
that little or nothing has been done to fight drug trafficking 
in Colombia. We asked presidential candidates and hopefuls, if 
elected, how would they confront the problem? How would they 
fight drug trafficking in the country? 
  [Begin recording] 
  Liberal Party presidential hopeful Ernesto Samper: 
The policy that President Cesar Gaviria has been implementing is 
the best: demobilizing the drug cartels and subjecting them to 
the law by offering them a safe prison and a fair trial. 
Legalizing drugs is Colombia is not viable right now because 
people might interpret it as granting amnesty to drug 
trafficking. 
  Conservative Party presidential candidate Andres 
Pastrana: I insist it cannot be legalized. Statistics from 
the countries that have legalized drugs or from the U.S. states 
that have legalized marijuana always show that consumption has 
increased. This is why I insist on education and prevention 
programs. 
  Liberal Party presidential hopeful Humerto De la 
Calle: I say we should broaden drug trafficking policies to 
ensure that developed countries, in particular, become more 
efficient at controlling consumption, money laundering, 
precursor chemicals, and weapons. [end recording]
