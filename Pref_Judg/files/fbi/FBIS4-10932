  [Text] Buenos Aires, 19 Apr (NA) -- An Argentine Navy task 
force captured four vessels flying the Korean flag that were 
fishing illegally in the exclusive economic zone within 
Argentine jurisdictional waters in the area of Port Deseado. 
  The capture was made on 18 April by the corvettes Espora, 
Rosales, Spiro, and Parker, which were patrolling when they 
discovered the foreign vessels fishing in Argentina's exclusive 
economic zone, some 190 miles east of Port Deseado. 
  The Argentine units captured the fishing vessels "Petero 
301," "Petero 303," and the "Jaiwgon," and later the "Dongwon 
311," all of them flying the Korean flag. 
  When ordered to heave to, the "Dongwon 311" did not obey the 
Espora's order to stop, and continued to flee despite the firing 
of warning shots until it decided to heave to. 
  The vessels' crews were taken to port and placed at the 
disposal of authorities, who will take the appropriate measures 
in accordance with the law.
