  [Excerpts] Landshut (DPA) -- In the opinion of the Public 
Prosecutor's Office in Landshut, the controversial statements by 
Franz Schoenhuber, chairman of the extreme-right Republikaner, 
about Ignatz Bubis, chairman of the Central Council of Jews in 
Germany, do not amount to instigation of people. Therefore, 
this authority will not prosecute Schoenhuber ex officio, the 
Public Prosecutor's Office reported on the occasion of the 
conclusion of the preliminary proceedings on Thursday [7 April]. 
A request for the lifting of Schoenhuber's immunity will not be 
submitted to the European Parliament, it was stated. [passage 
omitted] 
  The Public Prosecutor's Office substantiated this by saying 
that Schoenhuber did not instigate people because he did not 
turn against an entire population group. The remarks were "only 
directed against Mr. Bubis and Mr. Friedman in particular," the 
chairman of the Jewish community in Frankfurt/Main. This cannot 
be generally regarded "as a statement about the Jews living in 
Germany."
