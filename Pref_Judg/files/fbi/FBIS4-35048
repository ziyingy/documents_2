  [Text] Buenos Aires, 26 Jun (EFE) -- Argentine Vice Foreign 
Minister Fernando Petrella today guaranteed that Argentina would 
not accept any oil exploitation in the Malvinas Islands if this 
activity created unilateral problems harming its stance in the 
dispute over the sovereignty of the islands. 
  Petrella told the Argentine DYN news agency: "Oil is very 
important, but is not of paramount importance, as there is oil 
everywhere. This does not, however, mean that we are giving it 
away to the British." 
  In Petrella's opinion, the possible oil activities in the 
islands "create problems, as there might exist jurisdiction 
issues harming the Argentine stance, and this is unacceptable." 
  In this regard, the vice minister mentioned the High-Level 
Group of Argentine and British officials who will meet on 14 and 
15 July in the city of Buenos Aires to discuss issues of 
bilateral interest, including oil. 
  In Petrella's opinion, the formation of this group involved 
the establishment of an important link between the two 
countries, which have decided to work on the sovereignty issue 
and recognize the existence of a dispute.
