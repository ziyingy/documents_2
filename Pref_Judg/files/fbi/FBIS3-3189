  Since the normalization of relations between China and 
Vietnam, border trade has developed very rapidly, while criminal 
activities, including gun- and drug-smuggling, have also 
increased. Since June last year, Guangxi frontier guards, in 
152 cases, have seized 1,463 firearms, 7,179 bullets, 418 
grenades, 69.037 kg of opium and 7.099 kg of heroin, and smashed 
49 criminal rings involving 239 persons. Ding Tingmu, executive 
deputy secretary of the regional party committee, said that the 
fight facing the region was arduous since there was a land and 
sea border of over 2,000 km. (Summary) (Beijing ZHONGGUO XINWEN

  Two fishermen carried 6 million yuan in forged notes, 
printed 
with a 1980 plate and with a face value of 100 yuan each, from 
Keelung Port, anchoring on 8 March at an anchoring point for 
Taiwan vessels in Putian's Wenjia Port, using the excuse of 
sheltering from a typhoon. On 9 March, officers and men of the 
Putian Frontier Detachment under the Fujian Provincial Armed 
Police Frontier Headquarters discovered four paper cartons on 
the deck containing the forged notes. The Taiwan fishing boat 
involved was detained and the two fishermen were also detained 
for trial. This is the first major forged Renminbi case cracked 
by the frontier guards of the public security departments this 
year. (Summary) (Hong Kong ZHONGGUO TONGXUN SHE in Chinese 0830

  The Ministry of Public Security says 1.21 million criminal 
cases were cracked in 1993, of which 370,000 were serious and 
important, with detection rates rising 6.8 and 3 percent 
respectively compared with 1992. Cash and goods worth 3.95 
billion yuan were recovered. 
  The ministry launched a series of campaigns against train 
robbers and highwaymen, criminal gangs, criminals involved in 
abducting and selling women and children, drug and firearms 
traffickers, economic criminals, smugglers and snakeheads 
(traffickers in illegal emigrants), and those engaged in 
transnational and transregional crime. In 1993, 21,000 "train 
and highway banditry" cases and a number of cases of abducting 
and selling women and children were solved. Some 4,000 kg of 
heroin and 3,000 kg of opium were seized in 14,000 cases, and a 
number of criminal gangs were broken up. A number of criminals 
involved in transnational and transregional crime were 
prosecuted, and 20 felons from foreign countries or from outside 
the borders were extradited. 
  The ministry has urged cracking down on murderers, robbers, 
thieves, and organized crime, and truly maintaining social 
security and stability, thus creating a more favorable social 
environment for reform and economic construction. (Summary)

  The State Administration for Industry and Commerce says some 
159,750 economic cases were dealt with last year, with 29,942 of 
them, or 18.74 percent, described as big and serious. Twenty 
provinces have seen a rise in the number of big economic crimes, 
with such cases in Hebei, Liaoning, Shandong, and Yunnan 
increasing by 300 percent. Fines imposed for such crimes in 
each of Shandong, Guangdong and Fujian amounted to more than 100 
million yuan. 
  Economic crimes in state-owned and in collectively owned 
units increased by 13.93 percent and 5.75 percent respectively, 
with the number of big cases in these units making up 62.57 
percent of all big cases. Most of such cases involved smuggling 
and counterfeiting and production of low-quality products. A 
case involving illegal stock dealing was discovered in Shanghai 
late last year and 72 cases of underground foreign exchange 
speculation were dealt with in Shenzhen, with fines totaling 
more than 2 million yuan. 
  The number of such cases increased to a great extent in the 
northern coastal regions, but decreased in the southern coastal 
regions, with Fujian seeing a decrease of 50 percent. The 
number of big cases, however, increased by 92.7 percent, with 
greater fines. (Summary) (Beijing ZHONGGUO XINWEN SHE in English

  This year, police in Fujian's Quanzhou City have cracked 
down 
on five cases of firearms trafficking. Police discovered that 
criminals had used express mail to send firearms, so they kept a 
close watch on the city's post offices. At the end of March, 
Licheng neighborhood police detected 50 steel-ball guns and 100 
rounds of ammunition in the posts and telecommunications office, 
and swiftly arrested the sender and the receiver of the parcels. 
Police said most guns came from the lower reaches of the Chang 
Jiang. (Summary) (Hong Kong ZHONGGUO TONGXUN SHE in Chinese 0702

  The Guangdong Provincial Higher People's Court said recently 
that the courts had taken firm measures against highway and 
railway robbers. Last year 2,202 cases were tried, involving 
more than 4,000 criminals, of whom 3,040 were sentenced to 
either prison terms exceeding five years, life imprisonment, or 
death. In 1990, courts throughout the province handled 1,428 
such cases, but the number increased to 2,202 in 1993, up 54 
percent. Such crimes accounted for 8 percent of all criminal 
cases in 1990, but rose to 11.7 percent in 1993. Zheng Hanlai

year identified violations of law and discipline involving

  Hunan 
  Zhan Shunchu, president of the Hunan Higher People's Court, 
said recently that in a drive launched in the middle of last 
October, the courts have sentenced 8,078 criminal offenders, of 
whom 2,873 were sentenced to five years or more imprisonment and 
587 local ruffians and despots were sentenced to life 
imprisonment or death, thus offering a fine social order. 
  In view of the large numbers of murder and injury cases, 
repeated occurrences of waylaying by highwaymen and waterway 
gangsters, and increasing numbers of cases of disruption of 
agricultural production and the peasants' livelihood, Hunan 
party committee and government decided on a province-wide battle 
to improve social order in the rural areas. The attack is 
focused on hooliganism, robbery, murder, deliberate injury, 
rape, and abduction of women and children; sabotaging production 
and stealing communications equipment, farmland and irrigation 
facilities, and property of the state, collectives, and 
individuals; inciting fighting between clans and creating 
trouble among the masses; beating and retaliating against 
basic-level cadres, officers of the political and legal organs, 
and law enforcement personnel; illegal possession of rifles and 
smuggling and selling ammunition; and other serious crimes, 
which gravely harm social order. From 20 to 31 January this 
year, 14 prefectural and city courts throughout the province 
held 137 rallies to sentence more than 2,700 criminal offenders 
according to law. (Summary) (Beijing FAZHI RIBAO in Chinese 28

Inner Mongolia 
  The Tuoketuo Public Security Bureau in Hohot, Inner 
Mongolia, 
recently smashed a major human smuggling ring. By the end of 
January 59 suspects had been detained, of whom 22 were arrested. 
  Li Daichun and Li Dailin, natives of Sichuan's Fengxi 
County, 
are the principal offenders. With Li Dailin's wife Huang Yan, 
Li's sister-in-law Xie Suqing, and 11 others, in the name of 
recruiting people, they abducted more than 200 women from 
Sichuan, Yunnan, and Guizhou to Inner Mongolia and sold them to 
human smugglers there for over 800,000 yuan. When the first 
trader of the ring found some women, he contacted the local 
smuggler. After the women were escorted to Inner Mongolia, they 
were sold at a low price to the second trader, who would 
transfer them elsewhere by truck and sell them to third and 
fourth traders. 
  The Tuoketuo Public Security Bureau has arrested 245 human 
smugglers since 1989 and saved more than 160 victims. (Summary)

  Chengdu police recently cracked a large drug-trafficking 
case, seizing 26.9 kg of heroin and arresting 18 criminals. On 
28 August 1993, police in Jinmu District, Chengdu learned of a

taking the number of policemen on the case to over 100. The 
case was finally settled after over 170 days of efforts. The 
gang comprised elements from Yunnan, Sichuan, and Guangdong.

  In view of the rampant criminal activities of ancient tomb 
excavation and smuggling of cultural relics in recent years, the
