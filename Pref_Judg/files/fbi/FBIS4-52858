  [Text] Tokyo, May 14 KYODO -- Chinese Mafia bosses in Hong 
Kong and Taiwan are controlling the so-called "snake head" 
organization which smuggles Chinese workers into Japan, National 
Police Agency sources said Saturday [14 May]. 
  The organization is well-commanded, with several executives 
supporting the boss. Chinese henchmen lure farmers and 
fishermen to work in Japan, the sources said. 
  In cases of Chinese illegally entering Japan in groups, only 
18 in two groups arrived in 1990, but the number has sharply 
increased, to 396 in 14 groups in 1992 and 335 in seven groups 
in 1993. 
  This year, over 250 Chinese in eight groups have already 
been 
smuggled into Japan, including a group of nearly 100 that 
arrived in Shimane Prefecture on a freighter this week, they 
said. 
  The "snake head" organization arranges various methods for 
illegal entry, such as traveling hidden on fishing boats and 
freighters or with forged passports, they said. 
  After they arrive in Japan, residents from either China, 
Hong 
Kong or Taiwan or Japanese "yakuza" gangs guide the workers. 
  The illegal immigrants pay about 200,000 yen as security to 
gain entry, paying more after the attempt succeeds, the sources 
said. 
  The primary targets of the organization are farmers in 
suburban areas and fishermen working in aquiculture, and those 
who hope to work in Japan to make more money, they said. 
  "Snake head" members lure them with the promise of a safe 
and 
comfortable journey, but they are actually packed in the hold of 
freighters and are only given instant noodles twice a day, they 
said. 
  The organization sometimes holds the illegal entrants in 
Japan until they pay the remaining fee, or abandons them without 
giving them job they were promised, the sources said.
