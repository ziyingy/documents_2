  [Text] Paris, Dec 20 (AFP) -- France changed its mind 
Monday [20 December] about a complete ban on dumping nuclear 
waste at sea and is to sign the convention drafted in London 
last month, Environment Minister Michel Barnier said. 
  France was among five countries which abstained at the time, 
while 37 nations voted for a total ban on disposing of even weak 
radioactive waste at sea. 
  France has not done such dumping for many years. Barnier 
said in a radio interview that Prime Minister Edouard Balladur 
had decided France should continue to set a good example and 
would sign the convention along with the majority of countries. 
  Other abstainers to date include Britain, Russia and China.
