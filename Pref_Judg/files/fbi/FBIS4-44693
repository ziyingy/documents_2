  [Text] The Federal Research Ministry is granting a total 
of 150 million German marks [DM] in subsidies towards the 
construction of the "Sciamachy" (Scanning Imaging Absorption 
Spectrometer for Atmospheric Cartography) remote sensing 
instrument, DM50 million of which will be to process the data 
for use. At the same time, the Netherlands are providing about 
75 million guilders [hfl]. 
  A cooperation agreement to this effect was signed yesterday 
by the German Space Agency (DARA) Managing Director Jan Baldem 
Mennicken and the Dutch Aircraft Development and Aerospace 
Institute (NIVR) Chairman von Ardenne. The bilateral project 
will be a major step in the joint efforts to make greater use of 
aerospace technology in international cooperation for 
environmental research, State Secretary of Federal Research and 
Technology Ministry Gebhard Ziller stated. 
  It also increased the joint commitment of both nations to 
satellite-based Earth observation. German-Dutch cooperation in 
developing Sciamachy was an outstanding example of European 
cooperation on a space program, Ziller said. 
  Sciamachy will measure traces of gases, of great importance 
particularly for ozone depletion and the greenhouse effect in 
the atmosphere. Developed by German and Dutch scientists and 
firms since 1989, the Sciamachy absorption spectrometer will be 
used in the European Space Agency (ESA)'s "ENVISAT-1" mission 
planned for 1998. The ENVISAT-1 environmental satellite's 
complex payload is designed to observe the atmosphere, the 
oceans, land surface, and the polar ice caps. 
  ENVISAT is being developed by a European consortium headed 
by 
a German firm. The ENVISAT mission is part of the international 
"Mission to Planet Earth" initiative and will give Europe a 
fresh opportunity to consolidate its technological lead in Earth 
exploration, DARA reports. Two instruments developed in Germany 
for observing the Earth's atmosphere have already been installed 
on it.
