  [Text] Faced with criticism triggered by the Cali Cartel 
surrender process, the Prosecutor General's Office has issued a 
communique. The communique from the prosecutor general contains 
seven specific points: 
  1. His activities have been directed at the fight against 
all 
manifestations of crime. The destruction of the Medellin Cartel 
was due to constant work by the Prosecutor General's Office. 
  3. [Number as heard] All the work of the Prosecutor 
General's 
Office has been carried out within the framework of the penal 
code and the law recently reformed by Congress with full 
knowledge of the government. 
  4. The specific objective of the criticism regarding the 
spiritless contribution of consumer countries to the fight 
against drug-trafficking is to fight that illegal activity. 
  The final point of the communique notes the legalization of 
some drugs could become a deadly weapon capable of depriving 
drug traffickers of profits. The prosecutor general concluded 
the communique by stating he would rather die than live in a 
country where criminals can decide who will be the country's 
government officials and judges.
