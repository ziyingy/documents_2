  [Text] Police said yesterday they plan to arrest a former 
drug adviser to ex-U.S. President Jimmy Carter who was 
photographed in Burma wearing the uniform of opium warlord Khun 
Sa's hilltribe army. 
  Lt-Colonel Supachai Sirisap, deputy head of the Foreign 
Affairs Division of the Royal Thai Police said: 
  "It is our intention to arrest him when we see him. He 
appears to have crossed the Burmese border illegally from 
Thailand." 
  The statement came after a spokesman for the United States 
embassy said that Peter Bourne, former adviser on narcotics to 
the Carter administration, was indeed the man photographed and 
identified in the Bangkok Post on Sunday as "Peter Bond". 
  A United States embassy spokesman said: 
  "He is not in Burma on any official business of the United 
States Government." 
  "As far as we are concerned Khun Sa is the single biggest 
heroin dealer in Burma and we have warrants out for his arrest," 
the U.S. embassy spokesman said. 
  Khun Sa has offered to sell the United States his annual 
opium crop numerous times in the past as part of his own plan to 
help eradicate the world of heroin. 
  The United States has refused to deal with him despite 
previous visits by Congressman Lester Wolf. 
  Bourne was relieved of his job as presidential adviser on 
narcotics after allegedly abusing his position. 
  Peter Bourne, aged 60, however was rumoured to have 
re-entered Thailand and departed on a U.S.-bound flight on 
Sunday night.
