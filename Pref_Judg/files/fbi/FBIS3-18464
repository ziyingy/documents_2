  [Text] National Defense Minister Yerasimos Artemis today 
gave the appraisal that, following the incident of the aircraft 
downing in Bosnia, the situation has been defused. He also 
stressed the role of the peace forces in promoting a political 
solution to the issue. 
  Responding to a question from correspondents, Mr. Arsenis 
stressed that the National Defense Ministry is in a state of 
heightened alertness and there is no reason for concern. 
However, the national defense minister did not rule out 
incidents and explosions in the Balkans since, as he put it, the 
peace process will take time. 
  Commenting on the way in which NATO acted, Mr. Arsenis 
expressed the view that the process of decision-making within 
the organization's framework must be discussed at the spring 
meeting of the defense ministers.
