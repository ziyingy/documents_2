  [Text] To date, the human race has been using up fossil 
fuel as if it were an infinite energy source. Today, the end of 
the energy source has begun to appear, and the source is 
expected to dry up in the second half of the 21st century. 
Carbon dioxide (CO[.sub]2[/]), the product of fuel 
consumption, is causing the global warming trend. If 
CO[.sub]2[/] is recovered and stored on a global scale, it 
may be possible to re-utilize it as a post-fossil energy source 
by converting the gas into C-compounds with yet-to-be-developed 
efficient technology. Although the deep sea isolation and 
underground press-in methods had previously been proposed for 
the large-scale storage of CO[.sub]2[/], the Government 
Industrial Research Institute (GIRI; director: Mr. Reikichi 
Iwamoto), Osaka, of the Agency of Industrial Science and 
Technology, presented a new proposal at the October meeting of 
the Japan Society of Chemical Engineers: ``CO[.sub]2[/] 
generated by the entire world over a span of 10,000 years can be 
stored in the ice bed at the South Pole.'' The proposal, which 
can be simply implemented, drew special attention. 
<H5>  Annual Emission Close to 20 Billion Tons </H5>
  The worldwide emission of CO[.sub]2[/] amounts to nearly 
20 billion tons. Previously, the deep sea isolation method, the 
method of increasing yield or recovering crude oil from spent 
oil fields (EOR), and the method of placing the gas underground, 
such as into exhausted natural gas fields and subterranean 
aquifers, had been considered for large-scale storage of carbon 
dioxide. However, none of those methods were practical, because 
there is not enough storage capacity or there is a lack of data 
concerning the effects of CO[.sub]2[/] in sea water and in 
the ground. 
  According to the proposed deep sea isolation method, 
CO[.sub]2[/] is to be either liquified or solidified and 
isolated in the sea at depths of 3,000 meters or more. When 
CO[.sub]2[/] is dissolved in sea water, its hydrogen ion 
concentration (pH) decreases, and it can affect an ecological 
environment through diffusion. The method of pressing 
CO[.sub]2[/] into subterranean aquifers involves the 
pressurization of the gas into aquifers that are 2,000 meters or 
more deep and are salt-rich. Carboxyl ions formed as a result of 
the dissolution of CO[.sub]2[/] in water will diffuse into 
soil and rocky crevices. There is much to be studied about the 
effects of CO[.sub]2[/] in soil. The spent-oil-field EOR 
method permits the storage of only 63 billion tons of carbon 
dioxide, which would be filled up in just three years. The lack 
of storage capacity is also a problem with the storage method 
using exhausted natural gas fields, which is implemented on a 
small scale with a storage capacity of 180 billion tons, good 
for about nine years. 
<H5>  Below Sublimation Point of Dry Ice </H5>
  Chief Researcher Takako Honjo of the Energy Conversion 
Material Department of GIRI, Osaka, who is in charge of the 
South Pole ice bed storage method research project, insists that 
``the South Pole has advantages for storing a huge amount of 
carbon dioxide in a recyclable state for a long time.'' 
Calculated from the size of the ice bed, the storage capacity is 
ample for the worldwide CO[.sub]2[/] emission for 100 
centuries. Not technically difficult, the method involves 
drilling holes in the South Pole ice bed and storing 
CO[.sub]2[/] in a solid form (dry ice). It is sensible to 
utilize holes in the South Pole's ice bed which are at 
temperatures below the sublimation point of dry ice, i.e., - 
78xC. Ice can be found in the cave in the lava plateau of Mount 
Fuji, the ``Wind Cave of Fuji,'' even in the summer season. This 
is possible because the air inside the Wind Cave remains at the 
lowest temperature annually based on the principle of the 
downward cave. In the winter, cold, heavy air on the ground 
moves into the cave; in the summer, warm air cannot enter the 
cave because it is light. Despite the high, average outside air 
temperature and its wide fluctuation, the cave can selectively 
maintain a minimum air temperature. On the ice bed of the South 
Pole, the annual minimum air temperature easily reaches below 
-78xC. Therefore, if ``downward caves,'' like the Wind Cave of 
Fuji, are dug out, dry ice can be stored permanently without any 
concern whatsoever about the evaporation problem, the most 
serious problem in long-term storage of CO[.sub]2[/]. 
<H5>  Problem: How to Transport to South Pole </H5>
  Under current consideration as a model is the ice bed 
plateau 
in the interior of Antarctica. The Area has a practically 
infinite storage capacity for a worldwide CO[.sub]2[/] 
emission quantity lasting for more than 100 centuries. Moreover, 
unlike coastal ice beds, the ice bed plateau moves at an 
extremely slow rate of one meter over several tens of thousands 
years to make the movement of a facility negligible. Based on 
the experience of drilling to a depth of 700 meters through the 
ice bed at Japan's Mizuho Antarctica Base, it is technically 
quite feasible to drill 200-m- deep caves. The problem is how to 
transport recovered CO[.sub]2[/] to the South Pole. For the 
time being, tankers exclusively for CO[.sub]2[/] are being 
considered, although the state of CO[.sub]2[/], liquid or 
solid, has not yet been decided. Furthermore, such an ice-bed 
storage method, if scaled down, can be adopted in other regions. 
Thus, it is possible to see earlier implementation of this 
method in places like Greenland, where CO[.sub]2[/]-consuming 
regions are nearby.
