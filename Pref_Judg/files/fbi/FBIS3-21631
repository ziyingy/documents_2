<F P=106> [Interview with Colombian Prosecutor General Gustavo de </F>
Greiff by Felix de Bedout on 26 February; place not given; from 
the "NTC News" newscast--live] 
  [Excerpt] [De Bedout] Prosecutor General, what progress was 
made toward the surrender of Cali Cartel members during the 
meeting held yesterday? 
  [De Greiff] We made significant progress in stipulating the 
guidelines for cooperation and settling the details regarding 
the prison where they will stay. 
  [De Bedout] Which prison will it be? 
  [De Greiff] I think it will be one of the two 
maximum-security prisons that already exist in Valle Department, 
such as Palmira and Cali. 
  [De Bedout] This surrender process has been very 
controversial. Has the Prosecutor General's Office gone out of 
its way to facilitate the conditions for Cali Cartel members to 
surrender? 
  [De Greiff] No, no. I believe that the criminals' surrender 
and incarceration will not only benefit the country, but we will 
also be making progress toward defeating drug trafficking. 
  In the United States--for reasons I do not understand very 
well--they believe the fight against drug trafficking is useless 
and that only drug traffickers should be targeted. They argue 
that ending drug trafficking is an impossible mission, so they 
say the best course is to fight drug traffickers and try to stop 
as many of them as possible. Thus their war against drug 
trafficking has not been very successful. 
  I believe that both objectives--that drug traffickers pay 
for 
their crimes against society and that efforts be made to end 
drug trafficking--should be tackled. In Colombia's current 
situation--and we are not being naive or too optimistic--we 
might be able to defeat drug trafficking, at least in some areas 
of the country. In addition, we might be able to reduce the 
territory of those drug traffickers who want to continue their 
criminal activities. Gradually we can continue fighting them 
and reducing their territory even further until eventually--God 
willing--we can defeat this scourge. 
  [De Bedout] But do you believe that legalization would 
constitute a definitive cure? 
  [De Greiff] This issue requires more time and more research 
by economists, sociologists, doctors, chemists. I have only 
said that legalization is a possibility that must be considered. 
We must destroy the profits made by drug traffickers so this 
crime becomes less tempting and is eventually stamped out. 
  I reiterate: Colombia cannot do this unilaterally; it must 
be a multilateral action. We must promote research regarding 
this possibility and in the meantime continue our relentless 
fight on both fronts: against drug traffickers and drug 
trafficking. [passage omitted]
