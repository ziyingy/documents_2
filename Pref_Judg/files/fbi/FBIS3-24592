  [Abstract] Based on expeditions to the Gulf of Taganrog in 
1989 and 1992, the distribution of the most common pollutants in 
this region are analyzed (petroleum products, chlor-, nitro-, 
and alkyl phenols, anionic, cationic, and nonionogenic 
surfactants, sym-triazine pesticides, and heavy metals). Sea 
water, pollutants in suspension, and bottom sediments were 
studied. Phenols, methyl thiotriazines, cadmium, and copper are 
mostly in solution, while nickel, chlortriazine, and cationic 
surfactants are in suspension. Petroleum hydrocarbons, lead, and 
anionic and nonionogenic surfactants are found in the sea in 
these forms in comparable quantities. Estimates are given of 
contamination of bottom sediments with these substances. 
Herbicides are concentrated in the surface layer. Surface layer 
concentrations vary widely. Figures 3; tables 3; references 4: 2
