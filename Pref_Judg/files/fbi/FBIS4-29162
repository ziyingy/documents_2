  [Text] Australia's space research program has taken a step 
forward with the opening of an earth resources satellite station 
in Hobart. The $2.7 million [Australian dollars] facility was 
built by the University of Tasmania; the federal government's 
scientific research organization, the CSIRO [Commonwealth 
Scientific and Industrial Research Organization]; and the 
Australian Space Council. 
  (Don Chocran) of the Space Council says the station will be 
used to receive information from space on the state of the 
earth, including oceans, weather pattern, and temperatures: 
  [Begin (Chocran) recording] The ground station is used for 
receiving images from satellites in space -- those are optical 
images and radar images. And in addition to its use to 
monitoring the environment, it's also used as a backup for the 
Alice Springs station which receive data or images from space 
for monitoring our resources and our environment. [end recording]
