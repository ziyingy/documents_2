<F P=106> [Article by Delfin Arias Vargas: ``Environmental Battalion: </F>
First Step of `New' Armed Forces''] 
  [Text] On 20 December, once the final administrative and 
technical details of its mission are cleared up, the Army 
Environmental Battalion will be moved into the Ulla Ulla region. 
The Armed Forces will thus have taken the first and most 
fundamental step toward fulfilling their role in the country's 
new social and political reality. 
  After several months of study and evaluation of the 
functions 
to be performed by the Ulla Ulla headquarters, its installations 
will be inaugurated by the highest government and army 
officials. Other units similar to this battalion will 
subsequently be set up in other regions of the country, 
according to official Defense Ministry sources. 
  ``We are hopeful and that the service facilities required by 
this Ulla Ulla unit will be completed by 20 December, and are 
deeply gratified that this will enable the unit to begin its 
activities immediately,'' said Army commander in chief, General 
Reynaldo Caceres, in an upbeat tone, when asked about the matter. 
  The Ulla Ulla National Park Preserve contains within its 
territory, mainly, animals of endangered species, such as the 
vicuna, guanaco, and alpaca. These ``auquenidos'' [animals of 
genus Auchenia (synonym: Lama)] are hunted by 
poachers because of the high quality and commercial value of 
their wool. 
  This concern, and the need to make advantageous use of the 
military infrastructure and training, make the Armed Forces the 
appropriate institution to undertake the support of the 
country's integral development, as well as its defenses, and 
thus accomplish fully the Armed Forces' constitutional mission 
of safeguarding the nation's sovereignty and its natural 
resources, in accordance with guidelines laid down by the 
defense minister, Antonio Cespedes. 
  General Moises Shriqui, chief of staff of the Armed Forces, 
indicated recently that the funds the state earmarks for the 
Armed Forces will have to be reallocated to meet their highest 
priority needs, so that ``the institution does not neglect its 
constitutional mission of preserving the country's sovereignty 
and fulfills its responsibilities in support of the country's 
development.'' 
<H5>  Future Projects </H5>
  According to Defense Ministry sources, four social welfare 
projects similar to the Ulla Ulla project, to aid the 
inhabitants of the country's rural regions, and to be carried 
out by the Army, will be submitted to the Armed Forces high 
command for consideration in the coming weeks. 
  The announcement has the backing of the Army's commanding 
general, who stated that ``under our current plans, the 
environmental defense units are to be implemented gradually 
during the coming fiscal year, in accordance with the 
requirements and the missions the government may be assigning to 
us.'' 
  In keeping with this position, the Ulla Ulla headquarters is 
being established as the first military unit to assume 
responsibility for the defense of the environment, particularly 
in border regions, where, in the absence of control by the 
state, natural resources are being irrationally exploited by 
citizens of foreign countries and by Bolivians. 
<H5>  Plan for Camelidos </H5>
  In keeping with the military's new role as announced by the 
defense minister, a plan covering the breeding of ``camelidos'' 
[animals of the family Camelidae, which includes 
those of aforementioned genus Auchenia], and their 
commercial exploitation, was submitted, toward the end of last 
week, to officials of COFADENA [Armed Forces National 
Development Corporation]. This plan guarantees a rise in the 
altiplano farmers' incomes. 
  This project, like the others, will be supported by the 
participation of Army officers in a training capacity, and of 
Army draftees doing their military service. 
<H5>  Not Only Plan for Camelidos </H5>
  Sources consulted indicated that the military's new role 
will 
open the way in the valley regions for a project aimed at making 
use of hillsides to plant forage trees, which besides 
reforesting the area will supply firewood for the neighboring 
communities. 
  In the Chaco area, implementation of a plan is being 
advanced, again with military participation, calling for 
ecological management of the region, and the exploitation of its 
natural conditions of high temperature and dry climate during 
most of the year. 
  As explained by the experts whose opinion was sought and who 
work for the Defense Ministry, the planting of ``leuquena'' 
[lead tree, Leucaena glauca], a forage tree par 
excellence, which was also planted on the Abapo Izozog plains, 
although that agricultural development project was not 
completed, virtually guarantees positive results in the raising 
of goats and the production of milk. 
  Another project that will be considered by the Armed Forces 
concerns the preservation of the Moxos cattle country, in the 
Beni district, where more than 5 million hectares of cattle 
grazing land would benefit. It would include the application of 
techniques for sheltering cattle during periods of rain and the 
ensuing flooding. 
  Officials point out that, beginning in 1994, the 
above-mentioned assignments will impart to the Armed Forces the 
leading role in the nation's development.
