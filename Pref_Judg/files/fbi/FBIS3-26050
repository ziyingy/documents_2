  [Text] Lhasa, February 1 (XINHUA) -- About 100 Tibetans who 
returned from overseas in the past few years gathered in Lhasa 
today to celebrate the coming Tibetan new year. 
  Along with the opening-up and economic growth of the Tibet 
Autonomous Region, more and more overseas Tibetans are coming 
back to visit relatives, to sight-see and to resettle. Last 
year more than 100 families came back to settle down. 
  Tibetans living abroad have helped promote their hometown 
economies and improved local school and hospital facilities. 
  Tibetans are welcome to return to visit their relatives and 
settle down and they are free to come back and to leave again, 
Basang, a regional government official in charge of the 
reception of returned Tibetans, said at the gathering.
