  [Text] Brasilia -- The relationship between commerce and 
the environment, a matter about which international 
organizations, exporters, and the Brazilian Government have all 
been concerned, will be high on the agenda of a meeting 
sponsored by the United Nations Environment Program (PNUMA) and 
by the United Nations Commission for Trade and Development 
(UNCTAD), for 17 February in Geneva. 
  Environment and Legal Amazon Region Minister Rubens Ricupero 
was yesterday officially invited by Elizabeth Dedswell, PNUMA 
director, to preside over the Geneva meeting. The minister said 
it will be an opportunity to make an evaluation of the talks on 
the problem and on the progress made during the Uruguay Round of 
the General Agreement on Trade and Tariffs (GATT) talks, which 
were concluded on 15 December 1993. 
  In the opinion of Ricupero, the link between trade and 
environment and the so-called competition rules will be the two 
main topics of intenational economic discussions in the next few 
years. The Brazilian Government is getting ready to confront the 
various initiatives that are beginning to proliferate, like 
green stamps, special packaging standards, and European and U.S. 
laws aimed at preserving the environment and which affect 
Brazilian exports. 
<H5>  Interministerial Meeting </H5>
  An interministerial group headed by Winston Fritsch, the 
Finance Ministry secretary of economic policy, met at the 
ministry last week to discuss the problem of industrial policy 
from the viewpoint of Brazil's environmental commitments. Says 
Ricupero: ``We studied how the new industrial policy will have 
to adjust itself to rules such as the ISO 9000 standards, trying 
to prevent our competitiveness from being affected.'' 
  Ricupero will prepare a document outlining the Brazilian 
position. ``The Brazilian sectors with the heaviest weight 
among exports, like paper and cellulose, and iron and steel, are 
sensitive to the new requirements tied to environmental 
preservation,'' the minister said. ``We must give those sectors 
environmental standards in order to prevent them from becoming 
the victims of protectionist offensives,'' he said. 
<H5>  Coal </H5>
  The minister will go to Santa Catarina over the weekend to 
discuss the environmental impact of the coal industry. 
  According to Ricupero, in his ministry there exists the 
Pro-Vida program to help the industries of the sector recuperate 
deteriorated areas. 
  Within GATT there is a work group studying trade and its 
relationship with the environment. The group was created in 
1971. 
  The group met again only in 1991, and so far has held four 
or 
five meetings to address matters like the European Union's green 
stamp and labelling and packaging standards. ``This group will 
receive additional impulse'' in the the next few years, Ricupero 
said, because of the importance of the subject.
