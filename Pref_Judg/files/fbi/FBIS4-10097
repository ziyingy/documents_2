  [Text] Just when everyone thought the controversy between 
the Prosecutor General's Office and the Catholic Church was 
settled, today we learn about a letter in which Prosecutor 
General Gustavo de Greiff reaffirms his accusations, saying 
there are bishops in Colombia who operate as couriers for 
guerrilla groups. 
  Some of the paragraphs in the prosecutor general's letter to 
Monsignor Pedro Rubiano, president of the Colombian Episcopal 
Conference, state: Some of the bishops have become just that, 
meaning, individuals who deliver messages from guerrilla groups 
to the government and to the public in general. It is dangerous 
to describe the enormous mistake of providing criminals with 
excuses to justify their acts--as has been done by assuring them 
they can still be guerrilla members--as pastoral evangelization; 
this means in Colombia one can continue to murder, steal, 
kidnap, and torment the nation as long as poverty and economic 
and social problems prevail. 
  Finally, the prosecutor general expresses regret over the 
actions carried out by certain bishops, adding that when he 
returns from his vacation he will establish his position with 
regard to the office which will investigate the clergy in 
Colombia.
