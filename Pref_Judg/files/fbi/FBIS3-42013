  (Text] Dubna, 18 Jan -- A new nuclear accelerator operating 
through superconductivity and a new cyclotron -- these two major 
physics ``machines'' have been created and are operating at the 
Combined Nuclear Research Institute [CNRI] at Dubna near Moscow. 
This was announced today at a session of the CNRI's academic 
council, which is summing up last year's results and planning 
work for the future. 
  Despite the economic difficulties that science in Russia is 
experiencing, the CNRI is developing as a major international 
center in many fields, said Vladimir Kadyshevskiy, CNRI director 
and a corresponding member of the Russian Academy of Sciences. 
He noted that the institute had integrated basic research into 
the structure of matter, the designing and application of new 
technologies, and university teaching in the relevant fields of 
knowledge. 
  The institute's international courses last year on 
``Radiation safety: physical, medical, biological and ecological 
aspects (the lessons of Chernobyl)'' helped expand the subject 
matter of teaching at the CNRI university and the establishment 
of new contacts. Now documents are being prepared on the 
organization of a UNESCO-IAEA faculty in Dubna with the same 
specialization, and it is planned to organize a faculty of 
economics in cooperation with Moscow University. 
  Taking part in the work of the Scientific Council are 
experts 
from Germany, since a routine agreement has been concluded 
between the German Federal Ministry of Research and Technology 
and the CNRI on the use of the institute's installations up to 
the end of 1996. In this way physicists from one of the leading 
European states have shown an interest in the development of 
Dubna Physics Center.
