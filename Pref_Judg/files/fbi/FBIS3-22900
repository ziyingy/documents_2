  [Text] Tokyo, Feb. 23 KYODO -- Japan's Science and 
Technology Agency on Wednesday [23 February] welcomed a French 
Government decision to reopen France's Super Phenix Fast Breeder 
Nuclear Reactor as a research facility. 
  The French decision was made on the basis of a report from a 
public hearing into reopening the facility near Grenoble which 
ceased operating as a fast breeder reactor in 1990. 
  The report said the reactor could serve as a facility for 
experiments into nuclear waste reduction as well as leaving open 
the option of using it as a fast breeder reactor in the future. 
  An official at the agency said the continued use by France 
of 
its Super Phenix Reactor, even as a nuclear waste burning 
facility, would at least spare Japan from being put in a 
position where it is the only country outside Russia with a 
similar facility. 
  A plan also exists for Japan's Monju prototype fast breeder 
reactor in Tsuruga, Fukui Prefecture, to conduct experiments in 
waste incineration after it reaches criticality in April. 
  The plan is likely to be incorporated in the nation's 
long-term plan for nuclear power development now under revision. 
  Japan's nuclear power policy emphasizes the development of 
fast breeder technology.
