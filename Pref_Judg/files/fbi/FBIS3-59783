<H5>  Abstract </H5>
  In recent years electric vehicles (EVs) have attracted 
increasing attention. Mitsubishi Motors Corporation has recently 
developed, in succession to various types of EVs previously 
developed, a new EV (developed in cooperation with The Tokyo 
Electric Power Co., Ltd.) for commercial use which makes full 
use of a state-of-the-art motor, motor control and battery 
technologies. 
  This paper outlines the present status of Mitsubishi's EVs 
with respect to their driving performance, maximum traveling 
distance per battery charge, etc. and gives a brief overview of 
the expected future trend of EVs. 
  Key words: Electric Vehicle, Environment 
<H5>  1. Introduction </H5>
  Together with economic growth and achievement of a high 
standard of living in recent years, energy consumption has also 
seen a yearly increase, particularly in that large amounts of 
fossil fuel have been consumed. Under these circumstances, 
global environmental problems such as air pollution resulting 
from fossil fuel consumption, global warming resulting from 
increases in carbon dioxide, acid rain caused by the emission of 
sulfur dioxides into the atmosphere, and so forth have emerged 
as serious social problems. 
  Under these conditions, electric vehicles (EVs) which do not 
emit exhaust fumes are highly anticipated because they have the 
most potential as non-polluting vehicles. 
  In the United States, the California Air Resources Board has 
enacted a law that requires automakers to sell ZEVs 
(Zero-Emission-Vehicles = electric vehicles) at a certain rate 
from 1998 onward, and it has since commenced enforcing several 
restrictions for this purpose. In Japan, the Ministry of 
International Trade and Industry made their plans to popularize 
and foster EVs and has began preparing for completing related 
standards and certification procedures, while local 
self-governing bodies and electric power corporations are 
actively introducing EVs. 
  The following section will outline the present status and 
future development trends of EVs. 
<H5>  2. Present Status of Electric Vehicles </H5>
  The recent development of EVs in Japan has experienced its 
first boom when a large-scale inter-corporate project was 
commenced with the aim of developing EVs as a measure to cope 
with the intensified restrictions for gasoline engine vehicle's 
exhaust emissions adopted in 1970. However, this condition did 
not last long because every automaker's gasoline engines could 
meet the revised emission standard. 
  However, today, development of EVs has again become quite 
active in view of the increased challenge of protecting the 
global environment. Meanwhile, MMC has performed a series of 
research and development on EVs as shown in Table 1. This 
research was initially commenced in 1966 when they started the 
development and research of basic technologies for the vehicle 
propelling electric motor, battery, etc. which are EV's basic 
components. Beginning with the development of an 
electric-powered bus in 1973, MMC developed various EVs using 
their products such as the MINICAB, DELICA, MINICA, etc. as 
bases and produced about one hundred and twenties of EVs up to 
now. 



  In 1991 MMC and The Tokyo Electric Power Co., Ltd. succeeded 
in the joint development of an EV version Lancer which 
incorporated various electric motor-, motor control- and 
battery-related new technologies and significantly exceeded all 
conventional EVs in driving performance. 
<H5>  3. Required Performance </H5>
  The EV version Lancer was developed aiming at providing it 
with driving performance and the capability of creating a 
comfortable driving environment which had never been previously 
attained by conventional EVs while taking into consideration the 
problems experienced with the EVs which were previously used in 
metropolitan areas. 
  3.1 Driving Performance 
  To determine a driving performance that would ensure an 
inherent handling which was comparable to that of internal 
combustion engine vehicles on both general roads and the 
expressways, running speeds and accelerations/decelerations were 
measured by performing actual test runs on general roads and 
expressways in the metropolitan area (Figure 1). 



  From the measurement results, maximum speed and accelerating 
ability that the EV version Lancer was expected to have were 
determined as shown in Table 2.

------------------------------------------------------------------------------- 


  The hill-climbing ability was determined taking in 
consideration ramps from underground parking lots and steep 
uphill slopes of ordinary roads. 
  3.2 Distance Covered on a Fully Charged Battery 
  Assuming that the longest round trip distance between two 
places for commercial purposes is approximately 70 km and 
considering that power consumption somewhat increases during the 
in-city operation due to repeated acceleration and deceleration, 
the distance that needs to be covered on a fully charged battery 
was determined to be more than 200 km. 
  3.3 Equipment 
  In order to provide the new EV with good controllability for 
easy-driving and a comfortable interior environment, the vehicle 
was equipped with an electro-over-hydraulic steering system and 
electric air conditioning system, both incorporating control 
technologies for ensuring minimum power consumption. 
  Figure 2 illustrates the configuration of the main 
components 
such as the electric motor and its control unit, onboard battery 
charger, power steering system, etc. mounted in the modified 
Lancer body, while Figure 3 [photo not reproduced] shows the 
external view of the EV version Lancer. 



<H5>  4. Major Components </H5>
  The following section describes the electric motor and the 
battery both of which are the key components which govern the 
performance of the EV. 
  4.1 Electric Motor 
  Both AC and DC motors are usable as powerplants for EVs. For 
development purposes, two vehicles were produced, one being 
equipped with a DC motor and the other with an AC motor so that 
their characteristics could be compared. Table 3 shows the 
comparison between the two types of electric motors.

  4.2 Battery 
  The Ni-Cd battery was selected from among the currently 
available batteries developed for automobile use as a battery 
that can meet the distance per battery charge requirement. The 
reason for this selection was that it had high energy density, 
featured long service-life and was easy to handle. Table 4 
compares some types of batteries with respect to their 
characteristics.

<H5>  7. Future of EVs </H5>
  What are the future development and popularization 
perspectives of EVs that have lately been attracting ongoing 
attention as the most potential environment-friendly vehicles? 
  From the technical viewpoint, it is necessary to further 
improve the driving performance through development of 
technologies that permit reduction in vehicle weight, rolling 
resistance, air resistance, etc. and introduction of much 
smaller and lighter electric motors and auxiliary equipment 
having high efficiency and power conservation capabilities. It 
is also our hope to develop a regenerative control technology 
that allows the efficient recovery of the energy generated 
during braking. 
  Moreover, increasing battery performance that is the EV's 
energy source is a prerequisite for improving the performance of 
EVs. It is anticipated that the development of small-sized and 
light weight batteries capable of storing energy in high density 
will necessarily be accelerated as the development of EVs 
further advances. 
  Regarding popularization of EVs in the future, the Ministry 
of International Trade and Industry of Japan estimates that in 
the year 2000, 100,000 EVs will be produced and a total of 
200,000 EVs will be owned in Japan (Figure 4 cited from Japan 
Electric Vehicle Council's document ``Electric Vehicle Promoting 
Plan''). 



  At the same time, the Ministry of International Trade and 
Industry has a plan to establish 2,000 service stations equipped 
with battery charging facilities nationwide as an infrastructure 
to compensate for the EV's short traveling distance on a fully 
charged battery which is its weak point, thereby expanding the 
running radius of EVs. 
  The Advance Battery Consortium has also been established in 
the United States, and with the support of the government, 
active research and development are presently under way to find 
technologies that will enable the practical use of EVs. MMC will 
devote itself to producing high performance EVs.
