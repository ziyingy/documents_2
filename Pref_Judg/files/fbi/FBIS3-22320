  [Text] India and Brazil have decided to step up cooperation 
in the fields of sustainable development and environmental 
conservation. In a joint statement at Agra last evening, both 
the countries agreed to continue consultations on the working of 
the Commission on Sustainable Development and implementation of 
the framework Convention on Climate Change. The Convention on 
Biological Diversity, forestry, trade and environment, financial 
resources, and transfer of environmentally sound technology are 
the other areas in which consultations will continue. 
  The joint statement released at the end of the five-day 
discussions between the minister of environment and forests, Mr. 
Kamal Nath, and his Brazilian counterpart, Ambassador Ricupero, 
also speaks of bilateral exchange of scientists, scholars, 
technicians, and environmental management experts. Both the 
sides have also decided to cooperate in forest management, 
including plantation. The statement adds both sides shall 
jointly seek involvement of multilateral institutions to support 
bilateral projects as well as joint cooperation with other 
developing countries in the fields of environment and 
sustainable development.
