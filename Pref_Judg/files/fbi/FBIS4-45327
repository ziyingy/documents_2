Sticks To Narcotics Guidelines"] 
  [Excerpt] Duesseldorf, 2 June -- The Social Democratic 
Party of Germany [SPD] majority in the Landtag of North 
Rhine-Westphalia [NRW] has rejected the request brought forth by 
the Christian Democratic Union [CDU] and the Free Democratic 
Party of Germany [FDP] to withdraw its "narcotics guideline," 
which has caused public controversy and which requests the 
prosecuting authorities to take identical action against 
consumers of small amounts of hard and soft drugs. In a special 
session of the landtag, Justice Minister Rolf Krumsiek, and 
Health Minister Franz Muentefering, who is responsible for the 
narcotics policy, said the reasons for sticking to the 
"provisional guidelines" on the identical application of 
Paragraph 31a of the Narcotics Law in North Rhine-Westphalia was 
that the decree was "consistent with the law on all points, 
well-balanced, and well founded on substance." The opposition 
has denied that. The SPD and the Greens have accused the CDU 
and the FDP of having created insecurity among the public 
through "deliberately wrong information." The land government 
was acting in line with the law because it did not legalize 
drugs and because possession of drugs will continue to be an 
offense in North Rhine-Westphalia, the SPD and Greens said.
