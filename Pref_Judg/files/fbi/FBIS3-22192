  Sergeyev: [Video shows people working with 
various types of machinery and containers, a storage area, a 
room with control panels and computer screens] This is a 
section that turns the atomic industry's radioactive waste into 
glass. Three years ago, the Mayak Production Association in the 
South Urals increased its use of a furnace that was, and is 
unique. Russian atomic industry workers were the first to 
master, on an industrial scale, the technology for turning waste 
into a glass-like material that is then poured into these steel 
containers, made airtight, and then placed in storage cells. 
Encased in solid concrete, the nuclear genie cannot get out. 
One hundred and fifty million curies of radioactivity have been 
rendered safe so far. By way of comparison: This represents 
three Chernobyls. No one in the world has ever placed such a 
quantity of radioactive waste in storage. Colleagues from 
France, Britain, the United States, and Japan have taken an 
interest in the experience of the Mayak atomic workers. Similar 
facilities are being built there now. However, there is a 
problem. Another two or three more glass-making installations 
need to be built for all of the waste that was accumulated 
during the 40 or more years of Mayak's work for the defense 
industry to be processed quickly. But this important ecological 
program is not being fully financed, and the Urals atomic 
industry workers will not be able to deal with this problem on 
their own, without the state's help.
