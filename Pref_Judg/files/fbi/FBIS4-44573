Real-Time Signal Processor Developed''] 
  [Summary] The airborne SAR [synthetic aperture radar] 
real-time digital imaging processor developed as an 863 Program 
project by the CAS Institute of Electronics was used a few days 
ago [18 April].in an experimental flight synchronous with that 
of the [U.S.] space shuttle [``Endeavour''], winning the first 
battle and providing for Chinese technologists the first group 
of airborne SAR real-time digitally processed radar images. The 
signal processor has an operating speed of over 520 MFLOPS. 
[``Endeavour,'' flying at a 225-km altitude over North China, 
was joined by the Chinese aircraft flying at an altitude of 6000 
m. Ground crews and mission controllers together radar mapped 
50,000 square km of Chinese land--FBIS].
