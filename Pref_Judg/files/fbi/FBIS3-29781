  [Text] The National Space Development Agency of Japan 
[NASDA] will soon start remodeling the domestically-made, 
large-scale H-2 rocket, which was successfully test-launched 
recently. 
  The remodeling will aim to cut costs and reinforce the H-2's 
launch capability to assist various related projects, such as 
construction of the Japanese space shuttle "Hope" and 
exploration of the moon and other planets. Armed with funds 
totalling approximately 11 billion yen in the draft budget for 
fiscal 1994, NASDA plans to first change the design of the 
engine and airframe. 
  As the H-2 rocket is capable of launching a 2-ton-class 
satellite into geostationary orbit, projects have already been 
worked out to use it to launch meteorological satellites and 
other satellites capable of monitoring the global environment. 
NASDA has also started to develop a prototype of an unmanned 
space shuttle to be called Hope, which is scheduled to be 
launched by H-2. Without modification, however, the H-2 will be 
used in only a few, specialized areas and launch costs would be 
nearly double those of other countries. 
  NASDA will, therefore, first try to cut manufacturing costs 
and modify the design to simplify the pipe arrangements and 
welding parts of the engine and airframe. It aims, reportedly, 
to cut launch costs by 30 percent. 
  There are three different methods of reinforcing the 
rocket's 
launch capability: Increasing to six the two sets of solid fuel 
rocket boosters (SRB) which add driving force; installing two 
sets of a new type of booster which is composed of two units of 
the LE-7 main engine; and installing two sets of boosters 
composed of four units of the modified LE-7 engine, which uses 
hydrocarbon as its fuel. 
  The capability of the H-2 rocket, which is capable only of 
launching 10-ton-class satellites into a low-altitude orbit at 
present, will be increased so that it can launch satellites of 
15 tons, 17 tons, and 27 tons respectively. 
  The government's Space Activities Committee is now studying 
a 
long-term space development program. Projects connected with 
future space activities in the 21st century are under discussion 
now. Suggestions include, for example, carrying out various 
space experiments on the HOPE, and also retrieving surface soil 
from the Mars using exploration spacecraft. Teruo Sofue, a 
staff member of the comprehensive development department at 
NASDA, said: "By reinforcing the H-2 rocket, we can expand the 
range of space development. We would like to develop it into a 
rocket capable of engaging in a number of activities."
