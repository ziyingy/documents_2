  [Text] Yantai, February 14 (CNS) -- The Jiaodong 
Peninsula, a major production base for gold, boasts abundant 
resources of this precious metal, with fruitful results from 
state level scientific research on gold after four years' 
efforts passed inspection by the Ministry of Geology and Mineral 
Resources. 
  This scientific research was sponsored by the State Science 
and Technology Commission and by the ministry while the Shandong 
prospecting institute undertook the item. 
  Researchers used data processing and research methods to 
create models for the prospecting of minerals involving 
geophysics, geology and geochemistry based on earlier 
information in these fields. Different indicators were set for 
the various models. 
  Sophisticated technology was introduced into the prospecting 
of gold mines in the region. The process of forming minerals 
was projected in four areas within the 7,800 sq.-kilometre 
Jiaodong Peninsula, leading to the discovery of 26 potential 
mineral resources, five of them of great significance. 
  Experts in gold prospecting were convinced that the 
technology involved in research into gold prospecting was 
totally practical and played a leading role in such endeavours. 
Such techniques for the location of gold received awards from 
the ministry for their excellence and application in 
exploitation of gold mines which will be very promising in the 
future. 
  The gold industry has become a pillar business in some 
counties and cities in the peninsula with gold production there 
having an important share in this field in the country as a 
whole.
