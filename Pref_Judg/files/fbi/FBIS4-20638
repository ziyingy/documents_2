<H5>  I. Introduction </H5>
  The SFU (Space Flyer Unit) (Fig. 1) is the first mission 
carried out with the cooperation of three governmental bodies in 
Japan, i.e., the Science and Technology Agency, the Ministry of 
International Trade and Industry (MITI), and the Ministry of 
Education. IHI was awarded a contract from the National Space 
Development Agency of Japan (NASDA) regarding development of an 
EFFU: (Exposed Facility Flyer Unit) loaded on an SFU, and a 
contract from the Institute for Unmanned Space Experiment Free 
Flyer regarding development of both a GHF (Gradient Heating 
Furnace) and a MHF (Mirror Heating Furnace). IHI designed the 
control system for these pieces of equipment. The SFU is the 
first Japanese satellite planned for retrieval and reuse. Its 
launch by an H-2 rocket is for February 1995 with retrieval by a 
U.S. space shuttle after several months of experiments and 
observations, including those in the fields of materials, 
biology, and astronomy, in orbit some 500 km above the earth. 

<FIG ID=JPRS-JST-015L-19A>      Fig. 1 Configuration of SFU </FIG>


  This paper describes the means of satisfying the 
requirements 
of EFFU for both completing the mission and the EFFU's safety, 
two aims that seem to conflict with each other, and also 
increase the efficiency of the power amplifier for providing 
power to the GHF and MHF, high accuracy positioning of sample 
exchange unit, controlled thaw in heatpipes, etc. 
<H5>  2. EFFU and Its Control </H5>
<H5>  2.1 Outline of EFFU </H5>
  In the space station plan promoted by NASA and carried out 
by 
Japan, Europe, and Canada, Japan is to develop and operate the 
JEM (Japanese Experimental Module). IHI is in charge of total 
system coordination of the exposed facility of the JEM. EFFU is 
to carry out experiments on improving the reliability of the 
principal elemental technology of exposed equipment and also to 
support joint training for experiment skills. The following 
experiments in orbit are scheduled: 
<H5>  (1) Elemental Technology of Thermal Control by Fluid Loop </H5>
(TCS: Thermal Control System) 
  In the exposed facility of FEM, more electric power is 
consumed than by a conventional satellite. Accordingly, the heat 
accumulated is difficult to dispose of merely through conduction 
to the metallic body and radiation into space. Thermal control 
using a fluid loop is adopted in which fluid is forcibly 
circulated to absorb the heat generated. In the EFFU, a system 
is assembled to simulate the actual control loop, which consists 
of a fluid pump (400 Hz, canned motor) as the principal 
equipment and other instruments and devices fitted to piping, 
such as differential pressure sensors, temperature sensors, 
solenoid valves, heat absorbing cold plates, and radiator. The 
EFFU will be the first space unit in Japan with thermal control 
performed by a fluid loop. 
<H5>  (2) EEU (Equipment Exchange Unit) </H5>
  Payloads loaded on the exposed facility have to be exchanged 
by a manipulator in orbit. The equipment exchanging mechanism 
for the purpose is provided with actuators for working in vacuum 
and the solid-lubricated bearing of the actuator is one of the 
featured elements. 
<H5>  (3) Collecting Micro-G Characteristics Data </H5>
  One of the characteristics of space is a micro-gravity 
environment. Detection and identification of gravity 
disturbances caused by the acceleration of the flying unit (in 
EFFU, those from the operation of pump, valve, equipment 
exchange unit, etc.) are planned. 
<H5>  (4) Exposing Experiment on Requisite Materials </H5>
  Differing from a synchronous satellite, a space unit in low 
orbit is spared from the effects of cosmic rays or collisions 
with meteorites. But, currently material deterioration caused by 
atomic state oxygen in the earth's atmosphere which exists 
although thinly, is a new problem. A variety of material samples 
will be loaded and investigated after retrieval. 
<H5>  (5) Gas Dynamics Experiment </H5>
  The EFFU is one of the payloads of SFU, but this experiment 
unit can be regarded as a payload of EFFU. This was developed by 
NEC Corporation under a contract with the NASDA. 
<H5>  2.2 Control System of the EFFU </H5>
  Control of the EFFU is carried out by individual control 
unit, centering around the electrical power distribution unit 
(EPDU) which distributes power to each load and the EFFU control 
unit (ECU) which controls the whole EFFU system, besides taking 
charge of communication with the SFU. The features of each 
control are described below: 
  1. ECU (EFFU Control Unit) 
  This is installed at the center of the EFFU control systems 
and controls and monitors all controls in the EFFU (Table 1). It 
is also provided with a data interface for SFU command/telemetry 
(response and transmission of data). The ECU has a converter, 
which converts a fluctuating primary source (DC 32.5 to 51.5 V) 
into power with a stable voltage. Because communication with the 
earth on a circum-earth orbit is possible for only a few minutes 
per day, communication is limited to 875 bit/s because of the 
capacity of the data storage device. As commands from the earth 
are also limited as above, logic is provided to control 
functions that make operation fully automatic. The change of 
configuration (all of the specification) for the space unit is 
required to undergo full verification (through tests, etc.). The 
control software, therefore, are loaded as firmware. 
  2. EPDU (Electric Power Distribution Unit) 
  Not only [is] it provided with a function to deliver power 
received from SFU to each electronic equipment and heater, it is 
also equipped with fuses to protect heater power lines. The 
structures of fuses are designed with built-in redundancy in 
case of a failure. 
  3. Invertor (F-INV) 
  The invertor supplies power to a fluid pump for circulating 
coolant, inverting DC to AC 400 Hz, and is actuated by a signal 
from the ECU. 
  4. EEU Controller (MDU: Motor Drive Unit) 
  The driver of the motor of the EEU is started by a command 
from the ECU for rotation permit and direction of rotation, and 
is stopped automatically by a limit switch. The ECU monitors 
operation/failure of EEU through status signal (analog/digital). 
  5. GDEF (Gas Dynamics Experiment Facility) 
  It is provided with an intelligent electronic device which 
controls the experiment independently. The GDEF is connected to 
ECU by commands to start/stop the experiment and telemetry which 
relays experimental data to the SFU.

<FIG ID=JPRS-JST-015L-21A></FIG>


<H5>         2.2.1 Design Conditions </H5>
  The following conditions have to be met when designing 
control devices for use in space. 
<H5>  (1) Adaptation to Limited Resources </H5>
  As the launching capacity and the resources available in 
space are limited, power demand, weight, volume, the amount of 
communication necessary, and heat released have to be designed 
to meet the designed allotment for each item of equipment. In 
particular, the electric power for EFFU is critical, being an 
average of 430 W and a maximum of 700 W, so that EFFU itself 
sets the operation rule for the GDEF and the EEU, which does not 
allow both units to be operated at the same time. 
<H5>  (2) Adaptation to the Environment in Space </H5>
  (a) Vibration resistance 
  Construction must resist an environment for launching of 
rocket (sine wave 15 G[.sub]o-p[/]). 
  (b) Heat resistance 
  The large difference between the temperature when the 
satellite is in the sun and out of the sun (-30 to +60ë C) 
and the difficulty of heat disposal in vacuum (where there is no 
convection, and the heat generated in controllers has to be 
conducted from the device through circuit board, chassis, and 
structure, and is finally disposed of in space through 
radiation) should be considered. 
  (c) Resistance against radiation 
  There can be a failure of a material or functional 
deterioration caused by the accumulated total radiation dose 
from electrons or protons in space following long-term exposure, 
and failures due to bit-inversion of memory/register caused by 
attacks from high energy particles. The former can be avoided 
using rad hard parts, but some difficulties still occur due to 
restrictions on the selection of parts. As countermeasures 
against the latter, means are taken such as providing an 
automatic data correction function for the RAM, or adding a 
watchdog function or undefined address interrupting function 
(when an undefined domain is addressed, an interruption is 
caused to make the processor find and detect the error) to 
prevent microprocessors from over-running or entering an endless 
loop. 
<H5>  (3) Reliability </H5>
  As the space unit cannot be repaired during operation, high 
reliability is required for the total system, realization of 
which must be done in steps, starting from the QA of every 
constituent part, to a sub-system, and finally to the whole 
system. 
<H5>  (4) Safety </H5>
  During retrieval by space shuttle, NASA's safety 
requirements 
have to be met (triple safety guards, in which even if two 
guards fail, the remaining one works). 
  To confirm fulfillment of these requirements, environmental 
tests are being carried out (vibration, shock, acoustic noise, 
heating in vacuum, electro-magnetic compatibility), and even in 
designing stage evaluation committees according to each design 
phase, are meeting to assess the appropriateness of the design 
work. 
<H5>  2.3 Features of EFFU Controlling System </H5>
<H5>  2.3.1 Problems of the System </H5>
  When the control system is structured, interlock functions 
must be provided from the viewpoint of safety, which shut down 
the system safely to prevent possible damage whenever an 
abnormality is found by the signal indicating temperature, 
pressure, voltage, current, etc., of the measuring system. These 
interlock functions, however, may cause a total system shutdown 
when only one failure is indicated by a sensor signal. 
<H5>  2.3.2 Consideration To Be Given in the Design Stage </H5>
  To improve reliability and prevent the system from shutting 
down due to just one failure, the following considerations are 
given in the design: 
  1. Redundant design 
  2. Fail-safe design 
  3. Derating design (safety margin design) 
  4. Use of reliable parts 
<H5>  2.3.3 Design of the EFFU Control System </H5>
  In the case of the EFFU system, a fail-safe and dilating 
design and use of reliable parts could be adopted, but a 
redundant design could be adopted for both sensor system and 
facility because of weight and volume restrictions. To fulfill 
the mission but still ensure safety, the interlock release 
function described below is provided. That is, when the ECU 
notices an extraordinary phenomenon, the system is shut down 
first to assure safety. The ECU immediately sends an error 
flag/error code to the earth, which gives details of the 
failure, allowing identification of the failure on the earth. 
<H5>  2.3.4 Items for Interlock Cancellation </H5>
  As cancellation of interlock in nature conflicts with the 
requirements of safety, identification and selection of 
interlock cancellation items (Table 2) required very serious 
consideration. All of these items are commonly used for control 
and inspection, and are limited to those in which a failure of 
the sensor concerned can be identified by data from other 
sensors. 



  -------------------------------------------------------------------------------

------------------------------------------------------------------------------- 


<H5>  2.3.5 Operation of Interlock Release </H5>
  As shown in Fig. 5, when the error codes from the EFFU 
through the SFU are received by the earth station, the engineers 
at the station start data analyses to identify the cause of the 
failure using monitoring equipment on the earth. And when it is 
assured that the cause is a sensor failure and safety is not 
affected, release of the interlocking device is requested to the 
land control station to restart experiments. The command sent by 
land control station is delivered to the EFFU through the SFU to 
re-start the experiment. 

<FIG ID=JPRS-JST-015L-22A>      Fig. 5 Operation for Cancellation of Interlock </FIG>


  Release of interlocking devices is designed to be determined 
by failure analyses conducted on the earth station because of 
the long operation period of the SFU. The experiments in orbit 
are carried out under a time-sharing program between the three 
participating governmental bodies, which gives sufficient time 
for identifying a failure in the EFFU and a decision 
countermeasure while experiments other than those of the EFFU 
are being carried out. 
<H5>  2.3.6 Tasks for Future Operations </H5>
  An operation manual needs to be prepared that identifies the 
nature of a sensor failure by other sensors. This manual is for 
identifying a sensor failure sensor quickly and accurately 
during operation, using means such as flow charts with clear 
threshold values, which are based on environmental and 
functional experiment data obtained from the engineer model (EM) 
and the proto-flight model (PFM). 
<H5>  3. GHF/MHF and Their Control </H5>
<H5>  3.1 Outline of GHF and MHF </H5>
  GHF is a semiconductor manufacturing equipment (electric 
furnace), in which crystals are grown by moving the boundary 
surface of a solid/liquid state of a sample sealed in a 
cartridge at a determined speed, while giving temperature 
gradient to the sample. Eleven cartridges are provided, which 
can be continuously heat-treated by a sample exchange equipment. 
  MHF is similar furnace in which crystal growth is achieved 
by 
focusing a heating beam from a halogen lamp on a sample in a 
cartridge to form a melted surface, moving the furnace at a 
determined speed. Seven sample cartridges are provided. MHF is 
provided with a function to prevent irregular heating by 
rotating the sample due to the disadvantage of having only a 
one-point heating source. 
  Both the GHF and the MHF consist of control system, furnace, 
and sample exchanger. Figure 6 is the system diagram of GHF. 
Figure 7 is an illustration of the completed MHF. The GHF and 
the MHF are respectively mounted on a box-like structure called 
the PLU (Payload Unit) supplied by clients and are loaded on the 
SFU. The GHF on the PLU is illustrated in Figure 8. 

<FIG ID=JPRS-JST-015L-23A>      Fig. 6 Functional Diagram of GHF </FIG>


<FIG ID=JPRS-JST-015L-23B>      Fig. 7 MHF </FIG>



<FIG ID=JPRS-JST-015L-23C>      Fig. 8 GHF With PLU </FIG>



<H5>  3.2 Control of GHF and MHF </H5>
  Control of GHF and MHF is carried out by respective control 
equipment (GHF-CE, MHF-CE). The functions and features of each 
control equipment are as follows. 
<H5>  3.2.1 Communication Interface Between SFU Bus </H5>
  Like EFFU, the communication interface includes the 
following 
four. 
  Discrete on/off signal (start/stop) 
  Fault interface (shut-off request on fault) 
  Command (two-way communication with bus) 
  Telemetry (data communication to bus) 
<H5>  3.2.2 Temperature Control of GHF </H5>
  A thermocouple is provided for each of the three heaters of 
the GHF for control. The GHF-CE controls these heaters 
independently, aiming to form the same temperature profile as 
that previously determined in the land experiment. 
  To meet the safety requirements of NASA (assuring safety 
even 
under double failures), three mutually independent temperature 
limiters are provided against overheating of the heaters to shut 
off the power supply to the GHF at the pre-set limiting 
temperature. One of the limiters is a software limiter operated 
by a CPU, while the other two consist only of hardware. For the 
latter hardware limiters not operated through CPU, consideration 
is given to assure they work properly even when the software 
limiter fails, as in a CPU runaway caused by cosmic rays. 
  These three limiters are of the type in which thermal 
measurement errors in the thermocouple caused by the 
environmental temperature fluctuation are automatically 
compensated. 
<H5>  3.2.3 Power Control in MHF </H5>
  In the MHF, the power input to one heating lamp is 
IPD-controlled to achieve a power profile that is the same as 
that predetermined by land experiments. 
  Like the GHF, the MHF is also provided with three 
independent 
over-heat limiters. In the case of MHF, however, the structure 
of the furnace does not allow the furnace temperature to be 
directly measured for preventing the overheating of the heating 
lamp. Therefore, unlike the GHF which is provided with 
temperature limiters a method is adopted whereby overheating of 
the furnace heating lamp is detected by the voltage of the power 
input. That is, noticing that the electric resistance of the 
lamp filament varies in proportion to its temperature, the 
method utilizes the fact that even when constant power is 
supplied to the lamp, if the furnace becomes overheated the 
supply voltage increases above normal and overheating is 
detected by this excessive voltage. 
<H5>  3.2.4 High-Efficiency Power Amplifier </H5>
  Control device of GHF-CE and MHF-CE have to meet designing 
conditions capable to deal with: 
  [1] Severe restrictions from resources such as power, 
weight, 
and dimensions. 
  [2] The restriction of heat disposal is severe. In addition, 
for the power amplifier, the principal component of the control 
system, there are the following difficult design conditions. 
  [3] The heater lamp of the furnace being a load, is short 
and 
fat to give the required vibration resistance, this making the 
electric resistance of the lamp as low as some 1 ohm, thus 
causing more power loss. 
  [4] The electromagnetic compatibility (EMC) with the 
satellite system requires the amount of noise affecting the 
powerline to be limited and the necessity of performing 
restriction of inrush current of start-up. 
  Accordingly, the power amplifier must be highly efficient 
even at a low resistance load, and still be small and light 
after meeting the EMC requirement. Under these restrictions, a 
push-pull type of high efficiency power amplifier with a 70 kHz 
switching frequency was developed (Table 3). To realize high 
efficiency, the following design features were incorporated: 
  [1] Optimization of snubber for balancing the loss and noise 
(if the snubber is strengthened noise is reduced, however the 
loss increases making efficiency low). 
  [2] Optimization of switching frequency (with increased 
frequency, the weight and dimensions of transformer/inductor 
will be cut but efficiency will decrease). 
  [3] By connecting in parallel the switching FET and the 
primary input capacitor, the loss power was cut by decreasing 
its register element. 
  [4] Applying high density outfit technique. 
  These design parameters were determined for their optimum 
values by rotating the cycle of analyzing/experimenting in the 
development steps consisting of elemental prototype, engineering 
model, and proto-flight model. In particular, for assessing the 
heat disposal of high heat generating elements, temperature 
distribution measurement by a thermo-viewer and a heat test are 
conducted to ensure the high density outfit design is adequate. 

<FIG ID=JPRS-JST-015L-24A>      Table 3. Specification of Power Amplifier </FIG>


<H5>  3.2.5 Function of Sample Exchange Control </H5>
  The sample exchange equipment is required to position with 
high accuracy the sample within an eccentricity of less than +/- 
0.1mm between the center of the furnace and that of the sample. 
Especially for the MHF, if the focus of the heating ray is 
off-center from the fusing point of cartridge, the impact on the 
experiment is great, because the required heating temperature 
might not be reached. Due to the above reasons, the accuracy of 
turning angle control for the sample cartridge positioning motor 
is required to be within less than +/- 0.08 degrees. 
  To realize such high accuracy, a non-contact type high 
accuracy position sensor is adopted and, by combining a rough 
accuracy sensor and fine accuracy sensors together, a sensing 
accuracy of about +/- 0.0083 degree (0.5 minutes) can be 
obtained. 
  A low vibration motor was developed to create a microgravity 
atmosphere. The order of the gravity generated by the motor is 
10[.sup]-6[/]G. 
<H5>  3.2.6 Control of Thaw in Heat Pipe </H5>
  The heat pipe developed for heat disposal in furnaces uses 
water as a cooling fluid. If SFU started operation at a 
temperature below zero, a case often expected in the operation 
of the SFU, the fluid might [be] frozen. If the fluid is frozen, 
the furnace might overheat due to poor heat disposal because of 
deterioration of heat transfer. Furthermore, only the fluid near 
the furnace is thawed, and the evaporated fluid causing very 
high pressures in the heat pipe, might break the heat pipe, 
which is a serious safety problem. 
  Therefore, controlling thaw of the heat pipe is 
automatically 
started upon commencement of furnace operations. This control is 
carried out by judging freeze or thaw from the temperature 
rising pattern measured by temperature sensors provided on the 
heat pipes. When operation of furnace is started, a small power 
supply of some 50W is provided first to the furnace. With frozen 
liquid, the temperature of the heatpipe shows a rise once and 
then decreases as shown in Fig. 9a. The point where decreasing 
begins is judged to be the thawing point. On the other hand, 
when it is already thawed and the power continues to be supplied 
if the temperature does not rise above a certain temperature as 
shown in Fig. 9b, it is judged to be the thawing point. The 
relation between time and temperature for the judgment was 
determined by data in land testing. With this control, the 
thawing of the heat pipe can be reliably carried out, regardless 
of the state of the fluid. 

<FIG ID=JPRS-JST-015L-25A>      Fig. 9 Temperature Rise Pattern of Heat Pipe </FIG>


  For safety, even if this control does not work due to 
possible CPU runaway, a rupture of the heat pipe caused by its 
overheating can be avoided with two independent thermostats

<H5>  3.2.7 Parameter-Changing Function </H5>
  For the control parameters of furnaces (e.g., target 
temperature, heating time, furnace traveling speed), data proved 
in land tests and installed in the PROM of the CE are used. 
However, the equipment has to wait about two years before its 
flight, during which period it is assembled as a satellite, and 
undergoes various system test procedures. Therefore, functions 
are provided to change the control parameters with commands from 
the earth, because [1] many changes might be required for 
parameters installed in the PROM as the result of land 
experiments thereafter, and [2] to facilitate operation of the 
field experiment staff. 
  The above function was not necessarily required for the 
existing experiment system of small rockets because its 
operating time is only a few minutes. While for experiments in 
the space shuttle, a scientist in the crew can operate the 
equipment. 
  The function of changing parameters is executed under the 
procedure below: 
  [1] The control parameters must be checked previously on the 
earth to confirm that the change causes no problem from land 
experiment or other means. 
  [2] The parameter values for experiment desired to be 
changed 
are made to be recorded in the change data memory on RAM of CE's 
of GHF and MHF by the command from the earth. 
  [3] When this experiment is to be executed, the program 
checks automatically whether there are data recorded in the 
change data memory, and if such data exists, the experiment is 
carried out with the new data replacing the old parameter values. 
<H5>  4. Conclusion </H5>
  Production of the PFM for each item of equipment are 
completed, and the SFU system tests are now being carried out. 
Following these tests, the equipment will be delivered after 
some minor work, such as replacement of consumable spare parts. 
We will exert our best efforts to make the equipment work 
properly in the actual flight to bring about successful 
experiments. 
  It should be noted that the development of both the GHF and 
the MHF have been carried out under a contract given to IHI by 
the New Energy and Industry Technology Development Organization 
(NEDO).
