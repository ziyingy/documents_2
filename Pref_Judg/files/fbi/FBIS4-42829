  [Text] Brussels, June 8 (AFP) -- The European Union's [EU] 
executive Commission Wednesday [8 June] urged the 12 member 
states to adopt a concerted strategy to fight drug trafficking 
and drug addiction. 
  The EU commissioner in charge of justice and internal 
affairs, Padraig Flynn, said "drug addiction and trafficking 
present a major threat for Europe's citizens." He said the 
problems called for a "coordinated reaction by the Union and its 
member states." 
  The action plan presented by Flynn suggests better use could 
be made of the Netherlands-based Europol to achieve police, 
customs and legal cooperation to fight drug trafficking. 
  The plan also suggests greater cooperation with third 
countries either in the framework of existing international 
agreements or by negotiating specific agreements.
