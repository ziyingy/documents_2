  [Text] Taipei, May 5 (CNA) -- Three United States 
congressmen, concerned about Beijing's handling of the March 31 
murder and robbery of 24 Taiwan tourists, will meet with the 
victims' relatives to better understand the tragic incident, the 
Chinese association for human rights said Wednesday. 
  Rep. Tom Lantos (D-Calif.), Rep. Dick Sweat (D-N.H.), and 
Rep. Nancy Pelosi (D-Calif.) are expected to hold a 
Taipei-Washington, D.C., teleconference with the victims' 
relatives, an association spokesman said. 
  All three congressmen have previously expressed their 
concern 
about human rights conditions in Mainland China and are expected 
to ask the Taiwan relatives if Beijing's handling of the murders 
violated any human rights standards. 
  The spokesman said that the conference will probably take 
place on Saturday, one day before a Taiwan delegation is 
scheduled to leave for Mainland China for a two-week visit to 
find out more about the crime. 
  The spokesman said that the congressmen would ask questions 
about whether the relatives were under house arrests when they 
went to Zhejiang to identify the charred bodies, the facts about 
mainland authorities prohibiting newsmen from approaching the 
boat, and about the mainland performing autopsies before the 
arrival of the relatives.
