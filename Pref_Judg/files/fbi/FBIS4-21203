  [Excerpt] Interior Minister Carlos Podesta on 9 April 
announced that the government is going to investigate the local 
connection with an international network that deals in narcotics 
and arms trafficking and money laundering. He confirmed that 
``numbers game kingpin'' Miro Garcia had been seen several times 
in the casino in Ciudad del Este that belongs to Carlos Barreto 
Sarubbi. Podesta confirmed that Garcia is linked to ``the world 
of illegal gambling'' in the neighboring country. 
  ``They are things that have to be investigated, because one 
never knows whether it is simply media speculation or whether it 
goes beyond that, and in this case the government is going to 
investigate,'' the minister said, when asked about a published 
report regarding the discovery of an international network 
dealing in smuggling, narcotics and arms trafficking, and money 
laundering with connections in Ciudad del Este. ``This Garcia 
is known in the world of illegal gambling in Brazil,'' the 
minister confirmed. In the investigations Garcia appears to be 
seriously involved in being pinpointed as the ``numbers game 
kingpin.'' As is known, the ``animal lottery'' (a game) is 
banned in Brazil; it is similar to the numbers game played in 
our country, with the difference that the cards have pictures of 
animals instead of numbers. According to the Brazilian police, 
this game was implemented by the mafia, and it seems that it is 
a cover for other illegal activities such as the laundering of 
dollars, smuggling, and narcotics and weapons trafficking, among 
other things. 
  Podesta stated that he had information that Garcia is 
apparently involved in arms or drug trafficking. ``This is why 
I am waiting for my men (investigators) to tell me how they plan 
to coordinate and begin actions to clarify this charge,'' he 
promised. [passage omitted]
