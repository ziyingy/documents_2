  [Text] Seoul, Feb. 12 (YONHAP) -- South Korea, Japan and 
Russia will conduct a joint test of the East Sea from next month 
for signs of contamination from radioactive waste dumped by 
Moscow, the Foreign Ministry announced Saturday. The three 
countries signed an agreement in Vladivostok to send out the 
4,000-ton Okean, a Russian survey vessel, to seven test points 
in the sea that lies between Korea and Japan. Okean will leave 
Vladivostok around March 10 and stay out for 31 days, the 
Ministry said. 
  A total of 32 surveyers, seven from South Korea, nine from 
Japan, 15 from Russia and one from the International Atomic 
Energy Agency (IAEA), will participate in sampling of the water, 
seabed and plankton. 
  Seoul and Tokyo were alerted and ired when they found out 
last fall that the former Soviet Union and Russia have been 
dumping nuclear waste into their adjacent seas for decades. 
  Plans for a joint survey were delayed over cost sharing, but 
the three countries finally agreed to bear the burden equally, 
the Ministry said. 
  On-spot test results would be out within one month after 
Okean completes its course, but the final analysis will be out 
approximately a year later. 
  Second set of survey will take place sometime in mid-year, 
the Ministry said.
