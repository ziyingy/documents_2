1989 U.S. invasion of Panama; narrated by unidentified 
announcer; released to the public by Panamanian President 
Guillermo Endara following a recorded message to the nation in 
Panama City on 14 April] 
  [Text] [Announcer] The military and civilian dictatorship's 
regime turned the Electoral Tribunal [TE] into a machine to 
thwart the people's decision and to carry out political 
persecution. Elections were only bogus processes to maintain an 
international image. [video shows former National Bank Manager 
Jaime Simmons addressing a meeting] 
  [Simmons, identified by caption] Therefore, I want to 
present 
a serious proposal here, Mr. President -- that we coordinate the 
100,000-odd officials we have on the payroll, with the presence 
of the distinguished TE President Yolanda Pulice de Rodriguez. 
We can also make an adjustment; and we can also weed it out. I 
specifically propose that we send the TE all of the details to 
learn who is most adept and what is the political background of 
all of those who comprise the state's workforce. [video cuts to 
show Pulice de Rodriguez addressing meeting] 
  [Pulice de Rodriguez, identified by caption, in progress] 
...because when I hear Mr. Simmons say the TE will supply him 
with a list in order that he may detect whether his government 
officials are or are not registered in a political party, I say 
it is also worthwhile to state here how the TE fulfills this 
request from a state entity that requires the institution's 
service. It is true we render that service. 
  [Announcer] The TE did not want the public to learn this, 
and 
the president of that organization requested confidentiality 
because this would cause its deteriorated image to sink to even 
greater depths. [video cuts to Pulice de Rodriguez at the same 
meeting] 
  [Pulice de Rodriguez, in progress] ...because it has been 
reported that the TE is behind all of these public employees' 
dismissals, simply because they registered, or have failed to 
register, in a political party. That is not advantageous for 
the TE, much less under the current circumstances. Our 
activity, aside from being juridical and electoral, is 
political. [video cuts to show Former President Manuel Solis 
Palma speaking at a podium] 
  [Manuel Solis Palma, broadcast in progress] ...because I 
will 
leave here to address the closing session of an electoral 
seminar, and I will speak well of the elections there. I cannot 
leave here and say there will be no elections and then go over 
there and speak well of the elections. I cannot continue to 
talk about the advantages of the elections while strategically 
planning to abolish them. 
  [Announcer] The military and civilian dictatorship's regime 
became so thoroughly corrupt that it left us a country in ruins 
and morally destroyed. [video cuts to unidentified labor leader 
seated and addressing a group of people] 
  [Labor leader] In our case, we talk about cement. We can 
supply enough information to prove that legislators, meaning the 
unproductive Legislative Assembly we have been mentioning for 
months, use this mechanism as an additional source of income. 
They accept donations and sell these to stores and clients who 
usually purchase from us in cash. This directly affects the 
state's revenues. [video cuts to Labor Party leader Ramon 
Sieiro Murgas addressing a group of people] 
  [Sieiro Murgas, identified by caption] I ask: If the UNADE 
[National Democratic Union] government accepts at this point -- 
10 months from the elections -- the existence of sinecures, will 
this help us or work against our own interests? I will not 
break down the meaning of sinecure, or cushy job, or phantom job 
at this point in time. [video cuts to show former Legislator 
Luis Gomez addressing a meeting] 
  [Gomez, identified by caption, broadcast in progress] ...he 
revealed legislators have 3,200 sinecures. Let us adopt a 
decision in connection with this, Mr. President. We will demand 
something: Let us discuss the government's final decision on 
this. Either we eliminate all the sinecures -- all of them, 
every one of them, not only the mistresses, if they exist; not 
only the ministers' friends, if they exist; or the legislators' 
mistresses and friends; and, why not say it, with due respect to 
our Defense Forces comrades, the Defense Forces' friends. What 
will be the political decision? When will we adopt the 
political decision to abolish the sinecures? Now! [video cuts 
to show Minena de Duran addressing the same meeting] 
  [Minena de Duran, identified by caption] We can negotiate 
with all of the parties and all of the legislators for a 
reduction of salaries among the sinecures. This way, no one's 
feelings will be hurt. Mr. President, I suggest an evaluation 
commission study all of the cases of sinecures, cushy jobs, and 
phantom jobs -- as our friend here says. Simply put, there 
should be an agreement, Mr. President, because we have 
unfortunately learned it is true there are cushy jobs with a 
salary of $2,000-$3,000. [video cuts to show Solis Palma 
seated, addressing a crowd] 
  [Solis Palma, in progress] ...we will win the elections with 
this. They are quite sure about this, meaning we will win the 
elections with 800 sinecures in each ministry. We will win 
nothing! There are no secrets in this country -- much less at a 
lower level. Everyone knows, meaning every employee knows, that 
they are compelled to make sacrifices while others earn $2,000 
or $3,000 in a sinecure and only show up on payday to collect 
their check. [video cuts to show second unidentified labor 
leader addressing a crowd] 
  [Labor leader] We see corruption is rampant. We see 
corruption continues to spread; and we have protested; and we 
have said this since 1984 -- yet there is no way we can stop 
those things. Leaders who figure prominently for different 
reasons are subject to a persecution while crooks and thieves 
receive awards. [video cuts to show Solis Palma, seated at a 
cabinet meeting] 
  [Solis Palma] People are being told that public employees 
are openly selling diesel, gasoline, tires, spares parts for 
tractors, and so on -- all at very reasonable price. The Public 
Works Ministry employees are constantly going around selling 
diesel, gasoline, oil, tires, spare parts... [audio interrupted 
in mid-sentence] 
  [Announcer] The current administration found the state's 
finances completely depleted, the National Savings Banks and the 
National Bank of Panama [BNP] completely ruined, and the Social 
Security Fund [CSS] virtually looted. [video cuts to show Solis 
Palma speaking at a luncheon] 
  [Solis Palma] When we are told to instruct the National 
Banking Commission to release funding, or told to do this or 
that, we cannot tell them to do this, because the moment they 
release funds, the BNP will collapse. The BNP cannot even 
release 10 percent of its savings accounts and time deposits, 
and the National Savings Bank cannot even release 5 percent of 
its savings accounts. They simply cannot do it. They simply do 
not have sufficient financial resources; then we have to 
continue prolonging... [pauses] because there are banks that do 
have sufficient resources. 
  If we do decide to go through with this, we will be opening 
the door to putting the BNP and the National Savings Bank in a 
very difficult situation. We could order them not to pay, in 
light of the fact that government institutions are not forced to 
pay. But what do you think this will do to the National Savings 
Bank and the BNP's image in the banking community? They will be 
the only two banking institutions who will not be able to pay. 
No one would ever again trust depositing money in the BNP or 
the National Savings Bank. [video cuts to show former BNP 
General Manager Rafael Arosemena addressing a group of people in 
an auditorium] 
  [Arosemena, identified by caption] Considering that this 
session is being recorded, I would like to recommend that any 
reference to the BNP at a given moment should be removed from 
the film, because we are talking about financial soundness, 
liquidity.... [video cuts in mid-sentence to show Ovido Diaz, 
former Revolutionary Democratic Party (PRD) vice president, 
addressing a group at a banquet hall] 
  [Diaz, identified by caption] We are aware that during the 
month of December the budget deficit totaled 800 million 
balboas; furthermore, it has probably increased during these 
past months, and at any moment we will have to confront this 
issue. [video cuts to show Solis Palma, speaking at conference 
table] 
  [Solis Palma] The National Savings Bank also has some areas 
that cannot continue operating. It is not a matter that the 
National Savings Bank has not produced sufficient revenues, it 
is just that the revenues are earmarked specifically to cover 
payrolls. [video cuts to show Rafael Rodriguez, former 
comptroller general and former provisional president of the 
Republic, sitting in a conference room] 
  [Rafael Rodriguez] Unfortunately, we have limited ourselves 
to paying for an oversized bureaucracy instead of attempting to 
do something about it. 
  [Announcer] During the military and civilian dictatorship, 
the candidates were always chosen at military headquarters. The 
best example is the 1984 meeting that took place at the 
Tinajitas Military Barracks. [video cuts to show Ernesto Perez 
Balladares, former minister of planning and PRD member, speaking 
to a group of reporters] 
  [Balladares] I took part in the Tinajitas meeting. 
Unfortunately, I do not have copy of my comments because they 
were unrehearsed. [video cuts to show Nander Pitty Velasquez, 
former comptroller general and presidency minister, addressing a 
cabinet meeting] 
  [Pitty, identified by caption] One of the things we have 
always criticized about the Fortuna hydroelectric dam project, 
and I have always been one of its most severe critics, because 
it is not just now that I am saying this. [sentence as heard] 
As presidential adviser, I continuously complained in writing 
about the continuous modifications the IRHE [Institute of 
Hydraulic Resources and Electrification] began to issue after 
the bid had been tendered. 
  In this respect, a bid was awarded for the construction of a 
project, and later on, modifications were made to the contract 
based on what the IRHE described as changes. These 
modifications began to pile up, and when they had a whole pile 
of them, they would bring them to the cabinet meeting to be 
discussed. The ministers at the time could do nothing but 
approve the modifications because the funds had already been 
spent, and the project had been completed. If the funds had not 
been spent, the project had been completed, and then there was 
the need to pay. [sentence as heard] I do not remember how much 
the project ended up costing. Maybe IRHE Chief Engineer Herrera 
could refresh my memory on how much the original bid amounted to. 
  [Herrera, off camera] Yes, Mr. President, Mr. Minister. The 
initial cost of the project was $252 million, and it ended up 
costing $514 million, all costs and benefits included. 
  [Pitty] Thank you very much. 
  [Herrera] I would like to add that $80 million should be 
attributed to inflation and interest. 
  [Pitty] Right. Now, Mr. President, what could take place in 
the second phase of the Fortuna project is something similar to 
what I have already stated. [video cuts to show Solis Palma, 
seated at the same cabinet meeting] 
  [Solis Palma] What we have here is a rush and a real concern 
to prevent the second phase of the Fortuna project from being 
completed. However, it is being said that it should have been 
completed four years ago, and that nearly $2 million are lost 
every month because the project has not been completed. In this 
respect, we are now speaking of $96 million that has been lost 
over the past four years. In spite of this, the two ministers 
responsible for this project have never said anything about the 
issue. 
  [Announcer] The military and civilian dictatorship would 
normally divide the government just like a cake. [video cuts to 
show former provisional President Francisco Rodriguez, 
addressing a cabinet meeting] 
  [Rodriguez] There is enough for all of us. This cake is so 
big that everyone... [video cuts in mid-sentence to show Romulo 
Escobar Bethancourt, former president of the PRD National 
Executive Committee, seated in a conference room] 
  [Escobar, identified by caption] Then it should be the party 
that recommends the person or persons to occupy the positions. 
All of the parties that [word indistinct] must be integrated in 
the high-ranking positions. [video cuts to show Pulice de 
Rodriguez seated in a conference room, addressing a crowd] 
  [Pulice de Rodriguez] We must all support our president. 
[video cuts to show former General Manuel Antonio Noriega, 
standing, addressing a group of legislators in an auditorium] 
  [Noriega] We all came to power united, and we must unite to 
accomplish a purpose. From this position, which is built on the 
power of the people, no one will remove us. In addition, we 
will never allow any of our officials to be substituted, 
replaced, or driven out. We cannot allow ourselves the luxury 
to cry tomorrow for those things we were unable to defend today. 
[video cuts to show Ovidio Diaz addressing a group of people] 
  [Diaz] The least a government in power should do is to do 
all 
it can to remain in office. That is something we heard Gen. 
Torrijos say, and I share his views. [video cuts to show Nander 
Pitty speaking at a cabinet meeting] 
  [Pitty] Our unforgettable Omar Torrijos used to say that the 
duty of every government is to make sure it is not overthrown. 
The first duty of every ruler is to make sure he is not 
overthrown, and this is what we must do. 
  [Announcer] The civilian and military dictatorship raised 
manipulation and deceit to unbelievable levels. Workers and 
government workers were told one thing, while another was being 
planned behind their backs. The people were told of a 
nationalist struggle, but in actuality this was only an 
instrument to hide the real purpose. [video shows Tomas Gabriel 
Altamirano Duque addressing a crowd] 
  [Altamirano Duque, identified by caption] Unfortunately, if 
there is no money, you cannot take part in politics. And there 
is no money. All we have left is to exploit nationalism as much 
as we can, because this is another way of getting into politics 
-- not only against the United States, but against all those who 
are trying to finish off this government. When money is not 
used, then nationalism must be used. I believe we are doing 
pretty well. [video cuts to show Daniel Delgado, lieutenant 
colonel in the former Panamanian Defense Forces, speaking at a 
podium] 
  [Delgado, identified by caption] From the foreign point of 
view, this problem is seen as a demagogic problem. To put it 
simply, Panama is trying to overcome the real problems of lack 
of democracy, lack of human rights, drug trafficking, and 
corruption. That is the problem. 
  [Announcer] Labor leaders were also manipulated. [video cuts 
to show Solis Palma, seated between two unidentified men, 
addressing a group] 
  [Solis Palma] We have a man like Mauro Murillo [general 
secretary of the National Organization of Panamanian Workers], 
who is a man of great quality, and who handles matters with 
great ability, but who cannot overstep himself because we will 
burn him. We will destroy him, and this would be very dangerous. 
It would be dangerous to destroy our leaders who manipulate 
problems for us. We cannot burn Hector Aleman [secretary 
general of the National Federation of Associations of Public 
Employees]. He is trying to navigate in very choppy waters. 
What we must do is provide him with a good boat that will not 
sink. 
  We cannot allow the National Port Authorities to pay out 
$341,000 in 13th month bonuses during the first two weeks of the 
month. How can we do that? There is no ceiling on payments. 
In addition, in December we would have to pay them $867,000, 
because they have additional Christmas bonuses. The National 
Casino workers must be paid $188,000 right now and in December 
we must pay them $548,000. But the worst one is the IRHE. Right 
now we must give them $1.355 million. For them, there is no 
ceiling. And in December we must give them $4.088 million. 
  [Unidentified speaker, off camera] As well as free 
electricity. 
  [Solis Palma] Plus electricity, twilight [media luz], and 
all 
of that. 
  INTEL [National Institute of Telecommunications] would 
receive $759,000 with no ceiling. With a ceiling, it would be 
much lower. In December they would receive $2.173 million. Then 
we have the National Beneficent Lottery. That did not come from 
the Canal Zone. That was established by Fito [Tomas Gabriel 
Altamirano Duque] before he was born. [laughter] 
  [Unidentified speaker] Do not look away. [laughter] 
  [Solis Palma] The National Beneficent Lottery came even 
before that. He was not even involved in the planning stages. 
[laughter] The lottery receives $259,000. I do not know if the 
lottery has a ceiling or not. The next bonus is in the amount 
of $792,000. There is a difference of $5 million in 13th month 
bonuses among those institutions. All of this must be 
confronted sooner or later, because we cannot continue with 
those privileges, with those great disparities we are 
experiencing. It is time we begin looking to the future. The 
biggest mistake we made, and we were forced to make it, was to 
make the first payment of the 13th month bonus. [video cuts to 
show Sieiro Murgas seated and addressing a group] 
  [Sieiro Murgas] It is true that I have said that in 1983 
there was talk of reducing the government payroll. This was to 
pay off the foreign debt. Fine, now we have adopted some 
measures. [video cuts to show PRD legislator Mario Rognoni 
addressing a group] 
  [Rognoni] In that first phase, there is something that is 
even more delicate. It comprises the enemies of the state -- 
the seditious ones who remain inside the institutions. 
Nevertheless, this is a bit more difficult to do than what 
Simmons has proposed. What we must first do is pinpoint them, 
open a file on them, and, based on this, have them removed 
according to the guidelines of each institution. 
  I suggest that in the first phase of this plan we divide the 
government into three areas: those that have to reduce their 
payroll by 8 percent, those that have to reduce their payroll by 
12 percent, and those that have to reduce their payroll by 16 
percent. [video cuts to show former PRD legislator Rigoberto 
Paredes addressing a crowd] 
  [Paredes, identified by caption] The politicians, those who 
should know how to handle this politically and properly, kept 
thinking of protection, of friends, and of the support of this 
or that colonel. They stepped back to let us know that we had 
to learn to live like men and women who can handle themselves 
and run this as it should be run. 
  [Announcer] The state ministers themselves rendered reports 
to the Defense Forces of the Republic of Panama [FDP] rather 
than to the president himself. [video cuts to show Solis Palma 
being interviewed by an unidentified reporter] 
  [Reporter] Are you talking about today? 
  [Solis Palma] Yes, the ambassadors many times call on the 
commander. They do not call on the president to give their 
reports, because it had been like that... 
  [Reporter, interrupting] It has been the established rule... 
  [Solis Palma, interrupting] It has been the rule during the 
past 20 years, or 18 years. It is the FDP itself that gives the 
instructions to call the Presidency. [video cuts to show 
Targidio Bernal, former deputy government and justice minister, 
speaking at a meeting] 
  [Bernal, identified by caption] We have gotten used to not 
acting -- not acting as civilians, and not acting as a civilian 
government, thereby leaving the responsibility to the FDP. We 
have not understood two things: The more the FDP acts, the more 
its image, its prestige, and so on wastes away. The other thing 
is that they could tire of us, because what we did yesterday, by 
the way, was a blitzkrieg. I think that in six hours we changed 
two presidents with one crushing blow to the balls [un solo 
huevazo] [words indistinct]. This has never occurred in our 
nation's history. [video cuts to show Jose Young, not further 
identified, addressing a crowd] 
  [Young, identified by caption] There is general discontent 
in 
the public workers sector because of the reduction in salaries, 
particularly among teachers and professors. [video cuts to show 
closeup of Solis Palma] 
  [Solis Palma] General Noriega is a drug trafficker. He is a 
man that should be ousted from the country, he is a dictator, 
and he is opposed to democracy. [video cuts to another closeup 
of Solis Palma] 
  Air Panama employees have accepted that a large number of 
their personnel must be dismissed, because even if we operate 
with two airplanes, we have to fire people, and even if we 
operate with three airplanes, we have to fire people. The 
Social Security Fund must continue employing 14,000-15,000 
workers. The casinos must continue with the number of workers 
on their payroll. The Digedecom [General Directorate for 
Community Development] has to continue with the number of 
workers it has. Commander Gen. Manuel Antonio Noriega, Latin 
American leader and idol of Panama -- the general commands and 
the president obeys. [video cuts to show Solis Palma 
addressing large political rally] 
  In Japan, to talk about Alfonsin [former president of 
Argentina] -- well, very few Japanese know who Alfonsin is. 
Nevertheless, I do not believe there is one Japanese citizen who 
does not know who Manuel Antonio Noriega is. [applause] 
Certainly, we all know who he is. [video cuts to show Francisco 
Rodriguez speaking to a group of people] 
  [Rodriguez] Public servants are appointed to institutions 
where they do not work. Some work in other places, while others 
do not work anywhere. [video cuts to show Solis Palma addressing 
a meeting] 
  [Solis Palma] All of those who carry PRD cards are 
interested 
in being promoted, but they are not interested in defending the 
movement. This situation must be brought out into the open 
before the party. It is the party leaders themselves who come 
out and say to us: He is one of our men, he has his party card, 
help him, give him a push. But then, we fail to receive support 
form these individuals when such support is needed. 
  [Announcer] The military and civilian dictatorship employed 
the extreme measure of setting up a regime that was communist in 
nature. [video cuts to show Solis Palma speaking to a crowd] 
  [Solis Palma] When someone says, I have the money, the 
answer 
is, you do not have anything, because here, no one owns 
anything. Everything belongs to the Panamanian state; it belongs 
to the government. [break in video] We cannot rule out the 
possibility of our own currency. 
  [Announcer] The Panamanian people and their true civilian 
leaders were repressed by way of violence. The rights of the 
citizens were violated, and the free press was shut down. There 
was chaos, violence, and desolation. [video cuts to show Rodolfo 
Chiari de Leon, former government minister, seated and speaking 
at a meeting] 
  [Chiari de Leon] In light of this, we have proceeded to 
appoint censors to LA PRENSA, QUIBO, EXTRA, and EL SIGLO. These 
are the dailies that have been attacking the government most. 
[video cuts to show Manuel Noriega speaking to a group] 
  [Noriega] Those people who are under arrest -- we should 
not be alarmed about this. This was necessary. It was 
necessary to undo the prevailing impasse. Currently we have... 
[pauses] we still have approximately 120 individuals under 
arrest. We are placing them under the jurisdiction of the 
administration. Measures were taken to ensure that it would not 
be said that they were stripped naked. Measures were taken so 
that a priest and a doctor were present, as well as a 
high-ranking officer to check all of this and to check those who 
pretend to have a heart condition after being arrested. 
[laughter] [video cuts to show civilians being beaten by members 
of the FPD; video cuts to show former President Eric Arturo 
Delvalle addressing a crowd] 
  [Arturo Delvalle] I agree with General Noriega that the 
groups must be maintained. I would like to reactivate the 
command. I am going to talk to Commander Solis Palma, the 
civilian commander, to reactivate it. [video cuts to show 
Manuel Noriega addressing a crowd] 
  [Noriega] One territory, one flag, and not one step 
backward, 
damn it! [shouts of approval heard among crowd, applause] 
[video cuts to show an unidentified female Dignity Battalion 
member speaking at a podium] 
  [Dignity Battalion member] We have shown the world the 
stamina, the bravery, and the courage of Panamanian women who 
have voluntarily enrolled in the Dignity Battalions and have 
brandished for the first time a T-65 or an M-16. [applause] You 
may rest assured that in the event that our national integrity 
and sovereignty requires it, these [two-second break in audio] 
in the hands of our women, will do what is necessary. [Video 
cuts to show Dayra de Carrizo, wife of Legislative Assembly 
President Celso Carrizo, speaking at a podium] 
  [Dayra de Carrizo, identified by caption] Panama has one 
single territory and one single flag. Not one single step 
backward! Not one single step backward! [applause] [video cuts 
to show medium shot of Manuel Noriega speaking at an outdoor 
podium prior to a military parade] 
  [Noriega] Welcome Messrs. representatives of political 
parties, PALA [Labor Party], Republican Party, and PRD. For the 
first time in the Republic's history, soldiers representing our 
Armed Forces are marching alongside the Dignity Battalions -- in 
other words, the people who bear arms in order to survive. 
[applause; crowd chants: "Not one step backward!"] 
  We have armed the people, and these arms will no longer be 
taken away, because they belong to the people! So, you can just 
forget about Noriega. Perhaps Noriega is the nicest person out 
of all of those still to come. If you do not believe me, just 
ask [Major Jose Heraclides] Trujillo or [Lieutenant Colonel 
Luis] Cordoba. In turn, it is preferable that you put up with 
Noriega. 
  The Defense Forces have said not a single step backward. The 
Dignity Battalions have said not a single step backward. In the 
name of the people who are looking ahead with courage, this 
Panamanian commander repeats from this podium what is already 
our doctrine, our principle, and our prayer: Not one single 
step backward! [applause; crowd chants: "Not one single step 
backward!"] [video cut shows several short recordings without
