  [Abstract] Traditional 
means of mechanizing and automating existing technology have 
been exhausted. The creation of robotic equipment (primarily 
manipulator arms) to perform extraction operations is described. 
The use of robotics can sharply increase mechanization of mining 
operations in the entire extraction area, automate monitoring 
and control operations, and determine the actual efficiency of 
use of cutting machines, and the adaptability of machines for 
complex geological and mining conditions. The difficulties in 
replacing a human operator, primarily human cognitive functions 
are discussed. It is noted that all the pieces are in place for 
the use of robotics, but they have yet to be applied to mining 
operations.
