  [Text] [Shesterkina voice over video of truck 
emerging from reprocessing plant] The Russian Ministry of 
Atomic Energy, having examined the results of the operation and 
the state of all units of the complex for the vitrification of 
radioactive waste at the Mayak chemical combine, has authorized 
its continued operation. This furnace is the only one on the 
territory of the former USSR and the most efficient in the 
world, although this work is also done by Britain and France. 
Here industrial-grade plutonium for nuclear electric power 
stations is extracted from reprocessed nuclear fuel and the 
radioactive waste is vitrified and placed in storehouses. 
Beneath me are about 150 million curies of radioactivity 
rendered harmless from nuclear fuel used not only in Russia but 
also in Armenia, Ukraine, Bulgaria, Slovakia, Germany, Hungary, 
and Finland. It is all too obvious that, having our own nuclear 
electric power stations, an inconceivable number of missiles, 
icebreakers, and submarines, we have accumulated such a quantity 
of weapons-grade and industrial-grade plutonium, whose decay 
takes 24,000 years, that we are doomed to conducting our own 
reprocessing. [video shows exterior, interior of
