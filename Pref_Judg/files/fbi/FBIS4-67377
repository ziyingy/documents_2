  [Text] Moscow April 18 ITAR-TASS -- The area of the Sea of 
Japan in which the Russian Pacific Fleet dumped some of its 
radioactive wastes does not show above-normal levels of 
radioactivity, according to preliminary data released by a joint 
Russian-japanese-South Korean expedition which just finished 
studying the area. 
  Russian Naval Captain Gennadiy Vorobyev, deputy head of the 
radiation and chemical security department, told ITAR-TASS on 
Monday that during the month-long expedition, Russian, Japanese 
and South Korean scientists took samples of sea water from their 
base onboard the research ship "Okean", which belongs to the 
Russian federal hydrometeorology and environmental monitoring 
service. 
  The expedition's work was prompted by the worries of several 
countries in the region that the dumping of radioactive 
materials in the Sea of Japan by the Russian Pacific Fleet in 
October, 1993, might lead to higher radiation levels.
