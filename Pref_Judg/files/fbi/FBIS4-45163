  [Text] Minister of Government German Quiroga has asserted 
that almost all the coca produced in Chapare goes for drug 
trafficking and does not deserve executive branch support to 
legalize it. 
  Quiroga thus dismissed any possibility that the Decree on 
the 
Industrialization of Coca will be modified. This decree bans 
the industrialization of coca produced in Chapare, Cochabamba. 
  The minister asserted: "It seems some coca producers want to 
legalize it but the government is not planning to do so because 
everyone in Bolivia knows that 80 or 90 percent of the coca 
produced in Chapare is surplus to requirements." 
  He said that the surplus production is earmarked exclusively 
for drug trafficking. To think of legalizing it would mean 
"legalizing the raw material for the production of drugs." 
  Quiroga said there is no chance of this happening because it 
would go against the drug enforcement policy. 
  He explained that the controversial supreme decree and its 
regulations on the industrialization of coca complies with 
current Bolivian laws and international agreements. As such the 
criticisms it has prompted are unjustified. 
  Quiroga believes "in Bolivia there is good coca and bad 
coca. 
The good coca deserve the support of all organization for its 
industrialization so that it may be marketed properly." 
  He added: "The bad coca does not deserve any support because 
it is earmarked for drug trafficking." 
  He said government authorities believe some leaders want the 
bad or surplus coca production to circulate freely in the 
country. This is not possible because by allowing this the 
government would be promoting drug trafficking. 
  Quiroga concluded: "If the government yields to pressure 
seeking to legalize coca from areas that produce surplus 
production, it would be violating measures like Law No. 1008 and 
some international agreements. This is not possible and will 
not happen."
