  [Text] Hong Kong's senior customs official last night 
dismissed claims that the department is helping China crackdown 
on the smuggling of state secrets into the territory. 
  The Beijing-funded Hong Kong China News Service reported 
yesterday that Hong Kong last year passed to Shenzhen 
authorities 49 cases of "official document" smuggling. 
  Mainland customs officials said Chinese tourists wanted to 
sell economic and trade secrets. 
  Last night a legislator, Emily Lau, accused Beijing of 
"muddying the waters" by releasing the report soon after 
journalist Xi Yang was jailed for stealing economic secrets. 
  Don Watson, the Customs and Excise commissioner, said no 
documents were given to Chinese authorities. 
  "We have co-operation with the Chinese on a number of issues 
but not official documents," he said. 
  Mainland customs officials reported 20 cases of tourists 
trying to smuggle classified documents out of China in the first 
three months of this year.
