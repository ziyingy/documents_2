  [Text] Beijing, May 30 (AFP)--The Chinese government 
denied Monday a report by the Tibet Information Network (TIN) 
that hundreds of people had demonstrated Saturday in Lhasa, the 
Tibetan capital. 
  "No incident of this kind occurred, according to our 
information," a government spokesman for the Tibet Autonomous 
Region said by telephone. He made no other comment. 
  TIN, a London-based agency that monitors human rights and 
developments in Tibet, said Sunday that between 200 and 300 
people had protested in Lhasa against an increase in taxes for 
shopkeepers. 
  Several demonstrators were beaten up and five were arrested, 
TIN said, adding that three foreigners who witnessed the 
incident had had their passports confiscated. 
  Accounts garnered from foreign tourists who have recently 
been in Tibet say the situation in Lhasa is still very tense, 
and the Chinese police and military have high-profile 
deployments there. 
  The Chinese authorities are apparently concerned that 
anti-Chinese sentiment among Tibetans is being inflamed by 
inflation and unemployment, the sources say. 
  In May 1993, demonstrations erupted against rising prices 
and 
quickly degenerated into protests against China's occupation of 
Tibet. 
  China annexed Tibet in 1959 after crushing a 
pro-independence 
movement. 
  According to human rights organisations, hundreds of Tibetan 
dissidents are in Chinese jails, many of them arrested after a 
wave of anti-Chinese rallies in 1987.
