  [Text] Tokyo, Feb 17 KYODO -- The Fisheries Agency said 
Thursday [17 February] an International Whaling Commission (IWC) 
working group will discuss a French proposal to create a whale 
sanctuary in Antarctic waters at its meeting on 20-24 February 
in Norfork Island, Australia. 
  The last IWC conference, held in Kyoto last May, decided to 
set up a working group to deal with the controversial proposal 
which sharply divided anti-and pro-whaling nations. 
  Agency officials said the Norfolk Island meeting will be 
attended by representatives from 27 members of the 40-country 
commission, including Kazuo Shima, the agency's deputy director 
general. 
  They said the results of discussions there will be reported 
at the next IWC meeting in Mexico on 23-27 May.
