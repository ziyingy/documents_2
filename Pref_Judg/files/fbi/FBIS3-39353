<F P=106> [Article by Helmut Weixler: "Six and One-Half Weeks; The </F>
Nightmare Issue of Agriculture Will Determine Whether Austria 
Becomes an EU Member in 1995, or Not Until 1997"] 
  [Text] The timetable has been set. Several hectic 
ministers' meetings in Brussels in February; a special 
last-minute summit meeting on the political deal; presentation 
of the membership agreements to the European Parliament on 10 
March, naturally at the last minute; heated debates in 
Strassburg, on 4 May voting by members of the European 
Parliament. And already on 6 May, the ceremonial signing of the 
membership agreements in Brussels. Parallel to this, discussion 
by the parliament in Vienna, referendum on 12 June, and 
lickety-split, before you know it, on 1 January 1995 Austria is 
a member of the European Union [EU]. 
  Possible. Probable. But not certain. 
  The feeling of uncertainty is growing over whether the 
negotiators in Brussels will actually win the race against time. 
The enormous delay over the issue of agriculture, the most 
complicated and extensive issue in the game of negotiation 
poker, is causing major headaches. Above all the "obvious 
nonchalance" (a diplomat) of the responsible parties within the 
European Commission, more precisely: among the members of 
Executive Board 6 [GD 6], which is responsible for agricultural 
issues, is giving rise to increased vexation among those who are 
in favor of membership, as well as among the twelve EU member 
states. The Commission still has not presented its position 
papers on a whole list of important issues -- six and one-half 
weeks before the targeted end to the negotiations. The 
Commission's rude reply: "There is already enough material that 
the member states could be studying in the meantime." 
  From the very beginning of the negotiations "GD 6 has 
developed a special talent for presenting its papers late," 
bickers a spokesperson for one EU member state. Even those who 
support membership have been disappointed with the GD 6 
negotiating leadership, which they have kindly described as 
being "headstrong." Austria, for example, was promised a 
statement by June 1993. The first guidelines for negotiations 
over the agriculture issue turned up on 24 November. An internal 
paper from the Foreign Ministry pointed with concern "to a delay 
that will be hard to make up in the negotiating timetable." Up 
until 15 December 1993 the Commission could at least use the 
excuse that its officials were totally occupied with the arduous 
GATT negotiations. But GATT has been over with now for a month 
and a half. 
  Simply in terms of time, things are getting alarmingly 
close. 
That is why the traveling diplomatic corps is now running at 
full speed; the Austrian ministers are seeking direct contact 
with their colleagues in the European capital cities. Two weeks 
ago Minister of Agriculture Franz Fischler met with his German 
colleagues and with EU Commissioner of Agriculture Rene Steichen 
in Berlin; last week Fischler jetted to Rome; this Thursday [28 
January] the speedy Franz is expected in Brussels. 
  In any case, everything must be settled by the final 
deadline 
on 10 March. If by this date the membership agreements have not 
been presented to the European Parliament, meticulously and 
accurately translated into all nine EU languages, then the 
Euro-delegates will not be able to discuss the issue prior to 
the new elections in June. As to what would happen then, there 
are two schools of thought: Some think negotiations would simply 
continue and the newly elected European Parliament would debate 
the membership agreements in the fall. Austria and the 
Scandinavians will become members on 1 July, 1995, or in the 
worst case scenario on 1 January 1996. So what is one year? 
  In contrast, a top official of one member state cautions 
against the psychological effects of a setback: "If all is not 
completed by March the balloon will deflate, then it is quite 
probable that the European Union will turn to the task of 
internal reform, and the next opportunity for membership will 
not arise until 1997 at the earliest." The "open window" would 
be closed. In 1997, Austria would then have to bark at the gate 
of the EU along with reform states like the Czech Republic, 
Poland, or Hungary. 
  Still, the Austrians continue to radiate optimism. "We have 
the political determination to get it done by 1 March, and so 
does the EU," emphasizes Ambassador Manfred Scheich, chief 
negotiator in Brussels. The official in charge, EU Commissioner 
Hans van den Broek, is also pressing for a political tour de 
force. This will require that the major problem of agriculture 
be resolved at least in its basic points. At any rate, it is 
clear that the many technical details cannot be worked out by 10 
March. 
  For this reason, the foreign ministers are planning to clear 
the medium-sized problems out of the way in the form of a first 
negotiating package, at the sixth round of negotiations held on 
7 and 8 February in Brussels. The very large pieces will then be 
available for all types of bartering at a special summit meeting 
announced by the Greek chairman of the European Council, to be 
held on 28 February and 1 March, or more probably on 7-8 March. 
  The coalition is counting on a successful EU finish. Last 
week a governmental summit in Parliament, chaired by Federal 
Chancellor Franz Vranitzky and Vice Chancellor Erich Busek, 
plotted the course heading toward the finish line (see table). 
The domestic policy timetable is already set in its broad 
outlines. As early as 15 March the Council of Ministers will 
submit the membership agreements to the Parliament. At the end 
of April, Minister of the Interior Franz Loeschnak will announce 
the referendum to be held on 12 June. 
  Just as the outcome of the negotiations is being sold to the 
people, people are busy racking their brains at the Austrian 
Foreign Ministry over this referendum. A paper from the 
undersecretary for Europe promises that already in the coming 
week, "Demner and Merlicek and Publico will be completing their 
plans for the heated phase prior to the referendum." 
  If it actually comes to this phase. Because not only could 
the ship, heading on a course toward Brussels, still be smashed 
on the reefs of agriculture, secondary residences, and transit, 
which can be seen at a great distance--there is also the danger 
of running aground on several dangerous shoals. That is why up 
to now both sides of the negotiations have most painstakingly 
avoided broaching the subject of a "budget." Still, all are 
awaiting tensely the day when the southern states will present 
their demands with which they will allow their wealthy northern 
cousins to buy their acceptance of club membership. "The longer 
Spain, Portugal, and Greece wait, the more expensive it 
becomes," speculates one Commission insider. For the poorer 
southern countries this is their last opportunity to get 
anything. The next round of membership negotiations will be 
conducted with the economically ill cousins in East Europe. 
  The course heading toward the end of negotiations is still 
marked with unexpected pitfalls; often negotiations break down 
over trivial matters. For instance, Ambassador Scheich was able 
to conclude only two negotiating matters instead of three last 
Friday. In trade policy the EU suddenly wanted to allow only an 
eight-week transition period in the conversion of the forms for 
certificates of origin; Austria was pushing for at least four 
months. The issue was tabled until the next ambassadors' meeting 
on 3 February. As chief negotiator Scheich said with a sigh: 
"Little by little we will get it done."

<H5>  The Issues Breaking Down the Negotiations </H5>
<H5>  Agriculture </H5>
  EU Position: 
  Immediate lifting of border controls, immediate lowering of 
prices for farm products to the European level (on the average 
by 17 percent, for some products by around 40 percent). The 
resulting losses in income experienced by the farmers (8 billion 
shillings) should be compensated for by the finance minister 
over a transition period. Swift opening of the market to EU 
agricultural products. 
  Austrian Position: 
  Adjustment of prices for farm products to EU level within 
seven years. In addition to this, membership equalization quotas 
(BAB), a type of customs duty on imports, should be levied. 
Austria is insisting upon border controls. (Another plan is 
under consideration, however, in which the BAB could be levied 
internally.) Gradual opening up of market to foreign 
agricultural products. 
<H5>  Transit </H5>
  EU Position: 
  With EU membership there will be an increase only in inland 
traffic; the transit agreement would apply only in "ecologically 
sensitive" regions, that is in alpine regions; increasing the 
38-ton limit to 40 tons as is the norm in the EU; no border 
controls for ecology points; expansion of the ecology points 
system to include bilateral trade and Austrian freighters. 
  Austrian Position: 
  Content of the Transit Agreement must be included in full in 
the membership agreement: validity until 31 December 2003 and to 
include the entire territory of the Federal Republic; no 
increase in the 38-ton limit; the expansion of the ecology 
points system to bilateral trade is accepted, its application to 
Austrian freighters is still under discussion; rejection of 
border controls, ecology points should be regulated within the 
country. 
<H5>  Secondary Residences </H5>
  EU Position: 
  Austria may restrict the acquisition of secondary 
residences, 
but only on a strictly nondiscriminatory basis. The Danish model 
(in order to acquire a secondary residence a person must have 
already lived in Austria for five years and/or maintain his or 
her primary residence here) will not be applied to Austria. 
  Austrian Position: 
  Austria has come up with a new proposal for compromise that 
would permit the use of the "Danish model," but only in 
particularly "sensitive" regions. These sensitive regions are 
identified based upon two criteria: the number of secondary 
residences as a percentage of total existing dwellings and the 
scarcity of property for building.
