of Them"] 
  [Text] The birth rate of our population in the last ten 
years has had a general tendency to decrease. For 1990-1993, it 
went from 12.7 births per 1000 inhabitants to 10.8. This is a 15 
percent decrease. In particular, in Kiev it has been 28 percent, 
in the Crimean Republic 25 percent, in the Kharkivska oblast 21 
percent, in the Donetska oblast 20.3 percent, and in the 
Zaporizka and Dnipropetrovska oblasts, 19 percent. 
  The highest birth rate last year was in the western oblasts. 
  As the numbers show, the tradition of having many children 
has been lost in Ukraine. Since 1964, each woman has given 
birth, in the course of her lifetime, on the average to only 
about two children; this does not assure even a simple 
replacement of the population, for which 2.2 to 2.4 children per 
woman are needed. This is one of the lowest rates in the world. 
Among developed countries, Ukraine ranks only 26th in birth 
rate, and it is in last place among the countries of the former 
USSR.
