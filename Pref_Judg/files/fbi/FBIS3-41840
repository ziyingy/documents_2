  [Text] Tbilisi. The republic's Ministry of Health has 
informed us that no new cholera cases have been registered up to 
now. Moreover, those who fell ill during the epidemic have 
already been released from the republic's hospital for 
infectious diseases. The nidus of the epidemic will be viewed as 
having been liquidated if there are no new cases once the second 
incubation period has passed.
