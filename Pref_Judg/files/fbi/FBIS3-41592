  [Text] Rivas -- The campesinos are using forest resources 
indiscriminately: some for their own consumption and others to 
sell. However, ``the problem has grown worse since the 
government's distribution of land to people demobilized from the 
Resistance and the Army,'' said the departmental representative 
of IRENA [Institute of Natural Resources], Maurice Gutierrez 
Pascuas. 
  The regions most hurt by this logging are Sapoa, Cardenas, 
Ostional, Escalante, San Juan del Sur, and La Chocolata. In 
these places 300,000 trees will be planted to halt 
desertification. 
  ``The turnover of lands to demobilized combatants has 
worsened the problem, as there is no control over them, and they 
are often highly unstable persons who will resort to violence,'' 
said the IRENA representative. 
  Environmental protection campaigns must make the campesinos 
and people in general more aware. ``We are not refusing to let 
them use the wood, but the forests must become a perpetual and 
sustainable resource,'' continued Gutierrez.

  Ometepe Island is one of the national parks that has been 
declared a nature reserve. ``In this reserve there is a lot of 
poaching of animal species,'' and we are unable to cover the 
entire territory. 
  ``We appealed to the Army, and that is how we were able to 
seize thousands of turtle and bird eggs. In the La Flor Reserve 
we are working with the police and we have managed to wipe out 
contraband.'' 
  The IRENA representative criticized the lack of 
communication 
between independent government agencies. The department's 
environmental problems worsened when the National Institute for 
Agrarian Reform--at the order of the central 
government--distributed lands to demobilized combatants without 
consulting them. 
  ``Former members of the Resistance and of the EPS [Sandinist 
People's Army] cut down trees in order to plant and to sell 
wood.'' For future actions, ``there should be better internal 
communication,'' Gutierrez said vehemently. 
  He praised the efforts of student environmentalists, for 
with 
their help we have achieved many goals. ``The secondary school 
Ecological Brigades have done a great deal of work,'' and soon 
we will plant 20,000 trees in Ometepe Island. 
  Finally, he appealed to the entire community to avert the 
desertification of Rivas. ``The people must realize that we have 
to protect the environment in order to avoid what happened in 
Occidente, which had relied on the cultivation of cotton as a 
single crop: desertification.''
