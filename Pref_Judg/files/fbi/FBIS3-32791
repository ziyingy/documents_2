  [Text] Soon, the prototype of a sugarcane harvester capable 
of operating in wet soil will be tested. The project is being 
developed by the Center for the Development of Agricultural 
Machinery of the scientific hub in Holguin Province. The new 
machine includes a trailer or cart and its basic mechanism is 
similar to that of the KTP. The new harvester uses tracks 
[esteras] instead of tires and is much lighter than the 
conventional harvester to prevent damage to the cane stumps when 
the water content of the soil exceeds the normal limits. 
  This project is one of the four tasks assigned to the 
scientific hub of Holguin in view of a need to equip the country 
with machinery capable of continuing the harvest during rainy 
seasons.
