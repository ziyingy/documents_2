  [Text] Beijing, 23 Feb (XINHUA) -- The Ministry of 
Chemical Industry recently issued an emergency circular urging 
chemical industrial departments and chemical industrial 
enterprises in all localities to take prompt action to increase 
chemical fertilizer production and to increase the effective 
supplies of chemical fertilizers to meet spring farming needs. 
  With the start of the busy spring farming season, chemical 
fertilizers have been in short supply in some localities. At 
the same time, chemical fertilizer production has continued to 
decrease due to increased costs, shortage of funds, and other 
problems -- the situation is grim. The emergency circular urged 
all localities to faithfully carry out their chemical fertilizer 
production plans, elaborately organize their production work, 
carry out the preferential policies the state has adopted toward 
chemical fertilizer production enterprises, and create favorable 
external conditions for chemical fertilizer production. The 
circular also urged all enterprises to directly sell their 
chemical fertilizers to grass-roots supply and marketing 
cooperatives or peasant households, to market their products 
jointly with grass-roots farming materials supply and marketing 
cooperatives, or to appoint these cooperatives as their sales 
agents, in order to reduce intermediate links and to ease 
peasants' burdens. The circular also urged all enterprises to 
properly arrange loans for the storage of chemical fertilizers 
during slack seasons. 
  It has been learned that the Ministry of Chemical Industry 
will soon send six work groups to all localities to look into 
the situation of chemical fertilizer production and marketing.
