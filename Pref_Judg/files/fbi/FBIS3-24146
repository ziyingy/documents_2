<H6>  1. Coal Production </H6>
<H5>  1.1. Coal Extraction. </H5>
  Some 198.3 million metric tons of coal (plus 1.3 million 
metric tons toward the plan adopted by enterprises, 100.7 
percent) were extracted from January to August 1993; the decline 
in extaction compared with 1992 was 21.9 million metric tons 
(10.0 percent). 
  The trend of a decrease in the amount of coal mined, 
compared 
with 1992, is continuing; the rate of decrease rose 0.3 points 
(from 9.7 to 10.0 percent) from July to August. Compared with 
July, the amount of coal mined decreased by 949,000 metric tons, 
or 4.4 percent. 
  It should be noted that reduction of the volume of coal 
mined, compared with what was extracted in 1992, was stipulated 
in the plans of 28 of the 34 associations (82.4 percent), 
because the overall coal extraction plan was set lower by 23.2 
million metric tons (10.6 percent).

    Fifteen of the 37 joint-stock companies, associations, and 
concerns (40.5 percent) did not meet their plan targets, 
underfulfilling them by 1.35 million metric tons of coal.

  The principal reasons for the decrease in the volume of coal 
mined: 
  --the decline in effective demand for coal products; 
  --substantial reduction of capacities. It is expected that 
there will be a reduction of 22 million metric tons in 1993, at 
a time when provision is being made for the introduction of only 
12 million metric tons, that is, a negative balance on the order 
of 10 million metric tons; 
  --a decrease in the amount of preparatory operations 
conducted, and as a consequence, lack of the needed number of 
stoping faces. Stripping and development workings at the mines 
were reduced by 82.4 kilometers (11.0 percent) compared with 
1992, and the average number of stoping faces in operation 
decreased by 44.7 faces (6.0 percent). For this reason, 
extraction losses in the January-August 1993 period added up to 
4.9 million metric tons. At open pits, the planned volume of 
stripping over the 8-month period was underfulfilled by 41.4 
million cubic meters (6.5 percent), a reduction of 43.1 million 
cubic meters (6.8 percent) compared with 1992; 
  --the lack of material and technical resources in the 
volumes 
needed (70 percent of the rolled ferrous metals, 60 percent of 
the timber for pit props, 35 percent of the flexible and power 
cable, 21 percent of the electric locomotives, and 48 percent of 
the ties were delivered), caused mainly by the shortage of 
finances. This is having a harmful effect on the operation of 
mining equipment and increasing the number of injuries. 
Principally because of the high accident rate and equipment 
wear, the average daily load on a stoping face has decreased by 
16 metric tons (3.2 percent) compared with last year, and coal 
extraction losses because of this were 1.3 million metric tons 
higher than last year; and 
  --it also should be noted that coal extraction losses 
because 
of the stoppages at coal mining enterprises in the Kuzbass in 
June (compulsory leave for workers because of insufficient funds 
to pay their wages) amounted to 600,000 metric tons and strikes 
in June (at Vorkuta) and in August (146 mines in Russia) 
resulted in losses of 213,000 metric tons. 
<H3>  1.2. The Processing and Output of Clean Coal, Large and 
Medium-Sized Grades and Briquets </H3>
  On the whole, enterprises engaged in processing coal have 
been operating steadily, based on the amount of coal brought to 
the mills. At the same time, it should be pointed out that the 
mutual indebtedness of the mills and the mines (open pits) and 
settlements with consumers of the finished product (nonpayments) 
are the principal reason for the mills' stoppages because of the 
lack of coal, and they are affecting the mills' preparation for 
operation in the winter of 1993-1994. 
  The main production indicators in coal concentration are 
cited in the table:

briquets 


  The principal reason for nonfulfillment of the plan to turn 
out graded coals is that insufficient quantities of coal were 
delivered for processing because the extraction plan was not 
fulfilled. There was a shortage of railcars to transport the 
coal for concentration because rail tariffs were not paid and 
customers refused to pay in advance. For these reasons, only 
eight of the 26 associations met their target for graded coal; 
the "Borodinskiy" Open Pit and the Krasnoyarskugol" Association 
practically discontinued turning it out because of the lack of 
contracts with customers. 
  The "Rostovugol" and "Gukovugol" PO [production 
associations] 
and the "Obukhovskaya" AO [Joint-Stock Company] failed 
completely to turn out graded anthracite because of the mines' 
production recession, although this grade is in demand. 
<H5>  1.3. The Shipment of Coal </H5>
  In the January-August period, the coal shipment plan for the 
coal industry as a whole was fulfilled by 100.2 percent, with 
400,000 metric tons above the plan being shipped. However, the 
situation sharply deteriorated in August, and the plan was 
underfulfilled by 230,000 metric tons, including all the 
principal coals. The quantity actually shipped over the 8-month 
period decreased by 27.5 million metric tons compared with the 
same period in 1992. 
  The main reason for the unsatisfactory work in August and 
the 
decrease in the volume of coal shipped, compared with 1992, is 
nonfulfullment of the coal extraction plan in August, a decrease 
of 21.9 million metric tons in the amount of coal extracted 
compared with the same period in 1992, and MPS [RF Ministry of 
Railways] railroads' restriction of coal amounts in coal 
enterprises' applications because they are constantly in debt 
for transportation fees. In addition, the decrease in shipment 
volumes has been affected by the increased railroad tariffs 
beginning 1 August 1993, 2.2 times higher than those in effect 
since 1 April 1993. 
<H6>  2. Coal Sales </H6>
  Coal is being delivered this year under more difficult 
conditions than in 1992; this is mainly because of coal industry 
enterprises' continuously deteriorating financial condition. 
First of all, the higher prices for coal, as well as the rise in 
railroad tariffs, have led to a sharp increase in customer 
indebtedness: it increased by 3.5 times as much in the 
July-August period, reaching 307 billion rubles [R] as of 1 
September 1993, according to current data. Secondly, the coal 
enterprises are delaying payment of freight charges. As of 1 
September 1993, the debt to the railroads was in excess of R153 
billion, including R102 billion to the Kemerovo Railroad, which 
led to a cutback in the supply of railcars for coal shipment. 
The poor competitiveness of the Kizelovskiy, Bogoslovksiy, and 
Podmoskovniy coals, compared with gas, is having an effect on 
deliveries as well. 
  As a result, the total volume of coal deliveries in July and 
August decreased by 22.5 percent compared with the first 6 
months of the year, as shown by the following data:

<H6>  Coal Machinebuilding </H6>
  3.1. Commodity production valued at R30.6 billion, which is 
68.4 percent of the planned output, was turned out by coal 
machinebuilding plants over the 8 months in 1993. As a result, 
products valued at R14.1 billion were not delivered. Compared 
with the same period last year, the volume of commodity 
production decreased by an average 32.2 percent. Production of 
the principal output is shown by the following data:

  Nonfulfillment of the plan and the decrease in production 
volume stem principally from the substantial cutback in the work 
force (by 3,698 employees or by 11.4 percent) and the insolvency 
of enterprises, which make it difficult to provide materials and 
component parts. 
<H6>  4. Capital Construction </H6>
  4.1 According to the startup program for 1993, the level at 
which capital investments were put into use for the annual 
volume as a whole was 25.6 percent and 31.6 percent for 
construction and installation work over the 8-month period, 
including 37.4 percent and 45.3 percent, respectively, at mines; 
19.6 percent and 25.9 percent at open pits; 25.9 percent and 
31.8 percent at coal processing facilities; 21.9 percent and 
26.7 percent at preschool institutions; 21.4 percent and 29.7 
percent at schools; and 15.6 percent and 25.5 percent at 
hospitals. Some 262,100 square meters of housing, including the 
proportion for individuals and ZhSK [Housing Construction 
Cooperatives], or 19.3 percent of the annual volume, were put 
into use. 
  4.2 The major facilities not put into use during the 8-month 
period: 
  --capacities to extract coal at the "Bachatskiy" Pit (2 
million metric tons in the "Kuzbassrazrezugol" Production 
Association), the "Taldinskiy" Pit (500,000 metric tons in the 
"Kuzbassshakhtostroy" Production Association), and the 
"Tyulganskiy" Pit (400,000 metric tons in the "Bashkirugol" 
Production Association); 
  --three kindergartens for 610 children (the 
"Kuzbassrazrezugol," "Kuzbassshakhtostroy," and "Sakhalinugol" 
production associations); and 
  --a 440-bed hospital complex with a polyclinic to 
accommodate 
1,000 visits (the "Leninskugol" Production Association). 
  4.3 The main reason for the extremely unsatisfactory 
situation in capital construction, as in the sector as a whole, 
is the financial crisis. As of 1 September 1993, the budget debt 
was R353.3 billion, including R86.3 billion for production 
development and R40.3 billion for TsKV [centrally convertible 
currency] financing. In August, the "Rosugol" Company, jointly 
with the Department of Coal Industry and representatives of the 
sector's construction organizations, reviewed the progress of 
construction starts and made appropriate decisions. 
<H6>  5. Economic Indicators </H6>
  5.1 The commodity production turned out over the 8-month 
period is valued at R793.6 billion in enterprises' comparable 
wholesale prices, which is 9.7 percent less than the same period 
last year. 
  5.2 The output of commodity production per employee was 
R1.3791 million, a decrease of 9.4 percent from 1992. 
  5.3 The average number of officially listed employees 
engaged 
directly in industrial production in the January-August period 
was 575,400, a decrease of 2,343 persons from 1992. There has 
been a steady outflow of personnel from coal enterprises since 
May. This is because of the unsatisfactory working conditions 
and the wage level, as well as seasonal fluctuations throughout 
the year. 

<FIG ID=FBIS-USR-026-75A>           Number of PPP [Workers Directly Engaged in Industrial Production] in 1993 </FIG>





    5.4 The wage of a worker in the coal industry in July 1993 
was R109,349, an increase of R25,694, or 30.7 percent, over June 
1993. The largest increases were in the production associations 
"Sakhalinugol" (171.9 percent), "Kizelugol" (162.5 percent), 
"Rostovugol" (161.6 percent), "Vostsibugol" (156.5 percent), 
"Primorskugol" (154.1 percent), and "Vorkutaugol" (150.7 
percent), and the smallest increases were in the production 
associations "Gukovugol" (106.7 percent), "Tulaugol" (108.9 
percent), and "Yakutugol" (111.5 percent). This wide fluctuation 
in the wage increase in July 1993 stems from the different 
procedure for calculating wages (taking wages into account with 
and without indexing to measure the rise in consumer prices in 
the second quarter of 1993) because of the delay in transferring 
budget funds for implementation of the sectorial wage agreement. 
  Compared with the same period last year, the average monthly 
wage of a worker in the industry over 7 months in 1993 increased 
by 7.6 times as much, reaching R66,354. The rate of the wage 
increase ranges from 652.8 percent in the "Leninskugol" 
Association to 1,001.8 percent in the "Severovostokugol" 
Association. 
  In June 1993, the wage of a worker in the coal industry was 
R88,529, which is R35,727 (40.4 percent) lower than the wage in 
the petroleum industry, R55,270 (62.4 percent) lower than the 
wage in the gas industry, and R2,711 (3.1 percent) lower than 
the wage in nonferrous metallurgy. In its wage level, the coal 
industry held fourth place in June (instead of third place in 
May), since in other sectors it had risen at a faster rate. The 
electric power engineering industry (with a wage of R87,921 in 
June) came close to the coal industry because of this. 
  In the first half of the year, the rate of increase in the 
average wage of coal industry employees was the highest (708 
percent) among the basic sectors of industry and industry as a 
whole in Russia (865.9 percent). 
  5.5. The production cost of 1 metric ton of coal from 
January 
to July 1993 was R3,021.58, which is R219.27 lower than the plan 
and R2,670.29 higher than in 1992. The increase in production 
cost over 1992 stems from the increase in the wage 
fund--R748.35--and the rise in prices and rates for material 
outlays--R921.86. 
  The funds saved for all extraction added up to R35.94 
billion. 
  5.6 As of 1 September 1993, the credit indebtedness of coal 
industry enterprises amounted to R370.9 billion and the debt of 
buyers and clients (the incurred debt) was R426.8 billion. In 
August, as a result of the higher prices for coal products, the 
steady inflationary excess of credit debt was abruptly replaced 
by an excess of incurred debt. 
<H6>  6. Shareholding and Privatization </H6>
  In conformity with the President's Edict No. 1702 of 30 
December 1992, 54 coal industry associations and enterprises are 
due to be changed into open-type joint-stock companies. 
  Two associations ("Gukovugol" and the "Kuznetskugol" 
Concern) 
and 21 enterprises, including eight mines, two open pits, two OF 
[concentration mills], four machinery plants, and two 
mine-building combines were changed into joint-stock companies. 
  In the January-August period, the Central Working Commission 
on Privatization of the RF MInistry of Fuel and Energy reviewed 
materials on 32 associations and enterprises and 36 directives 
were issued by the RF Goskomimushchestvo [State Committee on the 
Administration of State Property]. As of 1 September 1993, 82 
directives were issued in the coal industry on the creation of 
joint-stock companies, 40 of them by the Goskomimushchestvo. 
  As of 1 September 1993, in the associations and enterprises 
listed in Supplements 1 to 4 of the Russian President's Edict 
No. 1702 of 30 December 1992, the following coal mining 
enterprises and machinebuilding plants were changed into 
joint-stock companies and founding documents were approved for 
them: "Kuzbassrazrezugol," "Vorkutaugol," "Sibantratsit," 
"Krasnoyarskugol," and "Rostovugol," and the Kopeyskiy, 
Shakhtinskiy, Kamenskiy, Aleksandrovskiy, and Istrinskiy 
("Uglemash") machinebuilding plants. 
  Documents for approval of the joint-stock companies of the 
Skuratovskiy, Skopinskiy, and Atkarskiy machinebuilding plants, 
the "Leningradslanets" Association, and the 
"Mosbassshakhtostroy" Combine are now in the RF 
Goskomimushchestvo for its consideration. 
  Materials on changing the production associations 
"Dalvostugol," "Tulaugol," "Kizelugol," "Sakhalinugol," 
"Bashkirugol," and "Belovougol"; the "Leninskugol," 
"Kiselevugol," and "Prokopyevskugol" associations; the 
"Severokuzbassugol" and "Khakasugol" concerns; the 
"Giprouglemash" Institute; and the "Shakter" Rest Home into 
joint-stock companies have been reviewed in the Central Working 
Commission and are being prepared for transmittal to the RF 
Goskomimushchestvo. 
  Materials on the "Vakhrushevugol" Association have been 
transferred to the working group for its consideration. 
  Materials on the "Vostsibugol" Production Association and 
the 
"Katekuglestroy" Combine are being prepared for the working 
group's review. 
  In accordance with the schedule outlined, it is expected 
that 
examination of the materials on changing the enterprises 
stipulated by the RF President's Decree No. 1702 of 30 December 
1992 into joint-stock companies and their submission to the RF 
Ministry of Fuel and Energy will be completed for the most part 
in the third quarter of this year. 
<H6>  7. Conclusions </H6>
  7.1. The recession continues in coal mining, the production 
volumes at coal machinebuilding plants, and in capital 
construction. 
  These are the principal reasons: 
  --decline in the effective demand for coal products because 
of coal customers' lack of funds and the increased prices for 
coal; 
  --the shortage of funds to obtain materials and equipment in 
the quantities needed; and 
  --delays in receiving the means of state support. 
  7.2 Introduction of free prices for coal beginning on 1 July 
1993 with an increase in transportation rates at the same time 
has had a negative effect on the level of coal deliveries and 
its accumulation by customers before the fall and winter period 
of 1993-1994.
