  [Excerpt] Military chiefs will be appointed exclusively by 
politicians. The Council of Ministers today approved a bill, to 
be submitted to parliament, giving the government and the 
president of the Republic the power to appoint military chiefs. 
Lists of names chosen by the top brass of the three branches of 
the Armed Forces will disappear. The Ministry of Defense will 
make its choices and the president will sign the nominations.
