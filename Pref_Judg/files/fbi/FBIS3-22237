  [Text] The new building of the European Parliament in 
Brussels may have to be evacuated due to high concentrations of 
formaldehyde, a substance which is thought to be 
cancer-inducing. It is used in lining of conference halls and 
offices. Measurements have shown that the air inside the 
Parliament building contains three times more formaldehyde than 
the legal limit. The study dates from October and results were 
eventually disclosed by Paul Staes, a member of the European 
Parliament for the Flemish Green Party Agalev. New measurements 
were made last week and these have confirmed earlier findings. 
The air was analyzed after complaints from personnel at the 
European Parliament that they were getting headache and runny 
eyes inside the building. The air conditioning system is now 
working at all times in the building. 
  The problem at the European Parliament building is 
reminiscent of what happened to the headquarters of the European 
Commission in Brussels. That building was evacuated a number of 
years ago after asbestos levels were found to be dangerously 
high.
