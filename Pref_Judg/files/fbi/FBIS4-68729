"Democracy in Russia: A Lowering of Values"] 
  [Text] All of the 20th century in Russia has passed under 
the "sign of democracy," that is, in the struggle either for or 
against it. Paradoxically, what all of the country's leaders 
have in common, regardless of their real intentions, has been 
and still is an obvious indifference to the democratic 
phraseology: "popular rule," the rights and freedoms of the 
individual, etc. It is no accident that democratic rhetoric is 
to be found in almost equal measure in all Russian 
constitutions--from the "Leninist" one of 1918 up to the 
"Yeltsin" one. During the "Gorbachevian" and "Yeltsinian" 
periods the appeal to the values of democracy reached such force 
that there was hope for irreversibility of Russia's movement 
toward real democracy, toward real freedom. But recently the 
political expectations of citizens of postcommunist Russia have 
begun to assume an uncontrolled internal dynamic. "Flight from 
authoritarianism," it seems, is not happening. The political and 
economic reforms in Russia, which began in the name of 
democratic rights and freedoms, not only did not increase the 
significance of these "general human values" but even began to 
evoke an effect of rejection in the mass awareness. 
  An all-Russian public opinion poll we conducted in December 
1993 in all 12 economic regions of the country (a sampling of 
6,000 respondents) showed that the orientation of Russian voters 
toward the values of democracy and freedom of speech is 
appreciably "dying out." Five years ago it was expressed 
immeasurably more intensively and coincided with the "average" 
figures for the USSR (December 1988, the Union-wide poll with a 
sampling of 4,000 respondents). Here is how the responses to the 
following question were distributed (in percentages) then and 
now:

  Some people will look for the reason for these changes in 
the 
traditional Russian psychology, in the people, their 
"authoritarian past"; some people will look--in the objective 
circumstances, in the historical situation. Although both are 
right in their own way, it would be wrong to think that "an 
authoritarian fate" is hanging over Russia or that the present 
"psychological leaning" is fatal in nature. The problem is not 
with the people but with state policy, which influences the 
sociopsychological situation in society. 
  It is this policy that creates conditions so that, for 
example, one (political, moral, sociopsychological, etc.) type 
of individual succeeds in society, another--barely survives, and 
a third--dies out altogether. In other words, it is the state 
policy, its "successes-failures," that are frequently the 
generator of various social attitudes. 
  The all-Russian poll showed that in all regions of the 
country people are bothered most by problems of purely physical 
survival, particularly living conditions, the economic situation 
(65 percent), the condition of law and order and the fight 
against crime (57 percent), the ecological situation (26 
percent) and, to a lesser degree--the sociopolitical situation 
(8 percent) and the spiritual, moral-psychological situation (15 
percent). The social situation in the country has become fairly 
strained and many are not perceiving the changes that are taking 
place. To the question "can you say that now your time has 
come?" most of the population of the country who were 
questioned--79 percent--answered "no." 
  The type of individual produced by today's political and 
economic situation and the one that takes root in Russian 
society more and more successfully can be seen from the example 
of the dynamic of the mass awareness of Muscovites. A recent 
poll of the Institute of Sociology of Parliamentarianism (31 
March 1994) showed that even in the comparatively "democratic" 
Moscow there has been a marked rise of the level of 
sociopsychological intolerance of people with different views. 
Thus there has been an increase from 28 percent (May 1993) to 43 
percent (March 1994) of the number of people who think that not 
everyone in Russia (people, parties, movements, mass media) 
should have freedom of speech to an equal degree and another 2 
percent think that freedom of speech should be restricted for 
everyone, 13 percent "find it hard to answer," and only less 
than half of the Muscovites (42 percent) are convinced that 
"everyone should have freedom of speech to an equal degree." 
  Every fourth Muscovite exhibits religious intolerance as 
well: 21 percent think that "not all religions in Russia should 
enjoy equal rights" and another 4 percent suggest "limiting the 
rights of all religions." Moreover, every third respondent (32 
percent) thinks that the Russian mass media have too much 
freedom of speech (compare: in May 1993--22 percent) and that 
the Russian leaders should more strictly control the content of 
publications and materials of the domestic mass media (35 
percent). 
  Among certain people social intolerance is not limited to an 
aversion to freedom of speech but extends even to human rights: 
Only 68 percent think that "all citizens of Russia should have 
equal rights," 17 percent, on the contrary, think that "the 
rights of certain citizens should be restricted," and 15 percent 
find it difficult to determine their opinion. The 
"recommendations" of some of the respondents regarding "the 
signs according to which the rights of 'certain citizens' should 
be restricted" are curious: 7 percent of those questioned advise 
limiting rights "according to convictions, affiliation with 
parties and social organizations," 4 percent--"according to 
national and race indicators," 2 percent--"according to official 
position," 1 percent--"according to place of residence," 1 
percent--"according to property position," and 4 
percent--"according to other indicators." 
  To be fair, one must note that the negativism toward 
"others'" rights is strangely interwoven in the mass awareness 
with a surprisingly indifferent attitude toward their own 
rights. Thus 31 percent of Muscovites do not know their 
constitutional rights at all and 39 percent find it difficult to 
name specifically the rights and freedoms that are most 
important in their view. 
  At the same time many are aware that they are living in a 
nondemocratic world. Thus only 14 percent of Muscovites consider 
present-day Russia to be a democratic country (August 1992--21 
percent). And the majority--68 percent--consider present-day 
Russia an undemocratic country (August 1992--59 percent) and 18 
percent--find it "difficult to decide." Nonetheless, the 
"nondemocratism" of Russia perceived by many people is not 
causing mass protest. 
  With this level of knowledge of their constitutional rights 
and with this attitude toward the values of democracy, it is not 
surprising that 30 percent of Muscovites are prepared to 
"support a policy of improving social order and the standard of 
living in the country at the expense of restricting democratic 
freedoms," 28 percent--"find it difficult to determine" their 
position, and only 42 percent say "no" to such a turn of events.
