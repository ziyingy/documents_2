  [Text] Qingdao, April 8 (XINHUA) -- A scientific survey 
vessel staffed by 55 scientists and 52 crew members left here 
today for an eight-month mission to the central Pacific. 
  Its sophisticated seabed investigations will study 
polymetallic structure. 
  The 4,435-ton "Xiangyanghong 09" will survey a 65,000 sq km 
area to the southeast of Hawaii. 
  Scientists said that they will investigate water, climate 
environment, biological environment, hydro-chemical environment 
and the seabed landscape. 
  In addition, the mission will provide an opportunity for 
some 
foreign scientists to practise at sea. 
  The vessel, 15.20 meters wide and 112.9 meters long, has a 
maximum speed of 18.2 knots. It has completed several 
scientific missions since 1977. 
  Much sophisticated exploration and sample-collecting 
equipment was added to the ship before its departure, according 
to officials from the National Bureau of Oceanography.
