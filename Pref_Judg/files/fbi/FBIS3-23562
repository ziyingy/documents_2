under the rubric: "A View on the Problem": "Science Requires 
Money: An Axiom That Still Has To Be Argued in Russia"] 
  [Text] In the middle of November 1993, Russian 
Federation President B. Yeltsin conducted a conference on 
conversion issues in Tula where he announced his intention to 
increase the share of expenditures on NIOKR [scientific research 
and experimental design work] of defense NIIs [scientific 
research institutes] and KBs [design bureaus] by 10 percent in 
the 1994 military budget. At a 19 January 1994 Security Council 
session, he reaffirmed what he had said in Tula, emphasizing, in 
the process, the aspiration to bring NIOKR's share up to 15 
percent in the future. What caused these figures and what do 
they mean for science, the country's economy and its defense 
capability? 
  To explain this, let's recall that NIOKR -- scientific 
research and experimental design work -- is nothing other than 
the evolution of a scientist's or engineer-designer's idea that 
is designated by this abbreviation. Its diagram is well known: 
Fundamental science theoretically announces discoveries, 
research and inventions, the materialization of which in 
principle can be utilized directly in the development of 
weapons. This discovery needs confirmation. NIR --scientific 
research work -- or NIER -- scientific research and experimental 
work -- is designed for confirmation. With its favorable result, 
the process shifts to the next stage -- experimental design work 
(OKR), during the course of which a concrete model with assigned 
parameters is developed. Later, testing and, finally, series 
production follow. 
  Although this is also a simplified understanding of NIOKR, 
its essence is contained precisely in this. And also in the fact 
that its own category of work that needs financing corresponds 
to each stage of NIOKR. Basic and exploratory research, and also 
the development and improvement of experimental, technological 
and test range facilities occupy a special place among them 
because they are the foundation of foundations. Because 
exploration, progress, the development of an elementary base, 
and the prediction of development of some or other direction of 
research depends on their state. That is, the future depends on 
them.

  It is not unlike an axiom. It is known and followed 
throughout the world. By way of illustration, during the last 35 
years, the United States has been steadily allocating from 
35-45% of the resources allocated for all military 
R&amp;D for 
"basic research" and facilities. And even right now, when 
military expenditures are being substantially reduced and the 
American organs of state rule are accomplishing the task of 
changing the strategy of development of the national defense 
technological and industrial base, the overall principle of 
allocating resources remains unchanged. A preference is being 
assigned to the future -- to the development of defense 
technologies and next generation equipment. 
  In Russia, reduction of defense appropriations began in 
1988. 
Is it not paradoxical, with a reduction of budget expenditures 
for science? And first of all, for basic and exploratory 
research and for development of facilities. These expenditures 
were reduced by a factor of 2.5 in 1992 alone. The degradation 
of the research process that supports the development of the 
scientific-technical reserve makes an even bigger impression in 
a percentage ratio, from 10% in 1989 to 0.5% in 
1993. 
  This situation will result in entirely predictable 
consequences: In the near future, we will not be able to develop 
future weapons systems. We will not be able to, unless the state 
-- and today Russian science has no other customer or other 
source of financing, besides the state budget -- sends the 
required amount of resources for the conduct of basic and 
exploratory scientific research work, the development of high 
technologies and dual-use technologies, and the development of 
the scientific-technical reserve. 
  The question arises: What figure is being designated as the 
"required amount of resources"? We have already explained that 
the Americans spend up to 45% of R&amp;D money. Experts, 
specifically, Goskomoboronprom [State Committee for the Defense 
Industry] Main Administration for Scientific-Technical and 
Conversion Programs Deputy Chief Vladislav Fadeyev, assert that 
our expenditures should not be lower than 30%. All the 
more so 
right now when the budget has not been executed for three years 
(1991-1993) and we have significantly lagged behind. We have 
begun to lag behind ourselves. 
  It remains to determine the starting point: How much does 
all 
NIOKR cost? One thing is required to do this -- to observe the 
proper rules. The main rule consists of the fact that the 
development cycle for one model of military equipment or weapon 
totals 10-15 years, from the idea to series production. This 
standard has been acceptable for everyone, not only for Russia. 
So, in order to fit into the time periods, it is necessary to 
invest no less than 14-15% of the project's cost annually 
into 
the development. World experience confirms this. Only in this 
manner is it possible to approach 80% readiness of the 
model in 
5-6 years and to become convinced that it will be developed. 
  The Americans finance their R&amp;D while proceeding 
precisely 
from these proportions. In their country, science accounts on 
average for 15% of the ratio of military expenditures. It 
was 
approximately the same in our country, until 1988. Later the 
reduction occurred. And in 1993, this figure fell below the 
3% 
mark. (Now, imagine what kind of small change basic science and 
facilities raked in if their share totaled less than 1% 
of that 
3%). 
  As Vladislav Fadeyev says, "In general we can also work in 
that 3%. Only then developments will be prolonged to 25-30 
years. But that is absurd." In other words, it is a utopian task 
to develop future weapons and also dual purpose future 
technologies. The requirements of the military doctrine and the 
weapons program that have been calculated until the year 2000, 
the realization of which has been approved, will not withstand 
any criticism in this case. 
  Based upon the assessments of Western specialists and 
experts, specifically, from the Pentagon, the former USSR, being 
a mighty power in a military sense, lagged behind the United 
States in 17 of 31 primary types of weapons based upon their 
technical level. In the future, the technical lag in this sphere 
can reach a critical point, after which Russia will be compelled 
to purchase high-tech weapons abroad in order to have a 
well-equipped army. 
  Based upon the assessments of our own scientists, we are at 
the level of the United States in only 6-7 of 21 key 
technologies. Unfortunately, this gap has also been increasing 
in recent years. 
  Today, expenditures on R&amp;D are increasing in all 
countries 
and especially intensively for the Germans, Japanese, and 
Chinese. All of them are taking advantage of the opportunity and 
are attempting to leave Russia behind. In the United States, 
expenditures have increased from $13.1 billion in 1980 to $37.8 
billion in 1992. Today, the United States government annually 
spends $76 billion on all science, of that 60% is for 
purely 
military programs. In the process, President Clinton says that 
from now on he will view support of multi-profile industrial 
technologies as a priority task. "Financing must be reviewed so 
that more resources are allocated for critically important 
technologies such as future materials, information technology, 
and new production processes that will permit us to improve 
industrial parameters". 
  That is why it was necessary to resolve the problem of 
financing science to ensure we eliminate our lagging behind 
which is already a fact. And although a 10% infusion is 
only 
capable of temporarily easing the situation (and this is still 
unknown because the 1994 budget has not yet been approved and 
they only recently began to repay the state's debts for defense 
order-93, meaning that we have already picked the pocket of our 
own pants which have still not been sewn), that very fact is 
important. All the more so that it gives us hope that all is not 
yet lost.
