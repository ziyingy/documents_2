Zemin sent a salute today to Chinese and foreign expeditions to 
Antarctica on the occasion of the winter solstice festival which 
will fall on Tuesday [21 June] in the southern hemisphere. 
  Jiang sent the cable message to mark the tenth anniversary 
of 
China's sending independent expeditions to Antarctica. 
  Following is the full text of Jiang's cable message: 
  "At the time when you are celebrating the winter solstice 
festival, I, on behalf of the Chinese Government and the Chinese 
people and in the name of myself, extend cordial regards for you 
scientists, engineers and other technical personnel working 
selflessly in the long polar night. I wish you a happy winter 
solstice festival. 
  "Antarctica is the last continent on earth that still 
remains 
desolate and wild. Holding high the banner of peace, 
cooperation and friendship, you are fighting against the wind, 
snow and cold and have made constant progress in the scientific 
expedition, thus making great contributions to exposing the 
secret of Antarctica, safeguarding the global ecological 
environment and promoting the common prosperity and progress of 
human society. 
  "Let me take this opportunity to salute expeditions from all 
countries who have contributed to probing into, studying and 
protecting Antarctica. 
  "The 1.1 billion Chinese people congratulate you for the 
abundant achievements you have already made and are looking 
forward to the even greater contributions you will make to 
peaceful utilization of Antarctica. 
  "May the winter go well for you and I wish you success in 
your work."
