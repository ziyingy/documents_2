  [Text] The main responsibility for the quality control of 
many industrial products is shifting away from the central 
government and more towards the enterprises themselves, as they 
increasingly hold their products up to international standards 
to compete in the market economy. 
  As part of this trend, the State Technical Supervision 
Bureau 
is lifting the requirement for production permits on 102 
categories of products beginning next month. This follows the 
move last June to abolish the permit requirement for an initial 
103 categories. 
  The production permit system was introduced 10 years ago to 
control the quality of industrial products. The manufacture of 
some 500 types of products has been placed under this form of 
State regulation. 
  "This is a move taken by the State to serve the development 
of the country's market economy and concentrate attention on the 
quality control of the most important products," said an 
official with the bureau, which is in charge of the country's 
quality control work. 
  By scaling back the system, the official explained, 
oversight 
can be even more effective for the remaining products that still 
require production permits. "Production permit control will be 
strictly imposed on those products which concern people's health 
and the safety of life and property," the official said. 
  For instance, the permit control imposed since 1990 on the 
production of disposable syringes, will continue. The poor 
quality of the syringes had caused widespread complaints, and 
the permit, system has improved the product's qualifying rate 
from 48 per cent to 89 per cent over the past four years, the 
official said.
