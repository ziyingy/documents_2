<F P=106> [Interview with Ulrich Maurer, Social Democratic Party of </F>
Germany, SPD chief Rudolf Scharping's political spokesman, by 
Wulf Reimer; place and date not given: "The Debate On 10 Or 30 
Grams Of Drugs Is Relatively Absurd"] 
  [Text] [SUEDDEUTSCHE ZEITUNG] Mr. Maurer, the 
Constitutional Court ruling on drugs has created more confusion 
than understanding, including, it would seem, inside the SPD 
[Social Democratic Party of Germany]. 
  [Maurer] Yes. We have had a somewhat incohesive debate over 
the past few weeks, a debate that I fail to understand. The 
conclusions we reached at our party congress in November 1993 
are clear. 
  [SUEDDEUTSCHE ZEITUNG] People in your party have been upset 
even more by Duesseldorf Justice Minister Krumsiek's pledge that 
the possession of up to 10 grams of hashish and as much as 0.5 
grams of heroin would be permitted by law. 
  [Maurer] I fail to understand this move. We agreed on the 
application of the opportunity principle, whereby, as far as 
hard drugs are concerned, each individual case should be 
assessed according to its merits. In addition, I believe that a 
controlled dosage of opiates can only be tolerated in the case 
of medical treatment. Were we to permit the use of hard drugs 
even in non- medical cases, we would open all the floodgates. 
  [SUEDDEUTSCHE ZEITUNG] Why is the SPD incapable of 
introducing uniform rules on drugs, at least in the laender it 
controls? 
  [Maurer] The party's resolutions are clear. Since 
Wiesbaden, we have been in favor of legalizing the consumption 
of cannabis products. But the situation is quite different with 
dealers. In this case I insist on tough penalties. 
  [SUEDDEUTSCHE ZEITUNG] Are you in favor of an exact 
definition of the meaning of a "reasonable quantity" of "soft" 
drugs? Stuttgart Minister President Erwin Teugel thinks it is 
not necessary. 
  [Maurer] We are determined to adhere to the rulings of the 
supreme German court, whereby first of all the laender must 
reach agreement at justice minister level on a joint legal 
policy, and later reach a similar agreement at minister 
president level. This is of course only possible when one has 
first of all decided what exactly constitutes a small amount of 
drugs. 
  [SUEDDEUTSCHE ZEITUNG] But what does the SPD consider to be 
an acceptable maximum amount? 
  [Maurer] Right now I consider a debate on 10 or 30 grams of 
drugs rather absurd. I think one should accept the opinion of 
experienced drug therapists. Apart from that, I did not wish to 
forestall consultations by the relevant ministers. Even so, one 
will have to reach an agreement on a common line, or else one 
will not be able to implement the rulings of the Constitutional 
Court. 
  [SUEDDEUTSCHE ZEITUNG] What will the SPD do to free the 
police from the unbearable situation of no longer having to 
punish people for possessing and using drugs because the state 
prosecution will frequently waive criminal proceedings? 
  [Maurer] That is the scandal right now. We are tying down 
enormous police forces that we would otherwise use to combat 
dealers and drug criminals. The legality principle has so far 
been compelling policemen to draw up copious reports and 
protocols that the state prosecutions, even in 
Christian-Democratic Union laender, have subsequently thrown 
into the waste paper basket. In future, the police should 
concentrate on the dealers and especially on the structure of 
organized crime. The police must have the possibility of 
referring drug addicts directly to treatment centers. In this 
way, hard-drug consumers could be rescued from the world of 
crime and from the compulsion of street prostitution. They 
could be rescued from a miserable life that causes great social 
damage. 
  [SUEDDEUTSCHE ZEITUNG] Then the police no longer has to 
bother with "junkies"? 
  [Maurer] If we establish a common policy on soft drugs in 
accordance with the Constitutional Court ruling, it will be 
clear to the police that it will no longer have to bother with 
drugs. As for punishment for the consumption of hard drugs, I 
think one should apply the opportunity principle. The police, 
together with state prosecutions, must decide whether or not a 
case, for example one involving dealers, should be closely 
investigated, or, to give another example, whether or not one is 
dealing with an addict who needs treatment.
