  [Abstract] The ultrasensitive laser atomic fluorescence 
spectroscopy (LAFS) method was used in direct determination of 
the content of Pb, Cd and Bi in samples of deep layers of ice 
from Antarctica and Greenland. The work was done in 
collaboration with French scientists from the LGGE at Grenoble. 
The LAFAS-1 spectrometer, in which the source of resonance 
radiation is a dye laser excited by the radiation of an excimer 
XeCl laser, was used. The spectrometer is fully described in the 
literature and briefly in this article. The sampling method and 
method for preparing the samples are described in detail. Ice 
cylinders 6-10 cm in diameter and 15-30 cm high were extracted. 
There was excellent agreement between the results of Pb and Cd 
measurements made by the LAFS method and the two classical 
methods. However, the sensitivity of the LAFS method is several 
orders of magnitude greater than the other methods. With the 
LAFAS-1 all three elements were measured with sample volumes 
20æm (Pb) and 50 æm (Cd, Bi). In the traditional method a 
much longer time was required in the sampling and the samples 
had to be much larger. There are three principal sources of 
entry of heavy metals into the atmosphere: wind erosion of the 
soil surface, volcanic ejecta and microspray from the ocean 
surface. The contribution of different sources is examined in 
detail in the example of Pb. Figures 2; references 21: 20
