  [Text] Moscow April 25 TASS -- Preliminary marine pollution 
measurements taken from the sites of radioactive waste dumping 
by the former Soviet Union and Japan in the Sea of Japan did not 
reveal any Cesium-137 radioactive level fluctuations. These 
preliminary conclusions were reached at the end of the joint 
Russian-Japanese-South Korean expedition's first stage, which 
was undertaken with the participation of IAEA (International 
Atomic Energy Agency) specailists from March 18 to April 15. 
  The Russian Navy press centre told ITAR-TASS that the tests 
were conducted on board the Russian hydrometeorological 
scientific reasearch ship "Okean" (ocean). The expedition 
helped obtain information about the real radioactivity and 
ecological situation in the areas of radioactive waste dumping 
by the navy of the former Soviet Union and Russia. 
  Detailed analyses of sea water samples, sea bottom 
sediments, 
animal plankton and organisms living on the sea bottom, will be 
carried out in laboratories of Russia, Japan, South Korea and 
IAEA and published as a complete report within one year at the 
end of the expedition.
