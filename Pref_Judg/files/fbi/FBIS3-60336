  [Text] In accordance with a directive from the 
Government of the Russian Federation, the Russian Ministry of 
Environmental Protection and Natural Resources has in 
conjunction with other affected ministries and agencies prepared 
and submitted for the government's consideration a draft 
``National Plan of Action To Implement the Decisions of the UN 
Conference on the Environment and Development'' (Rio de Janeiro, 
1992). As additional work is done on this draft, consideration 
will be given to the results of the Europe-wide conference 
entitled ``The Environment for Europe,'' held in Switzerland in 
1993. 
  The draft document that we propose to discuss in the pages 
of 
ZELENYY MIR has been considered and approved by an interagency 
commission established in accordance with the government's 
directive. 
<H5>  I. Conceptual Foundations </H5>
  The National Plan To Implement the Decisions of the UN 
Conference on the Environment and Development (subsequently to 
be referred to as ``the National Plan'') was developed for the 
purpose of providing a basis for urgent measures and basic goals 
with regard to ensuring environmental safety and restoring the 
environment. 
  This document is based on the Russian Federation law ``On 
Environmental Protection,'' decrees issued by the Government of 
the Russian Federation, decisions by the UN Conference on the 
Environment and Development (June 1992, Rio de Janeiro, Brazil), 
the Lucerne Conference on a Program of Action To Protect the 
Environment of Central and Eastern Europe (April 1993, 
Switzerland) and the board of the Russian Ministry of Ecology 
[as published] in regard to priority areas requiring program 
development in the field of environmental protection, and 
statements contained in the Russian Federation's State 
Environmental Program. 
  The National Plan is a foundation for Russia's actions in 
regard to the environment and development. 
  It is essential to be guided by the following key 
principles: 
  -- consideration for environmental and development issues in 
the process of political and economic decisionmaking; 
  -- compliance with the requirements of environmental 
protection legislation and environmental standards; 
  -- compliance with the terms of environmental protection 
when 
implementing reforms designed to bring about sustainable 
economic development; 
  -- use of economic means to compensate for losses due to 
environmental pollution; 
  -- reduction of risks to public health resulting from 
pollution and the harmful effect of the environment, including 
air pollution in cities and buildings, water pollution, the 
problems of pesticides, wastes, noise, and ionizing and 
nonionizing radiation, coupled with creation of a system for 
monitoring the state of the environment and assessing its 
quality and the state of public health; 
  -- protection of the environment and natural resources with 
consideration for the maintenance of the distinctiveness, 
culture, and interests of native people and guarantees of their 
effective participation in the achievement of sustainable 
development; 
  -- further development of international cooperation for the 
purpose of preserving, protecting, and restoring the integrity 
of the Earth's ecosystems; 
  -- improvement of international legal relations pertaining 
to 
liability and compensation for the negative effects of 
environmental damage. 
  These principles will make it possible, despite a lack of 
funding and the state of existing economic relationships, to 
establish priorities among environmental problems when federal 
and regional program materials are compiled as components of the 
national plan of action. 
  The National Plan envisions a transition period during which 
gradual changes in the economic mechanism will be used to bring 
about adaptation to market relationships, as well as a gradual 
transition from strictly regulated, centrally planned management 
of natural resource use to a decentralized system of regional 
management. 
<H3>  Section 1. Development of a System for the Management of 
Natural Resource Use and Environmental Protection </H3>
  In recent decades the worsening state of the environment has 
begun to cause a real decline in people's standard of living and 
to limit opportunities for the economic and social development 
of major industrial regions and cities. More than 80 percent of 
the resources produced are expended to support 
resource-extracting and resource-intensive processing 
facilities: Smelting one tonne of steel ``consumes'' up to 20 
tonnes of primary resources (including mine overburden and 
enclosing deposits). More than 75 percent of all production 
wastes are to varying degrees toxic to the environment and human 
health. The wasteful and destructive nature of natural resource 
use is constantly giving rise to new and ever more acute 
environmental problems. 
  The worsening of the environmental situation is the result 
of 
structural deformations of the economy that have accumulated 
over a period of many decades and have resulted in the 
predominance of nature-intensive industries, outdated 
resource-intensive and energy-intensive technologies, a raw 
materials emphasis in exports, and inadequately focused efforts 
in recent years to prevent the harmful effects of commercial and 
other activities on human beings and the environment. 
  The beginning of radical economic reform made the issue of a 
changing role for the ecological factor in society's development 
more urgent. There is now a serious threat of a worsening 
environmental situation due to: 
  -- disruption of commercial relations, disruption of planned 
operating systems, and higher levels of production-related 
accidents; 
  -- enterprises' financial difficulties, which limit their 
ability to carry out environmental protection measures; 
  -- inadequate budget allocations to sectors responsible for 
the reproduction and protection of natural resources (forestry 
and water resource agencies, geological surveys and 
environmental protection agencies); 
  -- the lack of legislative restrictions on the powers and 
responsibility of organs of government and administration along 
vertical and horizontal lines, which leads to a lack of 
coordination in measures taken in the field of natural resource 
use and environmental safety, to irresponsible actions with 
regard to the disposition of natural resources, and to their de 
facto plundering. 
  The environmental situation can be stabilized and improved 
only through a change in the orientation of the Russian 
Federation's socioeconomic development, a formation of new 
values and moral guideposts, and a reconsideration of the 
structure of needs, goals, priorities, and means involved in 
human activity. This will require a complex of radical 
political, legislative, socioeconomic, technological, and other 
measures. Furthermore, the principle of reasonable compromise 
must be applied when resolving conflicts that arise between the 
need to abide by environmental regulations and restrictions and 
the economic motivation of commercial activity. 
  Thus, it is essential that a state policy be 
developed in the field of natural resource use and environmental 
protection. 
  The most important focus of state environmental policy is 
the 
creation of a new legal and economic mechanism to regulate 
interaction between state organs at various levels and natural 
resource users, and the inclusion of environmental requirements 
in the procedure for assessing the socioeconomic effectiveness 
of the administrative decisions that are made. 
  The nature of these transformations is: 
  -- improvement of environmental protection legislation, the 
system of environmental restrictions and regulations, and 
natural resource use regulations, with the goal of adapting them 
to the situation of price liberalization and destatization of 
property; 
  -- a gradual transition to international standards for 
technological processes and products that will create the 
essential conditions for Russia's inclusion in the world economy 
and the international environmental safety system; 
  -- unification of departmental systems for observation and 
monitoring of the state of natural resources and environmental 
sites that currently exist in the regions under unified 
methodological and organizational leadership; 
  -- economic incentives for resource and energy conservation 
and introduction of equipment and technology that meet 
environmental requirements, by means of state tax, lending, and 
price policies; 
  -- environmental assessment and evaluation of environmental 
impact during implementation of all programs and projects of a 
commercial or other nature; 
  -- creation of topical environmental maps, regional 
cadastral 
maps of natural resources, and geo-information systems using a 
unified digital topographic base; 
  -- creation of an environmentally oriented job market and 
development of enterprise in that field. 
  These transformations should lay the groundwork for the 
stabilization and subsequent improvement of the environmental 
situation in Russia. 
  Under conditions of price liberalization--including prices 
for fuel and energy resources--state environmental safety 
regulatory measures are an important factor in stimulating more 
efficient use of energy and mineral and water resources and 
reducing pollution of the air and water. Consideration for the 
real cost of resources will force a transition away from the 
practice of large-scale capital investment connected with heavy 
industrial production toward an ongoing process of replacement 
of existing capital equipment and introduction of new 
technologies, resulting in a reduction in the average amount of 
pollution per product unit. 
<H6>  1.1. Legislation and the Mechanism of Legal Standards </H6>
  Legal support for the National Plan will have as its goal 
the 
development of a scientifically based system of environmental 
legislation and the creation of an effective mechanism for its 
implementation for the purpose of protecting the environment, 
organizing rational natural resource use and creating an 
all-encompassing environmental safety system. 
  Existing environmental legal acts and the mechanism by which 
they are applied should be based on a harmonious combination of 
economic and environmental interests, with constant priority 
given to human beings' rights to a healthy environment and 
favorable living conditions, and to preservation of the 
biosphere's sustainable ecosystems. 
  In view of active entrepreneurial activity and the 
transition 
to a market economy, no legislative acts should be adopted that 
do not reflect environmental requirements. 
  In 1993-1994 a scientifically based system of environmental 
legislation should be created, and in the process it is 
essential that a whole series of fundamental legal acts be 
adopted: 
  1. in regard to matters under the jurisdiction of federal 
organs of state authority and organs of authority under the 
components of the Federation--the Fundamentals of Russian 
Federation Legislation on Environmental Protection and 
Regulation of Natural Resource Use; the Fundamentals of 
Legislation on Environmental Safety in Russia; the Fundamentals 
of Russian Federation Land, Forest, and Water Legislation; the 
Fundamentals of Legislation on Underground Resources; the 
Fundamentals of Legislation on Protection of the Atmosphere; the 
Fundamentals of Legislation on Flora; the Fundamentals of 
Legislation on Fauna; and the Fundamentals of Legislation on 
Specially Protected Natural Areas; 
  2. in regard to matters under the sole jurisdiction of 
Russian Federation federal organs of state authority--the 
Russian Federation laws ``On Protection of Public Health and the 
Environment During the Production, Use, Storage, and 
Transportation of Pesticides, Chemical Fertilizers, and Other 
Agricultural Chemicals,'' ``On the Continental Shelf of the 
Russian Federation,'' ``On the Exclusive Economic Zone of the 
Russian Federation,'' ``On Lake Baykal,'' ``On Production and 
Consumption Wastes,'' ``On Public Radiation Safety,'' ``On State 
Policy in the Area of Radioactive Waste Handling,'' ``On 
Environmental Assessment,'' ``On Environmental Monitoring,'' 
``On the Economic Mechanism of Natural Resource Use,'' ``On 
Measures To Provide Legal and Social Protection for Employees of 
Specially Authorized Russian Federation Agencies in the Field of 
Environmental Protection.'' 
  Additionally, it is essential to introduce environmentally 
oriented changes and additions to existing laws such as the 
Russian Federation law issued on 4 June 1991 and entitled ``On 
Foreign Investment in the Russian Federation,'' the Russian 
Federation Civil Procedural Code, the Russian Federation Code of 
Administrative Legal Violations, the Russian Federation Criminal 
Code, and the Russian Federation Civil Code. 
  The following should also be drawn up, in addition to the 
aforementioned legislative acts: 
  -- normative acts establishing a procedure for application 
of 
civil penalties for violations of environmental legislation; 
  -- a procedure for suspending or terminating the operations 
of associations, enterprises, and organizations that violate the 
environmental requirements of legislation (suspension of 
operations by individual units of equipment or assemblies, or 
individual types of work) and compensation for damages done to 
the environment; 
  -- a procedure for appealing decisions by executive bodies 
in 
the area of environmental protection and natural resources; 
  -- a procedure for preparation of the documents necessary to 
pursue criminal prosecution; 
  -- a procedure for collecting payments for natural resource 
use and environmental pollution; 
  -- a procedure for delineating the authority of 
environmental 
management organs. 
<H6>  1.2. Economic Regulation of Natural Resource Use </H6>
  The nature and scale of improvement in the environmental 
situation expected as a result of the implementation of economic 
reform may vary significantly depending on the nature of the 
environment and the pollutants in question. The market economy 
is not a panacea. In those cases in which it does not work, an 
energetic environmental protection policy is needed, 
particularly when expenses in connection with damage done to the 
environment as a result of which individual people or 
communities suffer are not compensated for by those responsible 
for the damage. Some of these measures could be aimed at 
adjusting market stimuli (for example, by forcing polluters to 
pay a fine as compensation for damage caused as a result of the 
emission or discharge of pollutants), while others could suspend 
the operation of the market mechanism by imposing limits on 
emissions or discharges and on natural resource use. 
  At the present stage of economic reform (1993-95), it is 
essential to use to maximum effect those levers and stimuli with 
the aid of which it is possible to utilize untapped resources to 
improve the environmental situation in the country without 
incurring significant expenditures. 
  Toward that end it is essential: 
  -- to improve the mechanism of payments for pollutant 
emissions and discharges, develop and introduce into practice 
standard payments as compensation for damages resulting from 
various types of adverse effects on the environment 
(noise-related, thermal, electromagnetic, radioactive, and so 
on); 
  -- to develop an economic mechanism for accounting between 
the individual regions of the Russian Federation and various 
states for damages caused to the environment by cross-border 
dispersal of pollutants; 
  -- to develop and introduce into practice a system of 
regional cadastral maps of natural resources, including 
estimates of the value thereof; 
  -- to carry out measures to develop and support 
environmental 
enterprise and improve legislation in order to develop an 
environmental services market; 
  -- to create a system of environmental restrictions and 
regulations governing natural resource use; 
  -- to develop ecological economic assessments at the stages 
of projection, planning, pre-project, developmental, and other 
economic decisions; 
  -- to provide tax breaks for that portion of enterprises' 
profits set aside for environmental protection measures; 
  -- to create a state order system to implement environmental 
protection measures in environmental disaster areas and in areas 
with acute environmental situations; 
  -- to attract foreign capital on favorable terms in order to 
make additional financing available for environmental protection 
measures; 
  -- to create a market trading in the rights to discharge 
pollutants into the environment within established limits; 
  -- to develop progressive standards for maximum permissible 
emissions (discharges) of pollutants for basic technologies and 
types of production; 
  -- to establish a special tax rate for products manufactured 
using environmentally hazardous technologies; 
  -- to create a multilevel system of environmental protection 
insurance funds to finance the prevention and elimination of 
environmental effects from major accidents and human-caused or 
natural disasters; 
  -- to apply lending on favorable terms and subsidies for 
enterprises that effectively implement environmental program 
goals; 
  -- to improve the search for new basic approaches to the 
economic management of environmental protection activity (the 
environmental price of production and environmentally based 
economic calculations of production efficiency); 
  -- to expand the special-rate (lending) form of financing 
for 
environmental efforts out of local, oblast, kray, republic, and 
Russian Federation environmental funds. 
  Federal administrative bodies in conjunction with republic, 
kray, and oblast administrative bodies will define key regions 
in which to conduct experiments to develop new elements in the 
economic regulation of natural resource use, arrange scientific 
support for that work with funding from the Russian 
Environmental Fund, disseminate the experience gathered in these 
key regions, and ensure broad study and consultation by 
specialists from other regions of the Russian Federation. 
<H6>  1.3. The Public Health-Related, Demographic, and Ethnic 
Aspects of Natural Resource Use </H6>
  Without exception, all efforts to ensure environmental 
safety 
set forth in the National Plan and all measures to develop a 
system of natural resource use and environmental protection 
administration and to encourage environmental training and 
education must to one degree or another guarantee the health of 
individuals and society. 
  One priority issue is the deterioration of health as a 
result 
of a poor-quality environment. A threat to human health (and to 
the economy) is posed by the following types of pollutants: 
  -- lead contained in the air and in soil, with its source 
being zinc and lead smelters and vehicles; 
  -- airborne dust from household furnaces, small enterprises, 
electric and heat generating plants, large metallurgical plants, 
and other plants; 
  -- sulfur dioxide and other gases, particularly in 
combination with dust. 
  Other sources of health hazard are: 
  -- nitrates dissolved in water as a result of inadequate 
planning of feed storage facilities and other agricultural 
facilities and settling ponds in rural areas, and from improper 
fertilizer use; 
  -- pollutants in food and water, particularly in cases of 
the 
direct presence of heavy metals or toxic chemicals in drinking 
water reservoirs or the improper disposal of toxic nuclear 
wastes. 
  In addition, it is essential that provision also be made for 
the following measures: 
  -- to establish criteria for and identify zones and sites 
that are sources of increased environmental hazard and that 
directly affect human health; 
  -- to create a system of environmental medical monitoring by 
pooling the efforts and funds of agencies under the Russian 
State Committee for Sanitary and Epidemiological Oversight, the 
Russian Ministry of Health, the Russian Ministry of 
Environmental Protection and Natural Resources, local soviets, 
and other affected institutions, enterprises, and organizations. 
The Government of the Russian Federation will consider the 
possibility of additional allocations for these purposes; 
  -- to carry out environmental hygiene mapping of all of 
Russia; 
  -- to continue development of a system to track public 
health 
indicators and pinpoint factors negatively affecting the 
environment, taking into consideration the indirect and combined 
effects of various factors on public health; 
  -- to draw up an inventory and ranking of facilities in the 
economy that are hazardous to human health during normal 
operations and in the event of accidental emissions (or 
discharges); 
  -- to begin gradual introduction of a special natural 
resource use system within areas inhabited by or used 
economically by small peoples and ethnic groups in order to 
preserve their traditional natural resource use and cultural and 
economic ways of life. 
<H6>  1.4. State Environmental Assessment </H6>
  In order to ensure the effectiveness of State Environmental 
Assessment and improve its effectiveness during the 1993-95 
period, it is essential: 
  -- to pass a law on environmental assessment that will 
define 
the legal status of State Environmental Assessment and provide 
legal support for decisions made by State Environmental 
Assessment; 
  -- to adopt a statute on State Environmental Assessment on 
Russian territory; 
  -- to improve the existing system of funding for 
environmental assessment centrally and locally; to adopt a new 
procedure for payment to nonstaff experts and members of the 
Council on State Environmental Assessment, and make provision 
for significant recruitment of highly qualified specialists to 
work in the system of environmental assessment agencies; 
  -- to adopt a statute on payment of nonstaff experts and 
members of the Expert Council; 
  -- to clearly delineate the functions of subunits within the 
State Environmental Assessment of the Russian Ministry of 
Natural Resources and Environmental Protection, and in other 
agencies; 
  -- to develop an automated system of state environmental 
assessment; 
  -- to develop a system of geo-information support for the 
State Environmental Assessment system; 
  -- to develop a system of experts to define environmental 
disaster areas on the basis of regional categorization; 
  -- to develop guidelines for the conducting of medical 
environmental assessments; 
  -- to develop methodologies for tracking the state of the 
geological environment when environmental assessments are 
conducted; 
  -- to develop methodologies for monitoring the biological 
indices of industrial pollution; 
  -- to develop methodological recommendations to determine 
the 
degree of economic risk involved in various types of commercial 
activity; 
  -- to develop criteria by which to assess the ecological 
condition of the environment in regions with a high level of 
technogenic burden; 
  -- to develop a draft normative and organizational basis for 
interaction between the systems of Federal Geo-Ecological 
Monitoring and state environmental assessment; 
  -- to develop a draft and a working model of a system of 
geo-information support for the procedure of state environmental 
assessment; 
  -- in order to improve the training of employees of the 
Russian State Environmental Assessment system, to make provision 
for their focused training according to a special program and a 
single methodology; 
  -- to develop a methodological basis and a working model of 
an automated State Environmental Assessment work station; 
  -- to make provision for the establishment of temporary 
research teams on a cost-accounting basis, to develop normative 
and methodological documents regulating the operations of bodies 
of experts, requirements of planning documents, with 
consideration for scientific and technical advances, and 
promising objectives in the socioeconomic development of the 
republic and individual regions of Russia; 
  -- to reinforce the physical and technical infrastructure 
and 
create a testing laboratory (both stationary and mobile) in 
which to conduct control analyses as part of the assessment 
process and a data bank on nonstaff experts, scientific 
collectives, environmentally clean technologies, equipment, and 
so on. 
<H6>  1.5. The Federal System of Environmental Monitoring and 
Information Support for It </H6>
  At the present time a large portion of the information 
regarding the state of the environment and sources of adverse 
effects is scattered among agencies, has varying degrees of 
accuracy and quality, was collected and compiled for various 
purposes, and often either does not cover an issue in its 
entirety or is not reliable. 
  In the 1993-94 period, the main focuses of improvement in 
state environmental monitoring are: 
  -- development and approval of a ``Statute on Monitoring of 
Environmental Protection and Natural Resource Use''; 
  -- development and practical application of a unified system 
of standardization and methodological support for the operations 
of state monitoring agencies in the fields of ecology and 
natural resource use; 
  -- development of a draft program for a unified state system 
to monitor the state of the environment using state and 
departmental systems, as well as efforts to guarantee their 
methodological, metrical, informational, and organizational 
compatibility; 
  -- creation of the first stage of a system for quick 
determination and analysis of causes and projection of the 
effects of emergency situations in connection with accidental 
environmental pollution; creation of systems for emergency 
warnings concerning discharges into the environment and 
automated monitoring of emissions at enterprises with an 
elevated risk of creating pollution by toxic chemical and 
radioactive substances; 
  -- implementation of comprehensive development of issues 
pertaining to the creation of an observation network at sites 
where hazardous chemical and radioactive substances are buried, 
and an inventory and comprehensive study of the environment at 
places where they are stored or buried; 
  -- creation of a network of stationary and mobile equipment 
to monitor pollution sources, including through the use of 
long-range and quick-measurement methods; 
  -- creation and support for the effective operations of a 
system of state monitoring of the protection and efficient use 
of natural resources based on interaction between all monitoring 
and inspection services in that field; 
  -- creation of a system to monitor the radiological 
situation 
in areas subjected to radioactive contamination as a result of 
the accident at the Chernobyl nuclear power station, as well as 
in areas where nuclear industry and nuclear test sites are 
located; 
  -- implementation of technical refitting of the network for 
observation and monitoring; development and organization of 
serial production of measuring devices and auxiliary equipment 
and materials; 
  -- oversight of development of the manufacture of modern 
monitoring and measurement equipment and provision of that 
equipment to the appropriate services of environmental 
protection agencies; 
  -- oversight of the development, review, and establishment 
of 
pollution standards and issuance of licenses permitting 
pollutant emissions and discharges or natural resource use; 
  -- development of a procedure for suspending or terminating 
production activities by enterprises (or other production 
facilities) for environmental reasons; 
  -- performance of an analysis of existing standards 
governing 
the quality of natural sites, for the purpose of assessing their 
ecological and physical-chemical justification and developing a 
republic system of standards as the first stage in a transition 
to the establishment of environmental standards. 
  By 1995, there are plans to set up a State Information 
System 
(GIS) to gather, store, systemize, and process Russia's 
environmental information, for the purpose of achieving the 
following goals: 
  -- creation and maintenance of a data base on the state of 
the environment; innovative environment-protecting and 
resource-conserving technological, technical, organizational, 
and economic solutions; 
  -- creation of regularly updated environmental maps of 
Russia 
and individual regions; 
  -- maintenance of cadastral maps of natural resources; 
  -- projection of ecological situations within the country's 
territory; 
  -- tracking of environmental ratings issued to enterprises 
and regions; 
  -- development and improvement of the system for exchange of 
scientific and technical information about environmental 
protection with appropriate international, republic, and 
industry information agencies; 
  -- provision of up-to-date, complete, and reliable 
information on the state of the environment to organs of state 
administration, scientific and public organizations, and the 
public; 
  -- creation of a system to monitor the quality of data at 
all 
stages of their receipt, processing, compilation, and 
publication, and provision of that system with all necessary 
means and materials. 
  Geographical information and cartographic support should be 
organized on two levels: regional (republic, kray, oblast, and 
so on) and federal. The territorial correlation of this 
information (through aerial photographs or cartographical data, 
statistical reports, and so on) at each of these two levels will 
be provided with the help of the appropriate regional 
information elements. This sort of spatial correlation of 
information for the GIS will make it possible to begin 
establishing the GIS at the federal and regional levels 
simultaneously. 
  At the regional level, efforts to organize information 
support will require above all the creation of GIS's in the key 
regions (republics, krays, and oblasts). In the early stages, 
these will be oriented toward use in the study of specific areas 
and influence on them by commercial operations, and later (as 
information accumulates in the GIS) toward development of a 
mechanism to manage natural resource use in the region and a 
mechanism for interaction between GIS's at the regional and 
federal levels. 
  It is essential to create a central automated information 
and 
measurement system to monitor the environment and industrial 
emissions in one of Russia's industrially developed regions with 
an acute environmental situation, with subsequent use of 
experience with setting up that central automated system to 
develop an automated monitoring network for all of Russia. 
  The key goals that will be sequentially achieved in the 
process of establishing the GIS in 1993-94 will be: 
  a) at the regional level: 
  -- development of a conceptual model of the natural and 
economic complex in a base region; 
  -- selection and adaptation of GIS software; 
  -- determination of the basic and supplementary arrays of 
information modules for the GIS; 
  -- development of a system of regional information elements 
(TEI) in the base region; 
  -- development of a structure for the data base and 
selection 
of instruments for its implementation; 
  -- determination of the content of overview and 
overview-thematic maps; 
  -- development of data base structures for the basic array 
of 
information modules; 
  -- creation of a digital map and a section thereof for the 
base region; 
  -- assembly of a data base on the natural resources of the 
base region; 
  -- compilation of a list of application programs in support 
of the administrative mechanism; 
  -- development of programs to assess the effectiveness of 
environmental protection efforts; 
  -- development of a general plan for natural resource use in 
the base region, specifically through creation of digital maps 
regulating natural resource use. 
  b) at the federal level: 
  -- development of a conceptual model of Russia's natural and 
economic complex; 
  -- selection and adaptation of GIS programming compatible 
with the regional-level GIS; 
  -- creation of a system of federal regional information 
elements based on pooling of regional information element (TEI) 
systems at the regional level; 
  -- determination of the composition of information modules 
within the federal GIS; 
  -- determination of the composition of overview and 
overview-thematic maps; 
  -- development of the logical structures of data bases for 
the basic array of information modules; 
  -- creation of a digital map, the basis of the federal GIS; 
  -- creation of a communications channel and development of 
information interaction between the federal GIS and the GIS in 
the base region (at the level of digital base maps). 
<H5>  Section 2. International Cooperation </H5>
  The Russian Federation cooperates with more than 20 
countries 
as the legal successor to the former USSR with regard to its 
bilateral intergovernmental agreements in the area of 
environmental protection. Within the framework of those 
agreements, much attention is focused on border issues (for 
example, through agreements with Norway, Finland, and Sweden). 
Within the framework of interaction among the CIS member states, 
these issues will be resolved both on the basis of a 
multilateral agreement of 8 February 1992 and in accordance with 
bilateral agreements at the governmental level. 
  Implementation of the Agreement on Interaction in the Area 
of 
Ecology and Environmental Protection of 8 February 1993 will 
require coordinated actions by the member states and appropriate 
reflection in the National Plan of those obligations on the part 
of the Russian Federation that stem from the Agreement, as 
follows: 
  -- harmonization of any environmental protection-related 
legislative acts, environmental norms, and standards adopted; 
  -- joint development and implementation of interstate 
programs and projects in the area of natural resource use, 
including programs for the safe destruction and neutralization 
of chemical and nuclear weapons and highly toxic and radioactive 
wastes; 
  -- application of common approaches, criteria, methods, and 
procedures to assess the quality and monitor the condition of 
the environment and anthropogenic effects thereupon, and 
assurance of the compatibility of data on the state of the 
environment at the interstate and international levels; 
  -- use of coordinated methodologies to assess the effects of 
economic and other activities on the environment; 
  -- unification of methods by which to set standards for 
anthropogenic effects on the environment; 
  -- application of coordinated methods to monitor genetic 
changes in communities of living organisms and to protect rare 
and endangered species, as well as their habitats; 
  -- creation and support of an interstate ecological 
information system; 
  -- development and implementation of a coordinated 
scientific 
and technical policy in the area of ecology and environmental 
protection; conducting of coordinated basic and applied 
environmental research; 
  -- development and application of general principles 
designed 
to stimulate environmental protection efforts and sanctions 
against violators of environmental protection legislation; 
  -- adherence to general methodological requirements when 
conducting environmental assessments of programs and projections 
for the development of production capacity and of investment 
projects and other projects; 
  -- maintenance of an interstate Red Book. 
  In order to implement the National Plan, including through 
attraction of essential foreign experience and assistance, it is 
proposed that adjustments and additions be made to bilateral 
cooperation programs. These would focus on fuller utilization of 
the agreements in question. 
  In this regard, an important role will be played by the 
effective use of technical and financial assistance from 
international organizations and foreign investment. In view of 
the acuteness of environmental problems in Russia, an 
overwhelming majority of investment projects should have a 
clearly expressed environmental orientation, help improve the 
state of the environment, and be required to undergo an 
environmental assessment procedure approved by international 
organizations. 
  The obligations of the Russian Federation with regard to 
multilateral conventions and agreements as reflected in the 
National Plan will require close integration with other 
countries, in particular the European countries. 
  Implementation of the UN Conference on the Environment and 
Development (1992) in the European region will require 
coordinated actions by countries in such areas as: 
  -- change in the structure of production and consumption; 
  -- comprehensive consideration for the aspects of the 
environment and development in the course of decisionmaking; 
  -- protection of the atmosphere; 
  -- assurance of a high quality of fresh water resources; 
  -- environmentally safe use of toxic chemicals and waste 
processing and disposal; 
  -- exchange of environmentally acceptable technologies; 
  -- assistance with sustainable development of agriculture 
and 
rural areas; 
  -- protection of forests; 
  -- protection of seas and coastal areas. 
  These problems will be decided with Russia's participation 
through the mechanisms of regional and global conventions and 
international organizations. 
  A special role in this connection is played by the process 
of 
general European conferences of environmental ministers. The 
results of the second conference, held in April 1993 and 
essentially a concretization of the Rio de Janeiro forum's 
decisions for Europe, bore out the well-founded nature of that 
approach, and the Conference's main documents -- the ``Program 
of Action for the Countries of Central and Eastern Europe'' and 
the ``Declaration of the Ministers'' -- laid the groundwork for 
resolving the most pressing environmental problems of countries 
with transition economies through the use of foreign partners on 
a multilateral and bilateral basis. 
  Russia proposed that the European program give consideration 
to specific sites and areas in Russia, ecological restoration of 
which will require foreign assistance. 
  The cooperation that is currently developing with 
international financial organizations (the World Bank, the 
European Bank for Reconstruction and Development, and so on) on 
environmental protection and natural resource use in Russia will 
be focused primarily on implementation of the most important and 
capital-intensive elements of the national plan of action. Also 
focused on this will be bilateral programs of technical 
assistance to Russia. There are also proposals to combine 
efforts aimed at improving the legislative and regulatory basis 
of environmental protection efforts, creating an adequate 
infrastructure, systems for monitoring the state of the 
environment, and an information system for the purpose of 
decisionmaking, with specific measures at the regional level. 
  In large part, those measures will be aimed at improving the 
environmental situation in regions most harmful to human health, 
reinforcing the physical base and infrastructure of specially 
protected natural areas, and ensuring more efficient use of 
natural resources, in particular oil and gas. 
  A draft program for interaction with the World Bank 
envisions, in part, a stronger technical base for environmental 
protection agencies in Russia; implementation of measures to 
optimize the environmental protection system; creation of an 
appropriate regulatory and infrastructure base for that purpose; 
conducting of research projects; and implementation of measures 
in specific cities and at specific sites to solve the problems 
of industrial and household wastes, water quality (particularly 
drinking water), to reduce the level of pollutant emissions 
(including greenhouse gases) and to stop the production and use 
of substances that destroy the ozone layer; use of by-product 
gases (in the process of oil production and refining); to 
develop and appropriately equip a network of specially protected 
natural areas, and so on. 
  Detailed development and implementation of environmental 
cooperation programs will be carried out by a specially 
established center jointly directed by the World Bank and a 
council comprising the heads of the Russian Federation Ministry 
of Environmental Protection and Natural Resources, the Russian 
Federation Ministry of Fuel and Energy, the Russian Agency for 
International Cooperation and Development, and other ministries 
and agencies that will be participating in the projects. 
  In connection with Russia's signing of the framework 
Convention on Climate Change and the Biodiversity Convention and 
the need for their ratification or adoption, it will be 
necessary to take the following steps at the first stage. 
<H6>  2.1. The Convention on Climate Change: </H6>
  -- preparation of national cadastral maps of anthropogenic 
emissions from sources and absorption by absorbents of all 
greenhouse gases not regulated by the Montreal Protocol 
regarding substances that destroy the ozone layer. When such 
work is done the compatible methodologies approved by the 
parties to the Convention (in Article 4. 1a and 12a) must be 
used; 
  -- development of a national program of measures to lessen 
the effects of climate change through a comprehensive approach 
to the problems of anthropogenic emissions from sources and 
absorption of greenhouse gases by absorbents, as well as 
measures to promote adequate adaptation by sectors of the 
economy and the social realm to climate change (Article 4.15); 
  -- development of comprehensive plans in regard to 
commercial 
activity in coastal zones, water resources, agriculture, and the 
protection and restoration of regions affected by droughts, 
desertification, and floods (Article 4. 1e); 
  -- participation in the timely exchange of appropriate 
scientific, technological, technical, social, economic, and 
legal information in connection with climate and changes 
therein, as well as the economic and social effects of various 
reaction strategies (Article 4. 1h); 
  -- development of a national program of education, training, 
and public information on matters pertaining to climate change 
(Article 4. 1i and 12); 
  -- preparation of a national report on the implementation of 
Russia's obligations under the Convention (Article 4. 1j). 
  In connection with this, it is essential to carry out the 
following scientific research: 
  1. Development of a model cadastral map of greenhouse gas 
emissions (scheduled completion: 1993-94). 
  2. Development of a model cadastral map of greenhouse gas 
absorbents (scheduled completion: 1993-94). 
  3. Research on the possibility of applying the methodology 
for assessment of greenhouse gas concentrations proposed by the 
International Group of Climate Change Experts to the territory 
of the Russian Federation (scheduled completion: 1993-94). 
  4. Development of a draft national plan of research on 
climate change and its effects (scheduled completion: 1993-94). 
  5. Development of a draft program for rapid exchange of 
information pertaining to climate change (scheduled completion: 
1993-94). 
  6. Development of a draft national program to inform the 
public and train personnel in the field of climate change 
(scheduled completion: 1993-94). 
  7. Preparation of a draft national report on compliance with 
the Russian Federation's obligations under the Convention 
(scheduled completion: 1993-95). 
<H6>  2.2. The Biological Diversity Convention: </H6>
  -- development of a national strategy, plan, or program for 
the preservation and sustainable use of biological diversity; 
  -- definition of the components of biological diversity that 
are of significance for the preservation and sustainable use 
thereof, and creation of a monitoring system; 
  -- creation of a system of protected regions and regions in 
which it is essential to take special measures to preserve 
biological diversity; 
  -- development and approval of essential legislative 
standards for the preservation of threatened species and 
populations; 
  -- development and implementation of a program of scientific 
and technical study and personnel training for the purpose of 
implementing measures to define, preserve, and make sustainable 
use of biological diversity and the components thereof; 
  -- development and introduction of appropriate procedures 
for 
the conducting of environmental assessment of proposed projects 
that could have a significant negative impact on biological 
diversity; 
  -- development of national legislation regulating access to 
genetic resources and technologies and the transfer thereof. 
  The universal nature of the National Plan presumes the broad 
use for its implementation of all available mechanisms of 
interaction with other countries, including within the framework 
of international organizations, in particular the UN 
Environmental Program (UNEP), the European Economic Commission 
of the UN, the World Meteorological Organization, the World 
Health Organization (WHO), UNESCO, the UN Industrial Development 
Organization (UNIDO) and the UN Food and Agriculture 
Organization (FAO), as well as multilateral and bilateral 
international conventions and agreements. Of exceptionally great 
importance in this connection will be interaction with 
international financial organizations, through which technical, 
organizational, and financial assistance with the implementation 
of key elements in the Program will be provided. Also focused on 
these same goals will be efforts to ensure efficient use of 
foreign bilateral assistance (in addition to traditional 
bilateral cooperation in the field of environmental protection 
within the framework of appropriate agreements). 
  In addition, projects under programs of the national plan 
will also be partially financed with funding from a special 
foreign currency fund that is slated to be established by the 
Russian Federation Ministry of Environmental Protection and 
Natural Resources. It is planned that money will be paid into 
this fund by the World Bank, the European Bank for 
Reconstruction and Development, the European Investment Bank, 
and investors on the basis of various bilateral contracts. This 
fund, which will not be legally connected with the existing 
Federal Environmental Fund, will complement that fund. The 
executive mechanisms of the two funds should be combined. 
<H3>  Section 3. Ensuring Environmental Safety in Economic 
Development </H3>
  Questions of environmental safety and the measures 
implemented to achieve it should be considered an aspect of 
establishing permissible anthropogenic burdens on the 
environment and in particular on individual ecosystems, 
exceeding which could result or has already resulted in such 
irreversible changes in natural conditions that existing forms 
of adaptation by human beings, animals, plants, and 
microorganisms to the environment are not capable of ensuring 
their normal development and existence, and also as an aspect of 
preventive measures of protection against natural and manmade 
disasters. 
  The following are among the priority areas for investment: 
  -- direct capital investment aimed at protecting health. In 
regions with heavily polluted air, investment priority should be 
given to measures undertaken for the purpose of improving 
systems to control the dust level in air adjacent to enterprises 
in the nonferrous metals industry and steel smelting facilities, 
as well as measures to replace coal with gas as a source of 
energy at rayon heat and electric power stations and in homes. 
As for protection of water resources, there priority should be 
given to the initial treatment of industrial waste water 
containing a high level of heavy metals and toxic chemicals, 
which present a serious threat to groundwater and surface water, 
as well as to reduction in the excessive nitrate levels in 
drinking water sources located in rural areas; 
  -- capital investment earmarked for construction of areas 
for 
the processing, utilization, and environmentally safe storage 
(or disposal) of wastes and for production of environmentally 
safe chemical fertilizers and other agricultural chemicals; 
  -- capital investment designed to prevent and eliminate 
processes of land degradation and soil disruption and 
destruction, and to restore polluted land; 
  -- measures that provide for treatment of waste water in 
order to protect the ecology of coastal and tourist regions; 
completion of water treatment facility construction, 
particularly in areas where this could significantly improve 
water quality; implementation of programs that could prevent 
irreversible damage that might otherwise be done to the 
environment and to highly important ecosystems; 
  -- support for expansion and acceleration of capital 
investment carried out by industrial enterprises in accordance 
with implementation of the new economic policy, including 
measures such as reduction in the amount of salinated water 
discharged by mines, treatment of waste water from cellulose 
combines, textile mills, and chemical plants, and measures 
undertaken to reduce discharges of toxic substances by 
enterprises in the chemical and petrochemical industries; 
  -- measures not requiring large expenditures and designed to 
implement long-range environmental programs, especially in cases 
in which a program can be implemented quickly and with great 
savings. These include an end to the use of gasoline containing 
high lead levels, reduction in the amount of exhaust gases 
produced by automobile engines, financing of applied research in 
the field of ecosystem protection, and development of a system 
to collect, process, and distribute data and information 
pertaining to the environment. 
  Often there is much that can be achieved simply through 
``good housekeeping,'' that is, through careful repairs, efforts 
to prevent leaks, installation of more advanced monitoring 
equipment, and a reorientation toward stricter standards in the 
management of production and technologies. All these are 
economically advantageous ``no-lose'' measures, which will 
improve the economic results of enterprises' operations and 
decrease the amount of environmental damage they do. These sorts 
of small-scale actions will lay the groundwork for improvement 
in the state of the environment in connection with 
transformation of economic policy. These measures are very 
important, because large-scale introduction of anti-pollution 
technologies in various industries cannot be carried out until 
new markets are created for various types of products and the 
economic viability of specific enterprises is assured. 
  One important stage in defining scientifically based 
priorities in natural resource use and ways of implementing them 
is development of a comprehensive state scientific and technical 
program to be entitled ``Environmental Safety in Russia.'' 
  The top priority in efforts to achieve environmental safety 
is adoption of urgent measures to lower the level of effects on 
the environment and on human beings by ``hot spots'' in Russia 
to a safe level by the year 2005. 
  Toward that end, it is essential: 
  -- to develop criteria by which to assess the degree of 
environmental danger in such areas; 
  -- to conduct exploration and mapping of those areas with 
the 
aid of the criteria thus developed; 
  -- to develop and implement a plan of measures to gradually 
reduce environmental danger in such areas; 
  -- to create a system to monitor the condition of the 
aforementioned areas and the health of the people living in them; 
  -- to develop and introduce a system to warn employees of 
enterprises and the public in the event of particularly 
dangerous occurrences. 
  The next focus of efforts to ensure environmental security 
is 
elimination of accidents, manmade disasters, emergency 
meteorological situations, natural disasters, and the effects 
thereof. This will require: 
  -- ranking of production facilities, technologies, and types 
of operations in order to reduce technological and environmental 
danger on the basis of risk theory; 
  -- development and introduction of automated systems to 
monitor the most dangerous types of operations, production 
facilities, and installations. 
<H6>  3.1. Prevention and Elimination of the Effects of Accidents, 
Disasters, and Other Emergency Situations </H6>
  In order to lessen the likelihood of environmentally 
hazardous situations occurring, to reduce the scale of their 
effects, and to ensure human safety, it is essential that the 
following measures be implemented. 
  Criteria must be established in zones and at sites with an 
elevated level of environmental hazard identified in 1993-94. 
Facilities in the economy that are hazardous to the environment 
and human beings in the course of normal operations and in the 
event of accidental emissions (or discharges) of radioactive or 
chemical substances used, manufactured, or stored at those 
facilities must be inventoried and ranked. On the basis of this 
inventory, the following must be developed and implemented for 
enterprises and organizations, with consideration for input from 
local soviets of people's deputies: 
  -- a system of measures to maximally reduce the risk of 
environmentally hazardous situations emerging during the 
construction and use of chemical and petrochemical facilities 
and nuclear power facilities, on the continental shelf during 
the production of oil and gas, at mine tailing storage sites, at 
high dams, and at anti-mudslide and avalanche-protection 
installations, particularly in seismically active regions where 
fuel, radioactive substances, and toxic substances are stored; 
  -- programs to bring about the technical refitting, 
redesignation, or removal of worn-out and environmentally 
hazardous production facilities and enterprises, as well as 
planned resettlement of persons living within the boundaries of 
sanitary protection zones and zones surrounding enterprises in 
the chemical, petrochemical, microbiological, gas production and 
refining, metallurgical, coke, and chemical fertilizer 
industries and other environmentally hazardous enterprises and 
production facilities. 
  Means of early detection and emergency shutdown of equipment 
and shutdown of technological processes, as well as automated 
means of assessing the reliability of and danger of fire or 
explosion created by equipment, should be developed and put in 
place at commercial facilities. 
  Model regional plans for recovery from the effects of 
probable environmentally hazardous situations must be developed. 
  A national center for immediate environmental assistance 
should be established, and there should be participation in the 
establishment of similar international systems. 
  Additions must be made to building standards and regulations 
which regulate the siting of potentially hazardous facilities in 
Russia, as well as those that establish the requirement to 
include emergency planning and environmental assessment in 
planning documentation. 
<H6>  3.2. Ensuring Radiation Safety </H6>
  In order to ensure the safety of the public and the 
environment from radiation, it is essential: 
  -- to improve the existing system of radiation monitoring 
within Russian territory through establishment of Unified State 
Automated Radiation Level Monitoring; 
  -- to implement comprehensive monitoring of the radiation 
levels within Russian territory; 
  -- to develop and introduce standards in regard to 
protection 
of the public and the environment from radiation; 
  -- to develop and implement programs to normalize the 
radiation situation and to rehabilitate radiation-contaminated 
areas of Russia; 
  -- to present annual reports to the Government of the 
Russian 
Federation regarding the state of and additional measures to 
ensure the public's radiation safety; 
  -- to ensure close cooperation between Russia's ministries 
and agencies in regard to the introduction of unified 
requirements governing public radiation safety; 
  -- to conduct an analysis and assessment of scenarios for 
possible accidents at all existing enterprises and facilities in 
the nuclear power cycle within Russian territory; 
  -- to develop a system of measures to warn and inform the 
public in the event of emergency radiation situations (accidents 
and disasters); 
  -- to develop and introduce a series of scientific and 
technical measures to reduce the effects of radon and similar 
substances on public health; 
  -- to carry out a detailed survey of all cities with a 
population greater than 100,000 by 1995 and of all cities with a 
population greater than 50,000 by 2000 for the purpose of 
locating unidentified sources of ionizing radiation, with 
subsequent cleanup of those sources, as well as 
gamma-spectroscope surveys of areas where nuclear detonations 
have occurred; 
  -- to conduct a study of areas where nuclear substances have 
been disposed of within the republic's territory, particularly 
at industrial enterprises in the nuclear power cycle and in 
bodies of water; 
  -- to objectively inform the public regarding the state of 
the environmental radiation level in the Russian Federation; 
  -- to arrange training and advanced training for specialists 
in the fields of radiation safety and environmental radiation 
safety. 
<H6>  3.3. Prevention of Environmental Pollution by Production and 
Consumption Wastes </H6>
  In order to prevent pollution of the environment by 
dangerous 
wastes resulting from production and consumption, it is 
essential that the following goals be achieved: 
  -- development in 1993 of a state Waste Program, to include 
research and development work to create new technologies and 
equipment for the processing of wastes and the production of 
such equipment; 
  -- accelerated drafting of a law ``On Production and 
Consumption Wastes''; 
  -- an inventory of all ministry-operated areas within 
Russian 
territory where wastes are stored (sludge and mine tailings 
storage, settling ponds, accumulators, spoils, and so on), as 
well as unauthorized dumps for the disposal of 
production-related and solid household waste; 
  -- on the basis of the data from the inventory and ranking 
of 
the industrial wastes created by enterprises, creation of a 
republic data bank on those wastes and technologies by which to 
process them; 
  -- creation of a stock-based exchange to engage in free 
trading in information and scientific and technical advances in 
the fields of production-related and consumption-related waste 
collection, transportation, utilization, and disposal; 
  -- incentives for destatization of enterprises that collect 
and process waste; 
  -- establishment of small businesses and joint ventures to 
recover usable materials and manufacture products out of them; 
  -- implementation of accelerated development of capacities 
to 
collect and utilize various types of secondary resources, plus 
introduction of progressive technologies for their processing; 
  -- development and introduction of technologies to 
neutralize 
and process toxic industrial wastes; 
  -- development of a plan for the siting of toxic industrial 
waste and solid household waste storage facilities in Russia 
based on regional planning documents and projects; 
  -- construction of specialized facilities for the 
neutralization and environmentally safe disposal (or storage) of 
toxic industrial wastes for which there are currently no 
environmentally or economically acceptable means of processing; 
  -- guarantees of environmental safety in the operations of 
facilities that destroy chemical weapons, including the storage 
of such weapons at their point of origin, transportation to 
destruction sites, destruction (or neutralization) of the 
weapons, destruction (or utilization) of the products of 
neutralization, and disposal of nontoxic waste; 
  -- monitoring of the collection, processing, and 
transportation of used daylight lamps that contain mercury and 
other heavy metals; 
  -- introduction of enterprises (or installations) to 
neutralize pesticides that have been banned or are not suitable 
for use; 
  -- introduction of a method of combined processing of solid 
household waste with preliminary separation of valuable 
components, composting of organic wastes, and utilization of the 
noncomposted residue for pyrolysis; 
  -- development of an industrial-scale technology to obtain 
biogases at storage sites (or dumps) and make comprehensive use 
of such gases, with a primary goal of creating appropriate 
facilities for cities with a population of more than 100,000; 
  -- development of garbage processing plants with a capacity 
of 23-25 percent of all solid household waste by the year 2005. 
<H6>  3.4. Conversion and Ecology </H6>
  A solution to the problem of environmental safety and 
achievement of goals that will improve the environmental 
situation in the Russian Federation will be more difficult 
without the use of the defense complex's production capacity and 
scientific and engineering potential. Therefore, a number of 
state programs for conversion of the defense complex include a 
separate Conversion and Ecology program. 
  Those programs' goals are: 
  -- to improve the environmental situation in regions with a 
critical anthropogenic burden; 
  -- to bring about restructuring of the various sectors of 
the 
military-industrial complex in order to solve environmental 
problems; 
  -- to steadily expand civilian production capacity of 
environmentally oriented products; 
  -- to create an economic mechanism for achieving the 
environmental goals of conversion; 
  -- attraction of funding for environmentally oriented 
conversion measures; 
  -- inclusion of the environmental conversion agenda in the 
structure of radical economic reform in the Russian Federation. 
  In order to accomplish these tasks, the Conversion and 
Ecology program makes provision for: 
  -- establishment and accelerated development of a market in 
environmental jobs and services; 
  -- inclusion of a mechanism of state economic regulation and 
incentives for conversion-related environmental measures; 
  -- legal and economic standards in support of the mechanism 
by which the environmental aspect of conversion functions; 
  -- structural and informational support for the program and 
coordination of efforts. 
  The first stage in the Conversion and Ecology program, 
scheduled for 1993, will create a scientific and technical 
foundation upon which to develop and prepare for serial 
production, beginning in 1994, new types of environmental 
protection equipment, technologies, materials, and monitoring 
devices, as well as to establish production relations and 
cooperation on the manufacture of environmentally oriented 
products in place of ties disrupted or neglected following the 
disintegration of the USSR. 
  The program includes goals in the following main areas: 
  -- development and creation (introduction) of new 
technologies and equipment to treat gaseous emissions and waste 
water and to process, neutralize, and recycle solid waste (Area 
1); 
  -- development and creation (introduction) of measuring and 
information systems to provide background monitoring of the 
state of the environment and monitor pollution sources (Area 2); 
  -- development (introduction) of methods and means of 
restoring natural areas disrupted by economic and military 
activities (Area 3); 
  -- development and creation (introduction) of new, 
environmentally clean resource- and energy-conserving 
technologies and types of manufacture (Area 4); 
  -- establishment of a physical and technical base for a 
maritime environmental monitoring system to monitor Russia's 
economic zone and territorial waters (Area 5); 
  -- establishment of a legal and economic mechanism to 
regulate and stimulate federal systems of environmentally safe 
and sustainable development in the process of defense industry 
conversion (Area 6); 
  -- restructuring of the economic complex in regions with a 
critical environmental situation as part of the process of 
defense industry conversion in the Russian Federation (Area 7). 
<H6>  3.5. Environmental Support for the Armed Forces </H6>
  The goal of environmental support for the Russian Armed 
Forces is to achieve environmental safety in the operations of 
the Russian Federation Armed Forces and to protect personnel, 
weapons, and military equipment under conditions of 
environmentally adverse anthropogenic and natural factors. 
  The principal focuses and goals of the Russian Armed Forces 
in the area of environmental protection are: 
  -- environmental support for the day-to-day operations of 
troops and naval forces; 
  -- environmental support for the operations of the Russian 
Armed Forces in conditions in which they are affected by 
environmentally adverse anthropogenic and natural factors; 
  -- environmental monitoring of the Russian Armed Forces 
within the system of state environmental monitoring; 
  -- restoration of the environment in the process of the 
Armed 
Forces' day-to-day operations following maneuvers, special work, 
accidents, and disasters at military facilities; 
  -- military-scientific support for the principal areas of 
Russian Armed Forces environmental safety; 
  -- participation in environmental support in all the stages 
of the life cycle of weapons and military equipment and the 
planning, construction, and use of Russian Armed Forces 
facilities, in conversion of defense manufacturing facilities, 
and in all the stages of utilization and destruction of nuclear, 
chemical, and conventional weapons and military equipment; 
  -- interaction with state and ministerial environmental 
protection organs and international cooperation on environmental 
support for military operations; 
  -- training of military ecologists. 
  Priority tasks with regard to Russian Armed Forces 
environmental support are: 
  -- participation in the utilization of nuclear power 
facilities and nuclear warheads and in the storage and 
utilization of radioactive waste; 
  -- participation in the removal of metal fragments and 
rocket 
fuel from areas where pieces of booster rockets land; 
  -- utilization of outdated or damaged military equipment and 
weapons, including nuclear submarines, long-range missiles, and 
chemical weapons; 
  -- qualitative improvement in the condition of bases and 
depots for fuel, lubricants, and rocket fuel components 
(reservoirs, pumping stations, and fuel pipelines); 
  -- assessment of the environmental damage caused by troops 
in 
their countries of deployment; 
  -- construction of new and reconstruction or expansion of 
existing treatment facilities; 
  -- conducting of environmental ranking of military 
facilities 
and establishment of an environmental monitoring system; 
  -- implementation of comprehensive and ongoing environmental 
training and education for military personnel, Army and Navy 
employees, and members of their families; 
  -- establishment and proper outfitting of environmental 
units, which will be assigned to restore disrupted environments. 
<H6>  3.6. Environmental Aspects of the Development of the Fuel 
and Energy Complex </H6>
  The priority of environmental efforts in the strategy to 
develop the fuel and energy complex results from that complex's 
very intensive negative effects on the environment. For example, 
enterprises in the fuel and energy complex account for 50 
percent of all emissions into the atmosphere, up to 35 percent 
of all waste water discharges into natural bodies of water, and 
approximately 30 percent of all solid waste, which occupies 
significant areas of productive land and constitutes a source of 
secondary pollution. 
  The main principle guiding the assurance of environmental 
safety in the fuel and energy complex is a comprehensive 
approach to efficient use and conservation of fuel and energy 
resources at all stages of their production and processing on 
the basis of progressive and environmentally clean technologies, 
including the functioning of unified energy technology 
installations. 
  A significant role in reduction of environmental pollution 
can be played by optimization of the fuel and energy balance as 
it relates to the structure and siting of other production 
facilities that release harmful substances, as well as by an 
increase in the percentage of centralized heat supply to 
industrial and nonindustrial facilities. 
  There are plans for a transition from traditional methods of 
fuel combustion to the use of new furnaces, and to the 
development and introduction of steam-gas and gas-turbine 
installations employing intracycle coal gasification. 
  It is essential that incentives be provided for the 
development and introduction into use of nontraditional, 
environmentally clean methods of producing energy (using solar, 
thermal, wind, and biomass power), as well as low-potential 
energy sources. 
  There will be marked progress toward improvement of the 
system for the collection, transportation, and refining of 
by-product gaseous products, as well in the detection, location, 
and elimination of oil leaks and spills in production and 
refining regions, particularly under the environmentally 
sensitive conditions that exist in the North. 
  In view of the objective orientation toward primary use of 
coal to produce energy, environmentally clean technologies for 
coal mining, transportation, upgrading, and processing are 
becoming more widely used, with mandatory utilization of waste 
products, recultivation of disrupted land, and ecosystem 
restoration. 
  Research and development work will continue on the 
development and manufacture of high-efficiency methods and 
equipment to purify exhaust gases and utilize the products thus 
trapped, particularly sulfur compounds, nitrogen oxides, and 
hydrocarbons, as well as on equipment to treat waste water, 
including recirculating systems and systems to process and 
utilize sludge. 
<H5>  Section 4. Environmental Training and Education </H5>
  The principal goals of environmental training and education 
are to develop an environmental culture in individuals and 
throughout society and environmental awareness and thinking and 
a responsible attitude toward nature on the part of each person, 
and to foster practical experience with natural resource use and 
competent decisionmaking. 
  The main principles of environmental training and education 
are: 
  -- universality and continuity; 
  -- vertical and horizontal integration of formal and 
informal 
training and educational structures; 
  -- flexibility, variability, a problem-oriented approach, 
and 
continuity in study and training; 
  -- unity of general, vocational, and ecological training and 
education; 
  -- consideration for practical needs; 
  -- consideration for ethnic interests and for cultural and 
regional characteristics; 
  -- humanization and an orientation toward development of a 
socially active individual and environmental awareness, 
thinking, and culture. 
  On the basis of these fundamental goals and principles of 
environmental training and education, and on the basis of the 
Russian Federation law ``On Environmental Protection,'' the 
overall goal of the strategy for development of environmental 
training and education is to create a system of universal 
comprehensive and continuing environmental training and 
education that will encompass the entire process of preschool 
and school training and education, vocational training for 
specialists at secondary and higher educational institutions, 
and advanced training for such specialists with the aid of the 
mass media. 
  The structure of this system of universal comprehensive and 
continuing environmental training and education (subsequently to 
be referred to as the system of continuing environmental 
training and education [SNEVO]) may be represented by the 
following basic and interconnected branches: 
  -- preschool environmental training in the family and in 
specialized training institutions, both state and private; 
  -- environmental education for workers (training of workers 
at vocational and technical schools and on the job); 
  -- environmental education for middle-level specialists 
(training at technical secondary schools, at higher vocational 
schools, and at pedagogical schools); 
  -- environmental education at higher schools: special 
environmental education, introduction of environmental training 
for specialists in all fields and areas of specialization, and 
environmental training for academic and scientific personnel; 
  -- environmental education for specialists and 
administrators 
with higher and secondary specialized education (special 
courses, advanced training courses, advanced training 
institutes, and academic centers); 
  -- on-the-job environmental education for blue-collar 
workers, office workers, engineering and technical personnel, 
and administrative personnel at enterprises and in the social 
realm; 
  -- informal environmental training and education, and 
self-education for children and adults. 
  The principal measures by which to implement this strategy 
are: 
  a) Creation a state/private system to administer SNEVO. This 
will require: 
  -- identification of existing state and private 
organizations 
that have experience with cooperation in the field of 
environmental training and education, development of functional 
and structural diagrams, and establishment of state/private 
administration for SNEVO on a basis of legal standards; 
  -- creation of interdepartmental coordinating and 
methodological councils at all levels and a higher state 
certification commission to issue certificates and licenses in 
the field of environmental training and education; 
  -- establishment of a Russian (International) Center for 
Environmental Training and Education and a network of regional 
centers (an environmental education space). 
  b) Establishment of a foundation of legal standards. This 
will require: 
  -- development of sublegal acts, normative acts, standards, 
and the other normative legal documents that are essential for 
the establishment, functioning, and development of SNEVO. 
  c) Preparation of the scientific and methodological base. 
This will require: 
  -- analysis and selection on the basis of quality of 
scientific plans for methodological complexes (qualifications 
descriptions, standards, curricula and programs, methodological 
guidelines, computer programs, and so on), textbooks, and mass 
media materials; 
  -- development and publication of textbooks and start-up of 
audiovisual program production; 
  -- development and creation of programs for mass media 
communications. 
  d) Development of a system of personnel support for all 
levels and types of environmental training and education. This 
will require: 
  -- development of qualifications descriptions, standards, 
content, and methodologies for the training of SNEVO 
instructional personnel at universities, higher pedagogical 
institutions, schools, and colleges; 
  -- organization of training for personnel studying SNEVO 
planning and administration. 
  e) Creation of a state/private system to provide the 
reliable 
and timely environmental information essential to and adequate 
for high-quality environmental training and education of the 
entire population. This will require: 
  -- establishment of the informational data bases essential 
to 
the functioning of SNEVO; 
  -- organization of universal community environmental 
training 
and children's programs utilizing various means of 
communications; 
  -- creation of a system to provide environmentally 
significant information to state and private SNEVO organizations 
and the public; 
  -- establishment of a universal interregional information 
and 
reference system linked with the international information 
network. 
  f) Orientation of the content of environmental training and 
education toward individual development and solutions to the 
problems of society's sustainable socioeconomic development and 
environmental safety. This will require: 
  -- provision of reliable information in the field of 
environmental protection and efficient natural resource use, 
socioeconomic development, and environmental and 
socio-environmental situations at the regional, republic, 
national, and world levels to educators, teachers, and 
instructors; 
  -- provision of information regarding the fundamental 
principles of normative legal documents in the field of 
environmental protection and efficient natural resource use to 
all participants in SNEVO; 
  -- analysis of the content of environmental training and 
education from the standpoint of the need for its updating or 
creation, or for developments that will take into consideration 
the requirements for its reorientation, with participation by 
scientists and experts in the appropriate fields of knowledge 
and activity; 
  -- retraining of educators for the system of formal and 
informal education in a field of new or updated content, and 
introduction of that field into curricula, programs, and the 
educational process. 
  International cooperation in the field of environmental 
training and education is an important means of implementing 
SNEVO. 
  The primary goal of this is to utilize international 
experience and include Russia in the world process of ecological 
training and education. From the standpoint of achieving the 
goal of international cooperation, the following measures have 
priority: 
  -- creation of a national service for the collection, 
processing, and dissemination of environmental information, and 
its inclusion in the international system; 
  -- realization of joint research and projects to design 
technologies and means of studying psychological and pedagogical 
support for the education process; 
  -- participation in projects within the framework of 
international educational programs in the field of ecology and 
environmental protection, UNESCO, and UNEP; 
  -- widespread and systematic dissemination of results 
obtained by the international community and their adaptation to 
the conditions of environmental training and education in Russia; 
  -- development and realization of joint projects in the 
field 
of training and advanced training for ecologists and scientific 
and pedagogical personnel; 
  -- creation of an international methodology coordination 
center for environmental training and education; 
  -- exchange of schoolchildren, students, and specialists in 
the field of environmental training and education. 
  Creation of a well-developed SNEVO will be a lengthy and 
gradual process of improving existing and developing lacking 
elements and branches in the structure of environmental training 
and education and integrating them into the system of general 
and vocational education. 
<H3>  Section 5. Priority Measures and Focuses of Environmental 
Restoration </H3>
  In accordance with the Russian Federation law ``On 
Environmental Protection'' (Section 1, p 4), the following must 
be protected against pollution, spoilage, damages, exhaustion, 
and destruction: 
  -- natural ecological systems and the ozone layer; 
  -- land, mineral resources, surface water and groundwater, 
the atmosphere, forests and other vegetation, animals, 
microorganisms, the genetic stock, and natural landscapes; 
  -- state nature preserves, nature reserves, national nature 
parks, natural monuments, rare or endangered plant and animal 
species, and their habitats. 
  On the basis of the above, priority issues that require the 
development of programs at the federal level have been defined. 
<H6>  5.1. Focuses of Environmental Protection and Efficient 
Natural Resource Use </H6>
  Basic measures to improve the environmental situation in 
Russia as applicable to various environments and resources are 
as follows. 
<H6>  5.1.1. Water Resources </H6>
  Water resources are polluted virtually everywhere in Russia. 
  The level of pollution of surface water varies widely. 
Levels 
in excess of the MPC [maximum permissible concentration] for 
petroleum products, organic substances, ammonium and nitrite 
nitrogen, zinc, and other pollutants are found in 20-40 percent 
of all samples analyzed. 
  Discharge of waste water by enterprises and municipal 
facilities has resulted in the degradation of many aquatic 
ecosystems. Agriculture has a considerable effect on the quality 
of surface water through farming, particularly irrigated 
farming, pasturage, livestock farms, and other facilities that 
represent a major source of organic substances and pesticides in 
natural water. The adverse effects of economic activity are 
reflected most markedly in the state of small rivers, many of 
which have been turned into waste-water canals and are clogged 
with reeds, are silted up, and have courses that have to a 
considerable extent lost their carrying capacity and drainage 
ability. 
  In order to protect and make efficient use of Russia's water 
resources, it will be necessary in 1993 to draft an 
environmental program entitled ``Efficient Use of Water 
Resources and Restoration of Water Quality,'' to include: 
  -- development of a methodology for determining and 
standards 
governing environmentally permissible diversion of water 
resources from river watersheds; 
  -- revision of the methodology for calculating maximum 
permissible content standards, with the goal of calculating the 
pollutant burden on bodies of water by including fallout from 
the atmosphere and watershed runoff (i.e., drainage from drained 
land, unchanneled and untreated waste water from cities and 
industrial sites, and agricultural runoff); 
  -- with consideration for the aforementioned standards, 
development and approval of comprehensive plans for the use and 
protection of water resources in the principal watersheds of 
rivers, and in particular for regions with an acute 
environmental situation; 
  -- development of the status of specially protected river 
watersheds and a corresponding Russian law; 
  -- completion of the development of plans for water 
protection zones (strips) along rivers, demarcation of 
boundaries of shoreline strips, and establishment of regulations 
governing natural resource use in these, particularly in river 
watersheds in the Central, Central Chernozem, Volga, and 
Northern Caucasus economic regions; 
  -- implementation of a series of measures to reduce 
pollution 
of bodies of water and halt most discharges of untreated waste 
water into bodies of water by 1996; 
  -- development and implementation of measures designed to 
completely halt log drives; 
  -- use of the introduction of water-conserving technologies 
to stabilize and then reduce the amount of fresh water diverted 
for industrial needs; 
  -- reduction in the discharge of heavy metal salts, toxic 
compounds, and biogenic substances into marine basins to levels 
that will ensure stabilization of marine ecosystems; 
  -- development of technology and efficient equipment to 
clean 
up oil spills in marine basins and shelf deposits of heavy 
fractions of oil pollutants; 
  -- continuation of work on engineering and technical support 
for the environmental safety of marine transportation, and 
development by 1994 of methods and technical means of conducting 
loading and unloading operations with chemical cargo that is 
carried in bulk solid or liquid form, which will prevent the 
release of pollutants into the environment. By 1995, all 
granular chemical cargo must be transported in packages or in 
especially designed railway cars. Efforts to improve the designs 
of tanker and dry-cargo ships must be speeded up, including 
through their outfitting with environmental protection equipment; 
  -- development of environmentally safe methods and technical 
means of exploring and processing sea floor resources, utilizing 
foreign experience; 
  -- completion of a geological survey of the continental 
shelf, including geo-ecological mapping, first near major urban, 
industrial, recreational, and defense agglomerations, and also 
within the bounds of the most dangerously seismically active 
maritime zones along the coastline of the Caucasus, the Crimea, 
Kamchatka, and Sakhalin; 
  -- development of a methodology for short-term and long-term 
prediction of destructive earthquakes in seismically active 
maritime zones in the Pacific and Alpine-Mediterranean seismic 
belts; 
  -- substantial improvement in public water supplies and 
improvement of drinking water quality to public health standards 
by 1995, toward which end it will be necessary: 
  -- to ensure the use of underground water, as a rule, as 
sources of drinking water and water for household use; 
  -- to reduce the use of drinking water for technical 
purposes 
by a factor of 1.5; 
  -- to develop new combined methods of decontaminating 
drinking water and its conditioning, including desalination, 
iron removal, fluoride removal, and so on; 
  -- to do research on and start up production of absorbents 
to 
remove radionuclides from drinking water; 
  -- to oversee the manufacture of portable installations for 
collective and individual use to treat and disinfect drinking 
water in rural areas and under field conditions; 
  -- to establish enterprises to manufacture water measurement 
equipment to meet water users' demand for means of monitoring 
the amount of water they divert and discharge; 
  -- to create capacities capable of supplying the public with 
bottled drinking water; 
  -- to expand efforts to build and renovate water supply and 
sewage systems, as well as facilities for thorough treatment of 
waste water in the republic's cities and other population 
centers; 
  -- to develop means and ways of utilizing the residue that 
accumulates at water supply and sewage facilities; 
  -- to develop programs to increase Russia's production of 
the 
basic chemical reagents for drinking water production (aluminum 
sulfate, liquid chlorine in containers and tanks, and 
polyacrylamide); 
  -- to reassess construction standards and regulations in the 
field of sewage system planning, making provision therein for a 
ban on acceptance of substances by community sewage systems that 
cannot be removed by biological treatment facilities; 
  -- to establish a specialized industrial base to produce 
modern and high-efficiency water filtration equipment for 
complete installations, pumps, turbines, measurement and 
automation devices, membranes, reagents, and so on; 
  -- to create automated monitoring and control systems to 
maintain water quality in centralized systems for commercial and 
drinking water supply; 
  -- to make provision for urgent measures to develop the 
centralized water supply in rural population centers. 
<H6>  5.1.2. The Atmosphere </H6>
  Despite the substantial drop in manufacturing output (by 
25-30 percent) that has occurred in virtually every sector of 
the economy, pollutant emissions into the atmosphere from point 
sources in 1991 decreased by less than 9 percent in comparison 
to the previous year, and totalled approximately 32 million 
tonnes. 
  There has been a steady increase in concentrations of 
nitrogen oxide and nitrogen dioxide. A high level of pollution 
often results from low-level and unorganized sources of 
emissions of specific (to various sectors) pollutants. The air 
continues to be polluted by hydrogen fluoride (in the vicinity 
of aluminum plants), carbon disulfide (in the vicinity of 
enterprises manufacturing synthetic fibers), and other harmful 
substances. 
  In order to prevent air pollution by stationary and mobile 
sources of pollutant emissions, it is essential that a Clean Air 
for Russia program be developed, to include: 
  -- commencement in 1993 of efforts to monitor motor vehicle 
emissions, including compounds containing lead, sulfur, heavy 
particles, benz(a)pyrene, polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons and 
aldehydes; development and introduction as of 1993 of state 
emission standards for currently manufactured and new models of 
vehicles on a par with standards in effect in the most developed 
countries; 
  -- acceleration of the transition of transportation to 
compressed and liquified gas, introduction of special converters 
for motor vehicle exhaust fumes and introduction of soot 
filters, and establishment of diagnostic centers and stations to 
monitor the technical condition of vehicles; an increase in the 
production and use of unleaded gasolines to 80 percent by 1996; 
  -- complete resettlement of residents out of sanitary 
protection zones around enterprises no later than 1995 and 
according to schedules agreed upon with local soviet organs, 
regarding this as a priority social and economic objective; 
  -- implementation of measures that will make it possible to 
reduce emissions of specific toxic substances (compounds 
containing chlorine, fluorine, carbon disulfide, hydrogen 
sulfide, mercury, lead, methylmercaptanes, paprine proteins, 
individual hydrocarbons, and so on) in technological processes 
by 50 percent; 
  -- a significant increase in the production of low-ash and 
low-sulfur types of fuel, to be used primarily in areas with an 
acute environmental situation; 
  -- increase by 43-45 by 1995 the number of cities with a 
network of stationary stations and points for monitoring the 
level of air pollution, and introduction of automated air 
pollution monitoring systems in 1993-95 in the cities of 
Angarsk, Berezinki, Krasnoyarsk, Magnitogorsk, Norilsk, Omsk, 
Sterlitamak, Salavat, Tolyatti and Cherepovets; commencement of 
such work in the cities of Bratsk, Nizhniy Novgorod, Lipetsk, 
Perm, Yekaterinburg, Ufa, Chelyabinsk, Nizhniy Tagil, 
Novokuznetsk, Novosibirsk, and Kemerovo; 
  -- start-up of serial production of modern gas filtration 
and 
scrubber systems and instruments to monitor air pollution and 
emissions from point sources; 
  -- reduction of sulfur oxide emissions by 50 percent in 
comparison to 1980 levels in the Republic of Karelia, Leningrad 
Oblast, and Murmansk by no later than 1995, in compliance with 
an intergovernmental agreement between the USSR and Finland. 
<H6>  5.1.2.1. Protection of the Ozone Layer </H6>
  In order to solve the global international environmental 
problem of how to preserve the ozone layer and protect human 
beings from the harmful effects of ultraviolet radiation, and in 
compliance with the Russian Federation's obligations stemming 
from the Vienna Conference (1985) and the Montreal Protocol 
(1987), it is essential to develop a program entitled 
``Production of Ozone-Safe Coolants and Compliance With the 
Russian Federation's International Obligations in Regard to 
Protection of the Ozone Layer,'' which should include the 
following measures: 
  -- implementation of monitoring of the ozone layer and 
timely 
detection of trends toward the thinning thereof; 
  -- construction of an environmental model based on the 
system 
``human beings--the biosphere--the ozone layer''; 
  -- development of a proposal to ensure environmental safety 
in the development of Russian Federation industry; 
  -- introduction into the country's economy of ozone-safe 
coolants for refrigeration equipment and components for foam 
plastic materials using alternative compounds and aerosol 
packaging with ozone-safe propellants, as well as those using no 
propellants. Current production facilities that use 
ozone-damaging substances must be completely rebuilt in order to 
make them capable of using hydrocarbon propellants, replacing 
fluorine-containing solvents and developing formulas for new 
detergents for cleaning various types of equipment; 
  -- creation of alternative halocarbons and 
chlorofluorocarbons (CFC's) for use in existing machines and 
equipment; 
  -- conducting of efforts in connection with the collection 
and processing of significant quantities of ozone-destroying 
substances that are currently in use in various systems and 
pieces of equipment in many industries. 
<H6>  5.1.3. The Land and Soil </H6>
  Processes of land pollution and degradation, and the 
disruption and destruction of soils, particularly in farming 
areas, continue to develop in a catastrophic manner. 
  Enormous environmental and socioeconomic damage is done by 
soil erosion and formation of ravines, contamination of the land 
with toxic and radioactive substances and consumption- and 
production-related wastes, desertification of pasture land in 
arid and tundra zones, disruption of the land in the process of 
mining, construction, geological exploration, and other types of 
work, packing and degradation of soils due to the use of heavy 
agricultural equipment, degradation of soils due to irrigation 
and drying, losses of valuable land due to flooding and subsoil 
flooding as a result of hydraulic installation construction, 
increasing soil acidity due to the effects of acid rain and use 
of acidic chemical fertilizers, and the progressive development 
of floods, landslides, and land slippage. 
  These negative processes are occurring over areas totalling 
hundreds of millions of hectares. The land area contaminated by 
hazardous substances exceeds 62 million hectares. 
  In order to increase the sustainability of agricultural 
production in Russia, the Government of the Russian Federation 
has developed and approved the State Comprehensive Program To 
Increase Soil Fertility in Russia (Government Decree No. 879, 
issued on 17 November 1992). 
  That program includes: 
  -- greater consideration for ecology in agriculture and 
other 
land use in the process of land reform and the interfarm 
redistribution that will occur in 1993-95; 
  -- development and implementation of republic and regional 
programs to protect land against degradation and conserve and 
restore lands already degraded; 
  -- comprehensive study and mapping of land resources and the 
soil and vegetative cover in order to create a basic foundation 
for a cadastral land map, as well as comprehensive study and 
mapping of agricultural land with regard to humus content, 
micro- and macro-elements, heavy metals, and residual quantities 
of pesticides, nitrates, and radionuclides; 
  -- development in 1993-94 of scientific groundwork for 
agriculture and land use, and economic incentives for efficient 
land use; 
  -- conducting of rapid hydrogeological and geological 
engineering research to predict the water-salinity ratio and the 
balance of soils and groundwater, as well as to make 
recommendations concerning ways of preventing negative effects 
from land improvement; 
  -- development of a program to restore land, the condition 
of 
which has worsened as a result of swamp formation and salination; 
  -- changes in the structure of capital investment in land 
improvement efforts that will increase the proportion of work 
done to radically improve low-productivity farmland and make it 
arable; tighter monitoring of strict compliance with 
environmental protection requirements in the course of the 
construction, renovation, and use of land improvement systems, 
as well as during the use of areas thus reclaimed; 
  -- plantings in 1993-95 of protective woodlands on an area 
of 
at least 225,000 hectares, including field-protecting windbreaks 
on 72,000 hectares; 
  -- an increase in protection of crops from pests and 
diseases 
by biological means to 80 percent in soil under cover and to 40 
percent under field conditions; 
  -- substantial reduction in the area of waterlogged land; 
  -- rapid recultivation of disrupted land, with the goal of 
reducing disrupted areas by at least 30 percent by 1995; 
recultivation over an area of 384,000 hectares, including at 
least 188,000 hectares for use as farmland; 
  -- a 25 percent reduction by 1995 in the amount of fertile 
topsoil in storage, with improved utilization thereof in the 
reestablishment of fertility on recultivated land and 
low-productivity farmland; improvement of low-productivity 
agricultural land through application of fertile topsoil to an 
area of 50,000 hectares; 
  -- reassessment of standards for the number of livestock 
permitted per unit of land, with consideration for the specific 
nature of their care and the pasturage methods employed; by 
1995, development of a measure to regulate the number of 
livestock on the basis of the current and potential yield of 
land used for feed production; 
  -- a halt to processes producing lower soil fertility 
through 
improved quality and efficiency in the use of organic 
fertilizers. By 1995 use of organic fertilizers should be 
increased to 600 million tonnes, and by the year 2000 to 700-750 
million tonnes, through improvement in the storage and 
processing of manure, widespread use of straw, peat, sapropel, 
and waste products from agricultural and industrial production; 
  -- development of a system of measures in regard to the 
comprehensive application of chemical fertilizers and 
pesticides, with provision for their safe use in agricultural 
production; 
  -- development of a program to create agricultural equipment 
with permissible effects on soils; 
  -- a ban on the use of lands of natural 
preservation-related, 
therapeutic, recreational, historical, or cultural significance 
for industrial and agricultural purposes; 
  -- a halt to the allocation of particularly valuable 
agricultural land for state and public needs; 
  -- granting of areas to small peoples and ethnic groups for 
traditional natural resource use that will not be subject to 
expropriation or industrial development; 
  -- conducting in 1993 of an inventory of land disrupted in 
the course of mining, geological exploration, construction, and 
other work, with the findings of this inventory to be used to 
implement essential measures aimed at accelerating and improving 
the recultivation thereof; 
  -- regulations based on the economic requirements of tracked 
vehicle use in the tundra zone; accelerated development and 
production of special regional equipment that does not disrupt 
the North's soil and vegetative cover (using pneumatic treads, 
air cushions, and so on); 
  -- development and implementation of a comprehensive program 
to protect Russian Chernozem soils from degradation and restore 
their fertility; 
  -- preparation of recommendations of ways to improve 
regional 
organization and structure in order to create sustainable and 
self-regulating landscapes; 
  -- development and implementation of technological complexes 
employing special machinery for recultivation work and efforts 
to increase the productivity of low-productivity agricultural 
land; 
  -- establishment of a hybridization center to develop new, 
improved strains of plants for use in the recultivation of 
disrupted and polluted land and in increasing the productivity 
of low-productivity and degraded agricultural land; 
  -- development of handbooks of informational, normative, and 
technological materials on recultivation of disrupted land and 
protection of land resources during mining operations; 
  -- development of criteria and methodology for environmental 
economic assessment of the anthropogenic effects of industrial 
and other enterprises on land resources, as well as a 
methodology for environmental economic assessment of the 
operations of existing enterprises and planning of new 
enterprises. 
  The Government of the Russian Federation has developed and 
approved a State Program for Land Monitoring in the Russian 
Federation (Russian Federation Government Decree No. 100, issued 
5 February 1993) for the purpose of gradual introduction of land 
monitoring in the Russian Federation; this will include a system 
of observations on the condition of land for the purpose of 
timely identification of changes, assessment of those changes, 
and warnings and identification of the effects of negative 
processes. 
  This program makes provision for: 
  -- creation of a base of legal standards and scientific 
methodology for land monitoring; 
  -- a landscape and environmental classification of Russia's 
territory, including identification of areas of occurrence of 
the principal negative processes, broken down by type and by the 
degree of their effect on the land's condition; 
  -- creation of a land monitoring information bank; 
  -- improvement of existing and introduction of new methods 
of 
technical means and technologies for land monitoring; 
  -- creation of organizational structures for land 
monitoring. 
<H6>  5.1.4. Underground Resources and Mineral Resources </H6>
  For many years there have been high levels of losses 
connected with the underground mining of coal (23.5 
percent)--including coking coal (20.9 percent)--chrome ore (27.7 
percent) and potassium salts (62.5 percent). 
  The state suffers serious harm from the loss of valuable 
components and incomplete refining of minerals once they are 
mined. For example, more than one-third of all tin and 
approximately one-fourth of all iron, tungsten, molybdenum, 
potassium oxide, and phosphorus pentoxide are currently lost in 
the process of ore enrichment. Furthermore, losses during the 
enrichment process exceed losses connected with mining by a 
factor of seven for iron and by a factor of five for tungsten 
and tin. 
  Serious harm is done by enterprises' desire to selectively 
work the best sections of deposits, resulting in the 
accumulation of stockpiles of low-quality minerals and loss of 
their industrial significance. 
  The legal and economic foundations of complete and efficient 
utilization and protection of underground resources are set 
forth in the Russian Federation law ``On Underground 
Resources.'' That law (Section 1, p 3) states that determination 
of the strategy for use of, the rate of reproduction of, and the 
further expansion and improvement in quality of the mineral raw 
materials base is to be made based on development and 
implementation of federal programs. 
  In order to achieve efficient utilization of mineral 
resources, it is essential: 
  -- to develop and enact ``Regulations for the Protection of 
the Environment in Connection With Underground Resource Use''; 
  -- to develop and implement measures to improve the 
management of the state's underground resources. When licenses 
are issued to use underground resources, highly efficient use of 
those resources and protection of the environment by the 
underground resource users must be ensured; 
  -- to carry out an inventory and reevaluation of reserves 
for 
the 25-30 most important types of minerals, taking into 
consideration the latest advances in equipment and technologies 
for the mining and processing of minerals, stricter 
environmental protection requirements, and changes in prices for 
the products of the mining sectors of the economy; 
  -- to implement a series of measures to ensure efficient and 
complete utilization of mineral deposits, including development 
and introduction of mineral mining equipment and technologies 
that produce the maximum possible and most economically feasible 
level of mineral extraction, a transition to comprehensive 
technological approaches to development of deposits, expansion 
of the spectrum of usable components produced through in-depth 
processing of mined minerals, and achievement of complete 
utilization and use of wastes from the mining and mineral 
refining industries; 
  -- to lay the scientific groundwork and create a base of 
laws 
and standards and an economic mechanism to provide incentives 
for the efficient and environmentally safe development of the 
underground realm, including projects for possible 
nontraditional uses of exhausted mines for the benefit of the 
economy; 
  -- to conduct comprehensive geo-ecological monitoring of the 
environment for the purpose of laying the groundwork for its 
efficient use and preservation and the protection of areas from 
dangerous and catastrophic natural and technogenic effects; 
  -- to conduct a geological, technological, and economic 
assessment of technogenic deposits; 
  -- to develop and make the transition to new economic 
relations between geological survey organizations and 
enterprises in the mining industry; 
  -- to ban operations by enterprises that mine and refine 
minerals but are not equipped with the technical means for 
recording and monitoring the quantity and quality of the mineral 
raw materials mined, refined, or lost by them. 
<H6>  5.1.5. Specially Protected Natural Areas </H6>
  Specially protected natural areas in the Russian Federation 
form a unified functional system that is set aside for the 
preservation and study of natural diversity and supports 
ecological diversity and the conducting of environmental 
monitoring. 
  The territory of specially protected areas is distributed as 
follows. Preserves occupy 1.2 percent of the country's 
territory, reserves another 2 percent, and national parks 0.2 
percent. 
  In order to ensure inexhaustible use of animal and plant 
life, a program must be developed to preserve and restore the 
species diversity of flora and fauna and to preserve the biota's 
genetic stock. 
  That program must include: 
  -- development and implementation of a program to establish 
a 
system of specially protected natural areas, with provision for 
an increase by 1995 in the area of preserves by 18.8 million 
hectares and national natural parks by 12 million hectares, and 
by the year 2000 by another 5.8 million hectares and 6.3 million 
hectares, respectively. This will bring their totals (including 
existing areas) to 51.6 million hectares (3.3 percent of the 
republic's total area) by 1995 and to 63.7 million (3.7 percent) 
by 2000; 
  -- focusing of the management of nature preserves, national 
parks, and reserves of federal significance in a single organ, 
the Russian Ministry of Environmental Protection and Natural 
Resources; 
  -- expansion of the rights and functions of preserve and 
national park staff to ensure effective protection of 
preservation areas; 
  -- establishment of a state planning and survey service to 
organize specially protected natural areas; 
  -- provision of directed funding for research in the field 
of 
preserve management, allocation of the necessary budget funding 
for the planning, establishment, and development of newly 
organized state preserves, national parks, and reserves of 
republic-wide significance; 
  -- determination of a procedure for the organization of 
national parks, assignment of capital investment limits to them, 
and allocation of physical, technical, and financial resources 
to them; 
  -- development of indices by which to assess the results of 
operations by national parks and state preserves; 
  -- study of the interaction between national parks and other 
land users to organize the protection and efficient use and 
reproduction of natural resources and to provide cultural, 
household, and information services and environmental education 
to the public; 
  -- creation of a unified central data base on the dynamics 
of 
natural processes throughout the entire territory of the 
republic within the unified Chronicle of Nature information 
retrieval system. 
<H6>  5.1.6. Forests, Flora, and Fauna </H6>
  One of the most important problems in the ecological balance 
is the restoration of forests. In the Russian Federation, forest 
restoration efforts are being carried out to an extent that 
exceeds the amount of clearcutting currently being done. In 1991 
Russia cut 1.417 million hectares of forest, and replanted 
forests on an area of 1.562 million hectares. According to 
foresters' estimates, reforestation needs to be done on 1.276 
million hectares. However, in a number of oblasts and republics 
the quality and effectiveness of reforestation efforts are low. 
Moreover, due to the use of equipment and technologies by the 
timber industry in recent years that result in the virtually 
complete destruction of the forest ecosystem, large amounts of 
new growth and young trees of valuable species are dying in 
Russia's mixed forest zone, and undesirable species replacement 
is occurring. 
  In accordance with a decree issued by the RSFSR Council of 
Ministers on 16 March 1990, No. 93, ``On Urgent Measures To 
Improve the Environmental Situation in the RSFSR in 1990-95 and 
Principal Focuses of Environmental Protection in the 13th 
Five-Year Plan and the Period up to the Year 2005,'' in 1990 the 
RSFSR Ministry of Forestry drew up a ``State Program for 
Reforestation in Russia in the Period up to the Year 2005.'' By 
decision of the Russian Government (in a protocol issued on 28 
September 1992, No VM-P42-31), the Forest Committee under the 
Russian Ministry of Environmental Protection, the Russian 
Ministry of Economics, the Russian Ministry of Finance, and the 
Russian Ministry of Agriculture were directed to amend that 
program, with consideration for current legislation and the 
transition to market relationships. When amended, the program 
will specify the amount of work to be done and the physical, 
technical, and financial resources that work will entail. 
  Successful reproduction of forests can be achieved only on 
the basis of close interconnection and a balance among 
technological processes used in cutting, reforestation, 
cultivation of timber stands, and organization of effective 
conservation and protection of forests, combined with 
appropriate scientific support and physical and technical 
supplies. A lack of balance in any measure will result in the 
inefficient functioning of the entire system. 
  Implementation of this state program will include: 
  -- reduction in the amount of clearcutting, replacing it 
with 
selective and gradual harvesting, and efforts to ensure that 
forestry requirements are complied with in the process of timber 
harvesting; 
  -- establishment of a forest ecology monitoring service, 
particularly in regions with a high concentration of enterprises 
in the nonferrous and ferrous metals industries and the chemical 
and petrochemical industries, as well as regions with 
radioactively contaminated forests, the Lake Baikal watershed, 
the Far Eastern Region, and other regions where there exists a 
real danger of disruption in the environmental balance; 
  -- an increase in the effectiveness of reforestation 
efforts, 
the survival rate and quality of artificially created stands, 
targeted reforestation of stands of oak, beech, cedar, and 
others of the most valuable tree species, and expansion of 
special-purpose tree farming; 
  -- creation of protective forest plantings to prevent water 
and wind erosion; reconstruction and repair of previously 
established protective stands; 
  -- preservation of the current levels of timber harvesting 
and young tree stand thinning, coupled with improvement of 
quality and improvement in the means of conducting such harvests; 
  -- development of transportation access to forests and an 
increase in the amount of repair and maintenance work on 
existing forest drainage systems; 
  -- improvement of forest seed production and nursery farming 
based on production of high-quality seeds and selection of 
planting materials; 
  -- improvement in methods of protecting the forest against 
insect pests and diseases, with an emphasis on the use of 
biological methods and means, tighter monitoring of occurrences 
of insect infestations and diseases, and improvement in 
ground-based forest protection equipment. 
  During the period in question, the volume of work in 
connection with forest reproduction is planned at the 1992 
level, or with a slight increase by 1995. 
  As a result of implementation of this program, during this 
period the Forest Committee will carry out forest restoration 
over an area of 2.53 million hectares, including plantings of 
cedar forest on 92,000 hectares and oak on 56,000 hectares. A 
total of 6.5 million hectares will come of age and be 
reclassified as commercial stands of young timber. 
  Due to a protracted drought in a number of regions of Russia 
this year, there has been a marked increase in the incidence of 
forest fires. A significant contributing factor to the 
inadequate level of forest protection against fires was the 
chronic shortage of budget allocations for such purposes, the 
poor physical and technical infrastructure of forest 
firefighting services, and sharp increases in the cost of 
leasing aircraft and the prices of physical resources and 
equipment. 
  In order to improve protection against forest fires, and in 
compliance with Russian Government Decree No. 254, issued on 28 
July 1992, the Forest Committee, in conjunction with other 
affected ministries and agencies, has developed a program to 
protect forests from fire in 1993-97. 
  That program makes provision for: 
  -- reinforcement of existing airborne and ground-based 
forest 
firefighting services, plus creation of new units for the rapid 
detection and extinguishing of forest fires, with those units to 
be provided with physical and technical resources in line with 
scientifically established standards; 
  -- establishment of special mobile units in regions with 
large areas of forest to fight major forest fires, those units 
to be equipped with all-terrain firefighting equipment and the 
means of transporting it; 
  -- accelerated development of designs and manufacture of 
tanker aircraft to fight forest fires directly from the air; 
  -- development and introduction of space-based information 
support for forest fire protection efforts and monitoring of the 
forest fire situation, as well as a system for detecting and 
providing up-to-date information on fires as they occur, along 
with other operational information; 
  -- establishment of a computer network and communications 
system of unified interagency dispatcher stations for ongoing 
management of forest fire prevention; 
  -- allocation of budget funding for the operating expenses 
and centralized capital investment required for air- and 
ground-based forest protection. 
  In order to protect and efficiently utilize plant and animal 
resources, it is essential: 
  -- to develop and perfect legislative foundations, 
standards, 
and regulations for the protection and reproduction of animal 
life and regulation of hunting, and to define measures to 
increase penalties for violations of the requirements thus 
established; 
  -- to create an effective system for the protection and use 
of plants (including forests) and animal life (including fish 
resources); 
  -- to continue to develop and perfect methods for the 
comprehensive management of forestry, hunting, and fishing; 
  -- to conduct an inventory of and map the habitats of rare 
and endangered plant and animal species, and to create and 
expand existing genetic banks; 
  -- to set environmentally justified limits on the 
procurement 
(harvesting) of wild medicinal and food products from the forest 
and on the basis thereof to organize the industrial use and 
reproduction of those resources; 
  -- to provide state record keeping and state cadastral 
mapping of plant and animal resources and to maintain the 
Russian Red Book on a qualitatively new level, with 
consideration for the economic independence of republics and 
regions; 
  -- to implement a series of measures to prevent 
desertification and degradation of steppe vegetation; 
  -- to expand the network of botanical preserves, genetic 
reserves, and preserves for distinctive forest boundaries and 
mast-producing areas; 
  -- to develop and establish a new procedure for the 
creation, 
expansion, and storage of botanical and zoological collections; 
  -- to develop and introduce a system of economic, legal, and 
ecological standards for the use of plants; 
  -- to develop and put in practice a new economic mechanism 
for regulation of the use of animal resources, defining a 
procedure for assigning hunting lands on a lease basis and 
issuing all types of permits for the rights to use animal 
resources; 
  -- to continue the study of the effects of animal activities 
on the formation of biological and geological cenoses, conduct a 
classification by landscape type, and on the basis thereof 
determine the optimum density and number of wild animals for 
each region, as well as limits and quotas on their removal; 
  -- to ensure monitoring of compliance with international and 
interrepublic programs and conventions to protect rare and 
endangered migratory animals and plants, and to develop foreign 
economic relations in that area of activity; 
  -- to continue to improve methods of surveying rare and 
particularly valuable types of animals in the wild, with their 
subsequent reintroduction into nature and implementation of 
measures to make broad practical use of these methods; 
  -- to make fuller use of advances in science and technology 
and the system of aerial and space observation of the 
distribution and migrations of wild animals, in particular 
saiga, wild northern reindeer, and other large hoofed animals, 
sea mammals, and waterfowl; 
  -- to develop fishing in Russia's internal bodies of water, 
to increase the effectiveness of efforts to protect and 
reproduce fish populations, to increase the release of fry of 
valuable commercial fish species into natural bodies of water 
and reservoirs, and to establish fish hatcheries capable of 
producing more than 340 million fry annually. 
<H6>  5.1.7. Resorts and Other Recreational Areas </H6>
  In order to preserve the therapeutic and curative functions 
of naturally occurring natural sites, it is essential: 
  -- to restrict economic activities in the vicinity of 
resorts 
and unique recreational areas and to remove from those zones 
enterprises that are not connected with the functioning and 
development of resorts and therapeutic facilities or with public 
services, while ensuring the most favorable sanitary conditions 
for therapy and recreation; 
  -- to develop in the 1993-94 period scientifically based 
criteria for maximum permissible anthropogenic burden on the 
environment of resort and recreational areas; 
  -- to ensure by 1995 the development of regional 
comprehensive plans for environmental protection at resorts of 
republic-wide significance; 
  -- to set up a system for monitoring the state of natural 
therapeutic resources, landscapes, bodies of water, the air, 
soil, and vegetation; 
  -- to develop a cadastral map of areas in Russia that are of 
recreational significance; 
  -- to develop an economic and legal mechanism to regulate 
the 
recreational use of nature (accelerated amortization of fixed 
capital at recreational sites and facilities, special 
requirements governing development of natural recreational 
resources, and policy on personnel, prices, and taxes). 
<H6>  5.2. Urgent Measures To Bring About Environmental 
Restoration of Russia's Regions </H6>
  The most important goal of environmental restoration in the 
Russian Federation is to reduce the worsening conflicts between 
the siting and condition of production facilities and the 
sustainability of the natural development of ecosystems at 
various levels. 
  One important element in solving environmental problems in 
the region is to ensure the natural development of individual 
ecosystems and preserve unique natural complexes and landscapes. 
This will necessitate the development of environmental 
regulations governing natural resource use at the regional and 
territorial levels, with assignment of a priority classification 
to a given region's ecosystems, unique natural complexes, and 
landscapes. 
<H6>  5.2.1. The Volga-North Caspian Region </H6>
  The Volga-North Caspian Region consists of 32 oblasts and 
republics in the Volga Region. 
  The environmental situation in this region is hallmarked by 
a 
combination of a significant quantity of anthropogenic factors 
influencing the environment and the functional activities of the 
environment's components. The Volga-Caspian basin has a 
predominance of industries that produce the most toxic wastes 
and have ineffective treatment facilities. The most harmful 
types of production are enterprises and associations in the 
chemical, oil and gas refining, cellulose and paper industries, 
the fertilizer and pharmaceutical industries, and so on. 
  Many industrial enterprises have mostly outdated technology, 
resulting in the creation of large amounts of liquid, solid, and 
gaseous wastes. 
  The particularly complex environmental situation in the 
Volga 
watershed has necessitated the development of a program entitled 
``Amelioration of the Environmental Situation and Increase in 
Resource and Economic Potential in the Volga Watershed (Revival 
of the Volga).'' 
  This program makes provision for: 
  -- development and implementation of a series of radical 
measures to bring about a substantial reduction in the release 
of pollutants into the environment, lowering of atmospheric 
emissions to permissible levels, and discontinuation of polluted 
waste water discharges into bodies of water; 
  -- development and approval in 1993 of a program on the 
construction of facilities for the thorough removal of biogenic 
elements from waste water and implementation of other measures 
to combat the eutrophication of bodies of water in the 
watershed, with consideration for advanced foreign and Russian 
experience in this field; 
  -- construction in the 1993-95 period of enterprises and 
facilities for the utilization, neutralization, and disposal of 
toxic industrial, household, and other wastes with capital 
investment funds allocated for the development of those sectors 
of the economy, as well as expansion and renovation of existing 
facilities using associations', enterprises', and organizations' 
own funds; 
  -- further development of economic facilities in the Volga 
River watershed, primarily through conservation of water 
resources and a significant reduction in water use per unit of 
product manufactured; 
  -- completion in 1994 of the outfitting of all water 
collection and water discharge installations and devices in the 
region with modern means of recording water use; 
  -- implementation of a series of efforts to reduce areas 
with 
low water levels, create water protection belts (zones), 
reinforce riverbanks, and improve the condition of agricultural 
land in areas adjoining reservoirs, as well as measures to 
protect Nizhniy Novgorod from flooding and land slippage; 
  -- manufacture of special vessels and other technical means 
for the rapid cleanup of accidental spills of petroleum and 
other pollutants, with provision of those vessels and technical 
means to water transportation enterprises in the 1993-95 period; 
  -- development and manufacture of tankers and other vessels 
for use in the Volga-Caspian watershed with designs that will 
prevent spills of petroleum products and other environmentally 
hazardous substances in the event of accidents involving vessels 
carrying such cargos; 
  -- clarification of regulations governing ship traffic and 
permissible traffic volume along specific sections of the river, 
with the objective of reducing the adverse effects of ship 
traffic on bodies of water and optimizing cargo transportation; 
  -- acceptance in full by departmental transshipment 
stations, 
storage depots, and oil storage facilities of oil and petroleum 
products collected during cleanup efforts following oil spills, 
garbage, ballast water, and bilgewater for subsequent treatment 
and utilization, beginning in 1993; 
  -- development and implementation of measures to lower the 
level of pollution in bodies of water and of other harmful 
effects on the environment during channel-dredging work on 
rivers in the Volga-Caspian watershed; 
  -- implementation in the 1993-95 period of a series of 
organizational, economic, agrotechnical, forest improvement, and 
hydraulic engineering measures to end erosion processes and 
water pollution by the products of soil erosion, pesticides, and 
chemical fertilizer, to fundamentally improve the condition of 
the land and to provide scientifically based regulation of 
livestock pasturage and carry out vegetation improvement and 
other measures to prevent desertification of pastureland in land 
along the Caspian Sea and to restore the productivity of such 
land; 
  -- development and implementation of measures to restore and 
improve the condition of plant and animal life in areas 
adjoining the Caspian Sea, as well as along the lower reaches of 
the Volga River; 
  -- a substantial increase in the 1993-95 period in the 
amount 
of work done to improve the condition of small rivers, strict 
compliance with regulations governing water protection zones, 
and complete cessation of land cultivation in water protection 
zones along rivers and other bodies of water in the 
Volga-Caspian watershed; 
  -- consideration and resolution in the 1993-95 period of 
issues pertaining to expansion of preservation zones along the 
Volga River and establishment of a system of biological reserves 
in those zones, with priority development of fishing and 
restrictions on other types of economic activity; 
  -- restrictions on the filling of reservoirs at the 
Nizhnekamsk Hydroelectric Power Station and the Cheboksary 
Hydroelectric Power Station, in order to reduce losses of 
agricultural land and prevent other adverse effects on the 
environment in the vicinity of those reservoirs; 
  -- changes in regulations governing the use of water 
resources in reservoirs along the Volga-Kama chain of 
hydroelectric power stations in view of the need to create more 
favorable conditions for intensive development of fishing and 
the reproduction of fish populations; 
  -- equipping of all water diversion and water discharge 
facilities in water collection and drainage systems with 
effective fish protection devices in the 1993-95 period; 
  -- conducting during the 1993-94 period of in-depth research 
on the restoration and stabilization of ecological systems and 
realization of measures necessary to preserve and restore 
populations of sturgeon and other valuable fish species; 
  -- efforts toward comprehensive reconstruction of rice 
cultivation and irrigation systems in the Volga-Caspian 
watershed in order to eliminate completely the discharge of 
polluted runoff into fishing areas by 1995; 
  -- completion in the 1993-95 period of measures to increase 
water supply in the Akhtuba River and improve the state of fish 
spawning grounds in the Volga-Akhtuba watershed. 
<H6>  5.2.2. The Baltic Sea Basin </H6>
  In accordance with the Convention on Protection of the 
Marine 
Environment in the Baltic Sea Region (1974 and 1992), various 
declarations (1988, 1990, and 1992), the Convention on 
Long-Distance Cross-Border Air Pollution (1979), the 
intergovernmental Soviet-Finnish Agreement on Cooperation in the 
Field of Environmental Protection (1985), urgent measures 
stemming from Russia's obligations, and the Declaration on 
Revival of the Baltic Sea (1990), and in order to restore the 
normal ecological balance, it will be necessary to draw up a 
comprehensive joint program of environmental measures in the 
Baltic Sea basin. 
  That program will include: 
  -- a halt to discharges of untreated or inadequately treated 
waste water, achieving a 50 percent reduction in the release of 
organic substances, nitrogen and phosphorus compounds, salts, 
and heavy metals into bodies of water by 1995; 
  -- completion by 1994 of construction of a series of 
treatment facilities and sewage networks in St. Petersburg, 
Kaliningrad, Petrozavodsk, Pskov, and other cities for the 
purpose of complete biological purification of waste water, with 
establishment of local treatment facilities at enterprises. 
Construction should begin on a system of storm sewer lines with 
waste water routed to treatment facilities. Also slated for 
construction are facilities to provide additional treatment of 
waste water and a high degree of purification from nitrogen and 
phosphorus compounds, and secondary use of this additionally 
purified water in cities and by industrial enterprises; 
  -- implementation by 1995 of a program to protect the 
environment at enterprises in the timber, cellulose, and paper 
industries in the Republic of Karelia, Leningrad Oblast, and 
Kaliningrad Oblast, eliminating discharges of untreated waste 
water and reducing pollutant emissions into the atmosphere; 
  -- development and gradual introduction by 1995 of 
environmentally safe methods of agriculture and use of food 
industry facilities that will preclude adverse effects on water 
protection zones and the release of production- and 
livestock-related waste water, organic and chemical fertilizers, 
and toxic chemicals into bodies of water; 
  -- reconstruction of docks and cargo handling facilities at 
ports, to ensure environmental safety in connection with their 
operations; 
  -- development of methods of air- and ship-based long-range 
monitoring of the state of the marine environment, with the goal 
of quickly detecting pollution sources and initiating steps to 
eliminate them; 
  -- participation in the creation of a unified international 
system to monitor the condition of the Baltic Sea, along with 
development and implementation of a unified program to improve 
the environmental situation in the Baltic Sea basin; 
  -- development and approval of a statute on Lake Ladoga as a 
natural site of national significance; 
  -- development and gradual introduction by 1995 of a system 
to regulate natural resource use in the Lake Ladoga watershed, 
with consideration for the natural and economic characteristics 
of the region in question, the acuteness of the environmental 
situation, and international environmental quality standards; 
  -- development of a program to make industrial production in 
the Lake Ladoga watershed more environmentally sound; 
  -- development of an environmentally justified strategy for 
socioeconomic development in the Lake Ladoga watershed, with the 
goal of bringing the structure and distribution of production 
facilities into accordance with the natural resource potential 
of the region in question and reducing the acuteness of the 
environmental situation. 
<H6>  5.2.3. The Sea of Azov Basin </H6>
  As a result of flow regulation along the Don and Kuban 
Rivers, intensive irrigation, and large volumes of permanently 
diverted water use, the influx of fresh water into the Sea of 
Azov has decreased by as much as 65 percent as compared to the 
average annual flow of its tributaries, and this has resulted in 
a change in the water balance and caused an increase in the 
sea's salinity from 10 to 14 percent. As a result, there has 
been a change in the species composition of fish populations and 
food organisms, with valuable fish species being replaced by 
less valuable ones. Increasing contamination of the marine 
environment has resulted in the accumulation of pollutants in 
aquatic biotas and has created a real possibility that the 
genetic stock of fish populations in the Sea of Azov will be 
lost. 
  In view of the extremely acute environmental situation in 
the 
Sea of Azov basin and the negative ecological processes 
occurring in it, processes that threaten to lead to irreversible 
changes, it is necessary to implement: 
  -- during the 1993-95 period, a series of environmental 
protection measures to prevent pollution of bodies of water, 
conserve water, and reduce permanent diversion of water in order 
to halt completely all discharges of contaminated waste water by 
1995 and ensure an average annual flow of at least 34 cubic 
kilometers of fresh water into the Sea of Azov; 
  -- during the 1993-95 period, efforts to improve in a 
comprehensive manner the condition of small rivers, restore in 
all areas a system of water protection zones, and ensure 
compliance with that system, and beginning in 1993 halt the 
cultivation of lands in water protection strips adjacent to 
bodies of water; 
  -- planting in the 1993-95 period of artificial forest areas 
on nonproducing areas of forest land and unused agricultural 
land; completion of efforts to create protective forest stands 
to prevent erosion processes; 
  -- reduction in harmful emissions into the atmosphere in 
1996 
in cities and industrial centers along the Sea of Azov 
coast--Rostov-na-Donu, Taganrog, Novocherkessk, Krasnodar, and 
others--according to established standards, plus construction in 
the 1993-95 period of enterprises and facilities for the 
utilization, neutralization, and disposal of toxic industrial, 
household, and other wastes; 
  -- broad introduction beginning in 1993 of circulatory water 
use and other environmental protection measures within rice 
irrigation systems in order to halt the release of runoff water 
that is contaminated with pesticides and chemical fertilizers 
into bodies of water; 
  -- termination in 1994 of the use of pesticides to cultivate 
rice fields in Krasnodar and Stavropol Krays and Rostov Oblast, 
development and introduction of scientifically based zonal soil 
protection and water-conservation systems for use in 
agriculture, with provision made for restrictions on and 
subsequent banning of pesticides, and introduction of biological 
methods of protecting plants from pests and diseases; expansion 
of selection efforts to create disease- and pest-resistant rice 
strains; 
  -- a halt to the construction of new irrigation systems 
until 
such time as existing systems have been rebuilt to increase 
their efficiency; 
  -- installation of fish protection devices on all water 
collection and water discharge installations on collection and 
drainage systems; 
  -- development of a system for the comprehensive use and 
protection of water and land resources in the basin of the Sea 
of Azov, with priority attention to urgent matters pertaining to 
restoration of the ecological and sanitary situation; 
  -- implementation of a program of bank-reinforcement work, 
with the establishment if necessary of a specialized 
organization for the realization thereof, as well as the 
development and introduction by 1995 of environmentally safe 
channel-dredging work; 
  -- during the 1993-94 period, equipping of all ports in the 
Sea of Azov basin with equipment to receive and treat 
commercial, household, and industrial waste water from ships, 
establishment of a service to eliminate spills of petroleum 
products and other substances, and equipping of that service 
with oil and garbage collectors, oil booms, and other essential 
equipment; 
  -- research and development work aimed at preventing the 
dispersal in the Sea of Azov basin of hydrobiont species that 
are not appropriate to that ecosystem; 
  -- study on the issue creating specially protected fishing 
preserves in the Gulf of Taganrog and in the estuaries and 
deltas of the Don and Kuban Rivers. 
  In view of the fact that the Republic of Ukraine discharges 
more than 1 billion cubic meters of polluted waste water into 
the Sea of Azov basin, or 24 percent of the total amount of 
polluted discharge in that basin, it is essential that an 
agreement be reached with the Republic of Ukraine in 1993 
regarding coordinated measures to reduce the discharge or 
emission of pollutants to established levels by 1995. 
<H6>  5.2.4. The Black Sea Coast </H6>
  In accordance with the Convention on Protection of the Black 
Sea From Pollution (1992), and in order to bring about radical 
improvement in the environmental situation in that region, it is 
essential: 
  -- to ensure an annual increase in the amount of 
shore-reinforcement and antislippage efforts, in order to 
essentially achieve shoreline stabilization in the resort region 
by 1995; 
  -- to implement a series of measures to reduce air pollution 
by vehicle exhaust to established levels and to establish 
monitoring and regulatory stations, equipping them with the 
necessary equipment and instruments; 
  -- to halt the excavation of sand and gravel in coastal 
waters and from riverbeds in 1993; 
  -- to develop, with consideration for a prior inventory, a 
scientifically based concept for the socioeconomic development 
of the Black Sea coast resort zone in Krasnodar Kray, 
determining the levels of optimum and maximum recreational 
burden on its natural therapeutic resources; 
  -- to implement urgent measures to stop environmental 
pollution by the Tuapse Transshipment Oil Depot, and also to 
increase deliveries of lead-free gasolines to resort cities for 
use in automobiles and other means of transportation, in order 
to make a full transition to that type of fuel possible in 1993; 
  -- to equip port facilities with equipment to receive and 
treat waste water from ships; 
  -- to build and put on line in the 1993-95 period facilities 
to treat: storm sewer runoff in the cities of Sochi, Tuapse, 
Anapa, and Gelendzhik; deep-sea releases of waste water from the 
city of Tuapse in 1993; and the same in the cities of Sochi, 
Novorossiysk, Gelendzhik, and Anapa in 1995; 
  -- to reduce discharges of biogenic substances by 50 percent 
by 1995, and then to halt completely the discharge of polluted 
waste water into bodies of water in the Black Sea basin; 
  -- to create a system of water supply and sewers by 1995 
that 
will be fully capable of meeting demand for water and sewage 
management in the cities of Sochi, Tuapse, Gelendzhik, 
Novorossiysk, and Anapa and in resort towns; 
  -- to continue construction of a highway to bypass downtown 
Sochi, renovation of individual sections of the state highway 
connecting Novorossiysk, Tbilisi, and Baku, and renovation of 
transportation hubs within city limits; 
  -- to ban in all areas as of 1993 the use of bottom trawls 
in 
commercial fishing, as these have an adverse effect on aquatic 
biocenoses; 
  -- to expand the network of specially protected bodies of 
water and their adjacent territories in the Black Sea basin, 
particularly in the vicinity of Cape Tarkhankut and the Gulf of 
Karkinit; 
  -- to assess effects on the Black Sea ecosystem by 
hydrobionts accidentally introduced into the Black Sea basin and 
draft recommendations on preventing their negative effects on 
the sea's characteristic fauna; 
  -- to do research on the dynamics of the Black Sea's 
condition under the influence of anthropogenic pollution and 
variations in the level of the hydrogen sulfide layer, and based

Necessary measures must be taken to involve states along the 
Danube River and the Black Sea Coast as well as international 
organizations in these efforts. 
<H6>  5.2.5. The Arctic Region </H6>
  Construction of waste water treatment facilities is 
proceeding extremely slowly in this region and is not keeping 
pace with increasing volumes of industrial and housing 
construction. Goals for the construction of water protection 
facilities are not being met in a satisfactory manner. 
Enterprises and organizations located in this region are not 
carrying out measures to minimize their volume of untreated 
waste water, are doing little to introduce progressive 
production technology, and have been too slow in resolving 
problems pertaining to the complete processing of raw materials 
and utilization of waste products. 
  The necessity of solving the North's environmental problems 
prompted the development of a program entitled ``Protection and 
Efficient Use of Natural Resources in the Russian Arctic.'' 
  In view of the special significance of the Arctic Region in 
the formation of our planet's current climate and in determining 
the level of the ocean, as well as its importance as a source of 
territory and natural resources for the Russian Federation, it 
would be appropriate: 
  -- to classify the Arctic as a natural region under a 
special 
natural use regime; 
  -- to develop regional environmental standards to regulate 
economic activities within coastal and offshore areas, on the 
continental shelf, and in Russia's maritime economic zone; 
  -- to establish through legislation the priority of the 
Arctic's native population's interests when matters pertaining 
to economic use of the region are decided. In order to preserve 
traditional forms of natural resource use, the establishment of 
ethnic territories should begin as of 1993; 
  -- to designate bodies of water and water courses that are 
the principal sources of water supply for population centers (in 
particular this should be done for compact settlements of the 
North's small peoples), and by decisions of local soviets ban 
economic and other activities that could result in pollution of 
those water sources; 
  -- to develop effective methods of recultivating the soil 
and 
vegetative cover of tundra and mixed forest-tundra areas; 
  -- to ensure adequate fire protection for reindeer pasturage 
and forests adjoining the tundra; 
  -- to develop and ensure as of 1993 the manufacture of 
specialized vehicles for survey and exploration work in the 
Arctic, as well as for use by the small peoples of the North to 
engage in their traditional trades, with equal weight 
distribution, which will not cause topsoil disruption; 
  -- to shift heating of rural population centers in the 
Arctic 
zone to briquetted coal, gas, or liquid fuel that will eliminate 
the use of firewood in the forest tundra zone; 
  -- to end log drives, making the transition to 
transportation 
of timber logged on the upper reaches of rivers solely by ship 
by 1995; 
  -- to define routes and zones for the development of 
tourism, 
in order to prevent disruption of natural environments; 
  -- to step up efforts in connection with the planning, 
industrial production, and introduction into use of 
environmentally clean wind-power installations to provide heat 
and electricity to population centers; 
  -- to eliminate piles of timber and mud along the routes of 
oil and gas pipelines and to clean up and recultivate such 
areas, with subsequent transfer thereof to land users in amounts 
and for time periods agreed upon with local bodies; 
  -- to establish facilities for the utilization and 
neutralization of household waste, and to build crossing points 
across mainline gas pipelines that intersect the migration 
routes of wild animals; 
  -- to build, expand, and renovate fish farming facilities 
designed to compensate for damages done to fish populations in 
the Arctic watershed; 
  -- to develop and organize production of equipment to 
contain 
and collect oil from water surfaces in order to fully supply 
such equipment by 1995 to enterprises and organizations located 
in the region; 
  -- to accelerate construction of facilities to utilize 
by-product petroleum gas; to develop and introduce technical 
means of eliminating sediments contaminated by heavy oil 
fractions; 
  -- to develop and arrange for production of a necessary 
quantity of effective technical means to remove oil pollution 
from soil, and by 1996 widely introduce microbiological methods 
of fighting oil pollution in soils. 
<H6>  5.2.6. The Caucasus Mineral Waters </H6>
  In accordance with Russian Federation Government Decree No. 
462, issued on 6 July 1992, the administration of the Caucasus 
Mineral Waters was assigned to develop in conjunction with the 
Russian Ministry of Health and the Russia Ministry of Ecology 
[as published] a long-range state program on the commercial and 
residential development of the specially protected ecological 
and resort region known as the Caucasus Mineral Waters. That 
program must make provision for: 
  -- removal of industrial and agricultural enterprises under 
ministry and agency control from residential and resort zones in 
the region; 
  -- amendment of the general plans of resort cities in the 
Caucasus Mineral Waters, an increase in the level of 
organizational work to implement those plans and make efficient 
use of the territory of those cities, with the goal of maximum 
improvement in the conditions of treatment, recreation, and 
residence for working people and preservation of natural 
therapeutic resources; 
  -- development of a comprehensive regional plan to protect 
the environment at resorts in the Caucasus Mineral Waters, 
making that plan the basis for implementation of the 
environmental protection and sanitation improvement measures set 
forth in plans for economic and social development; 
  -- creation of a unified water supply system for resort 
cities based on underground water resources known to exist in 
the Malka Aquifer; 
  -- elimination of nonfunctional wells and removal of animal 
farms and complexes from the second sanitary zone surrounding 
resorts; 
  -- an end to the discharge of used mineral water and other 
untreated waste water into any bodies of water; 
  -- structural reorganization of the sanitarium and resort 
complex; 
  -- transformation of the Caucasus Mineral Waters into an 
international resort center through creation of an appropriate 
legal mechanism to attract foreign investment. 
<H6>  5.2.7. The Lake Baykal Watershed </H6>
  Lake Baykal is a unique natural landmark, and its problems 
have attracted the close attention of the public in our country 
and around the world. Despite the fact that the Lake Baykal 
watershed as a whole is not among the regions with an acute 
environmental situation, the lake ecosystem's sensitivity to 
external influences is so great that there is a threat of 
dangerous trends changing its basic elements, and that demands 
immediate action. However, a reduction in individual adverse 
effects cannot fundamentally change dangerous trends toward 
change in the environment. That will require radical structural 
change in environmental protection efforts. Without making a 
radical change in the existing ecological and economic systems 
in the region and lessening the adverse connections and 
functions which both directly and indirectly continue to harm 
the environment, the country will be forced to invest an ever 
larger portion of its gross national product in stabilization of 
the environment and preservation of the conditions necessary for 
life in the Baykal region. 
  In view of the above, and also in compliance with Russian 
Presidential Edict No 295, issued on 25 March 1992 under the 
title ``On Urgent Measures of State Support for the Economy of 
the Buryat SSR'' (point 11), a Comprehensive Program for the 
Protection and Efficient Use of Natural Resources in the Lake 
Baykal Watershed (Basic Aspects) has been developed. 
  That program contains plans to ensure: 
  -- creation of an environmental monitoring system; 
  -- establishment of a regional economic mechanism to ensure 
protection for and efficient use of natural resources; 
  -- greater emphasis on the environment in physical 
production 
through use of low-resource, low-waste, and no-waste 
technological processes and highly efficient water supply 
systems and methods of purifying waste water and emissions of 
dust and gases; 
  -- closure or restructuring of enterprises that are 
particularly hazardous to the environment into safe or 
environmentally tolerable types of production, implementation of 
technical refitting and renovation on the basis of Russian and 
foreign advances, as well as removal of production facilities 
from the region or their relocation in a more environmentally 
sustainable zone; 
  -- primary use of more environmentally safe types of 
fuel--low-sulfur and low-ash coals, natural gas, and 
electricity--in the shoreline protection zone; centralization of 
heat production, greater use of diesel, and refitting of 
transportation to use unleaded gas or natural gas; 
  -- optimization of the structure of agricultural production, 
reduction of the area of erosion-prone areas cultivated, and 
implementation of anti-erosion measures; 
  -- implementation of measures to reduce runoff of 
pesticides, 
chemical fertilizers, and organic substances from agricultural 
land, gradual reduction in the use of artificial means of plant 
protection, and development of biological methods for that 
purpose; 
  -- recultivation of disrupted land in areas of mining 
operations; 
  -- conducting of a high-quality economic assessment of land 
based on the terms of the land reform now under way and with 
consideration for the need to protect natural sites in the Lake 
Baykal region; 
  -- intensification of environmental protection measures in 
the region's social infrastructure: centralization of the water 
supply and sewage system in cities and urban-type towns, 
construction of garbage processing plants, creation of green 
areas within city boundaries, creation of well-appointed 
recreation zones, and introduction of modern means of treating 
and utilizing municipal and household waste from small 
population centers; 
  -- reestablishment of Lake Baykal's biological resources and 
expansion of fish breeding capacity; 
  -- widespread introduction of scientifically based forms of 
managing hunting, fur farming, and utilization of other forest 
resources; 
  -- directed formation and development of a unified network 
of 
protected areas, encompassing all valuable multipurpose sectors 
of the ecosystem in the Lake Baykal watershed; 
  -- development of a recreational complex, with consideration 
for the requirements of environmental protection for natural 
complexes in the region; 
  -- creation of the necessary environmental conditions for 
the 
activities of the region's population and provision of 
environmentally pure food products; 
  -- creation of a system to reduce the effects of accidents 
and disasters, predict them, and warn the public in a timely 
manner; 
  -- extensive public involvement in matters pertaining to 
environmental protection and efficient natural resource use in 
the Lake Baykal watershed. 
<H3>  Section 6. Basic Principles of the Mechanism for 
Implementation of the National Plan of Action </H3>
  At the present time, there are serious difficulties with the 
implementation of urgent environmental protection measures to 
improve the environmental situation in the Russian Federation. 
  Based on a statement in the Russian Federation law ``On 
Environmental Protection'' (Section 111, Article 17), planning 
of environmental protection measures is carried out as part of 
programs and projections of socioeconomic development on the 
basis of the State Ecological Program and with consideration for 
the natural resource potential of individual regions. 
  The Russian Federation State Ecological Program is a 
unified, 
scientifically based system for the creation and implementation 
of environmental programs at the national, international, and 
regional levels, encompassing solutions to problems at various 
levels with a single comprehensive approach. Thus, the State 
Ecological Program should be viewed as an organizational and 
economic mechanism for the implementation of the National Plan. 
  We must stop the practice of dealing with effects rather 
than 
their causes, of developing measures only to eliminate existing 
environmental emergencies, which are, as a rule, the result of 
ill-conceived natural resource use manifested through the 
unjustified siting of production facilities and use of 
inadequate technologies, as has often been the practice of state 
administrative organs over the past 10-15 years. Therefore, one 
important goal is the use of existing scientific potential to 
develop a comprehensive approach to determining priority areas 
and measures within the appropriate programs, as well as a 
scientifically based state ecological program as the system 
behind those programs. 
  In view of the considerable amount of capital investment 
necessary for implementation of environmental protection 
measures, in compliance with the Russian Federation law ``On 
Environmental Protection'' (Section 111, Article 17, paragraph 
3), those funds must be allocated as a separate item in federal, 
republic, and other budgets. 
  The Russian Federation State Ecological Program should make 
provision for the development of a unit of a general functional 
nature, which will be essential for the implementation of 
environmental programs at various levels. 
  That unit should include the following subprograms: 
  -- monitoring of the environment and sources of influences 
on 
it; ecological mapping; 
  -- establishment of environmental quality standards and 
natural resource use standards; standardization of technological 
processes, facilities, and products; 
  -- an economic and legal mechanism for environmental 
protection and natural resource use; 
  -- a system of state environmental monitoring and 
assessment; 
  -- key areas in the protection and restoration of natural 
environments and the efficient use of Russia's natural resources; 
  -- manufacture of environmental protection equipment and 
installations; 
  -- improvement in the system of environmental education, 
training, and propaganda. 
  Improvement in the ecological condition of the environments 
and ecosystems, and their component natural sites and complexes, 
as well as improved efficiency in natural resource use, should 
be achieved through implementation of programs at various levels 
which take the specific characteristics of industries and 
regions into account, with environmental protection and 
efficient natural resource use possessing the status of state 
priorities. 
  Depending on their objectives, programs may be subdivided 
into: 
  -- comprehensive and of varying territorial extent 
(regional, 
interregional, international, watershed-based, applicable to one 
natural complex, and so on); 
  -- resource-oriented (use and protection of water, soil, 
forests, living resources, and so on); 
  -- economic sector-based (environmental protection measures 
for various industries, transportation, agriculture, and so on). 
  Procedure for the development and implementation of federal 
directed environmental programs was established by Russian 
Federation Government Decree No. 638, issued on 27 August 1992. 
  The procedure for development of directed environmental 
programs includes the following stages: 
  -- compilation of a list of one-time programs to be 
implemented, that list to be based on a selective and 
coordinated list of regional issues that can be resolved on the 
basis of a program; decisionmaking to further develop those 
issues; 
  -- designation of a body to manage the directed program, a 
body that will be responsible for the creation and 
implementation of each specific program and the sources of 
development funding; 
  -- designation of a head of program development and 
co-executors (this should, as a rule, be done on a competitive 
basis); 
  -- approval of the technical objective of program 
development; 
  -- preparation of a draft program; 
  -- coordination of the program with affected organizations; 
  -- approval of the program. 
  One essential condition for effective program implementation 
is the creation of a clearly functioning organizational and 
economic mechanism for management of the environmental program 
which will be adequate to its goals and objectives and to the 
conditions of transition to market-based relations. 
  That mechanism must define: 
  -- the program's legal status; 
  -- the administrative body and administrative structure for 
program implementation; 
  -- methods of arranging physical and technical support 
(state 
orders, agreements, contracts, or leasing); 
  -- sources of and procedure for program measure funding; 
  -- procedure, methods, and schedules for monitoring of 
program implementation; 
  -- forms of economic and other incentives for program 
participants; 
  -- forms of economic and administrative liability on the 
part 
of program participants for failure to complete or for partial 
completion of program measures. 
  One specific feature of programs to reduce or prevent 
environmental pollution is that they set long-range limits on 
pollutant emissions and discharges and outline development 
scenarios that will ensure that the established limits are 
achieved. 
  The technical and economic justification for specific 
environmental protection measures should be provided during the 
process of preparing programs for the development of individual 
enterprises and industries, and programs for regional 
socioeconomic development, with consideration for actual 
financial balances. The degree of correlation between regional 
and industry programs and the environmental programs approved 
should be determined with the consent of environmental 
protection agencies or in the process of state environmental 
assessment, as provided for by legislation. 
  During implementation of this approach, consideration will 
be 
given to the environmental factor during development of all 
programs for the country's social and economic development. 
  Programmatic solutions to each priority issue, with 
consideration for their specific nature and scale, ambitious 
schedules for their resolution, and the need to focus resources 
in order to implement them, should make provision for economic 
support for implementation that will include designation of 
measures to be carried out using the federal, regional, and 
local budgets, as well as state nonbudgetary environmental funds 
at all levels. 
  Such measures include: 
  -- construction of interfarm land improvement systems, 
environmental protection facilities and hydraulic installations, 
land improvement, maintenance of land improvement systems in 
areas populated by small peoples and at labor-short farms in the 
non-Chernozem zone, Siberia, and the Far East; 
  -- research work of industry-wide significance; 
  -- efforts to radically improve lands in connection with 
increased soil fertility, including the study and preparation of 
planning and estimate documentation; 
  -- planning and survey work on the organization of land use; 
  -- forest protection and restoration measures; 
  -- hydrometeorological and environmental monitoring work; 
  -- topographical and geodesic work; 
  -- a program to ensure environmental safety; 
  -- state preserves; 
  -- construction of environmental protection facilities in 
preserves, as well as laboratories for the conducting of 
environmental monitoring; 
  -- construction of major interregional drinking water 
reservoirs, as well as other water management measures intended 
to improve the ecological condition of bodies of water.
