  [Text] Buenos Aires, 15 May (NA) -- The Argentine Coast 
Guard has reported that a Ukrainian factory ship was caught 
today fishing illegally in the exclusive economic zone, 198.6 
nautical miles off Buenos Aires Province. 
  The Coast Guard cutter Prefecto Fique intercepted the 
Ukrainian-flagged Koronometr at 0100 today with its nets 
deployed. The decision was made to board it. 
  The coast guard crew confirmed that the large factory ship, 
which has an overall length of 83 meters, was transporting 56.8 
tonnes of fish meal and 32.7 tonnes of processed squid which had 
been caught in Argentine territorial waters without 
authorization. 
  Confirming the infringement, the captain of the Ukrainian 
vessel was made to sail toward Mar del Plata port, where it will 
arrive tomorrow at 1000 local time to face charges of violation 
of domestic fishing laws. 
  These laws provide for the seizure of the illegal catch and 
the payment of a fine that can go as high as $1 million.
