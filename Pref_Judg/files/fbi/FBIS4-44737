  [Text] Fanuc Robotics Deutschland GmbH (Bernhaeuser Str. 
22, 73765 Neuhausen) wants to display a new series of six-axis 
heavy-duty robots at the Hannover Trade Fair. The S-42Oi robots 
have new controls integrated into the robot arm. The company 
claims this will save production space, which is needed for the 
usual control box, and will reduce wiring costs. The new robots 
are said to have better acceleration values and can reduce the 
cycle time by 20 percent. Moreover, further increase in 
availability is also achieved by reducing the number of parts, 
the company reports.
