  [Text] As reported by Vilyam Zadorskyy, head of chair of 
chemical and ecological technology at the Chemical and 
Technological University and president of the Dnieper Region 
Ecological Fund, Ukraine occupies a leading place in the world 
in the volume of accumulated waste. It annually processes about 
1.5 billion tonnes of natural resources, and two-thirds of them 
turn into solid waste. Altogether at least 15 billion tonnes of 
waste occupying a territory greater than 130,000 hectares have 
accumulated.
