  [Text] Brasilia, 18 Feb (EFE) -- The Brazilian Foreign 
Ministry has denied an alleged Venezuelan military foray inside 
Brazilian territory in the Amazon region. 
  Brazilian Foreign Ministry sources in Brasilia said the 
information regarding an incursion by Venezuelan National Guard 
troops to capture Brazilian "garimpeiros" (illegal miners) is 
"absurd." 
  The Brazilian Foreign Ministry has not been informed about 
the possible detention of "garimpeiros" by Venezuelan 
authorities, even though the possibility cannot be ruled out, 
the sources added. 
  Entrepreneur Jose Altino Machado, who owns machinery for the 
illegal mining of minerals in the Amazon region, said that last 
week the Venezuelan National Guard entered Brazilian territory 
to capture 32 "garimpeiros" and the "garimpeiros" were later 
taken to the Venezuelan city of Puerto Ayacucho. 
  In the past few years dozens of Brazilian "garimpeiros" have 
been arrested by the National Guard on charges of illegal mining 
of gold and other minerals in Venezuela. On some occasions 
authorities were able to confirm reports of Venezuelan forays 
inside Brazilian territory. 
  Brazil and Venezuela share a common border 2,000 km long 
that 
is sparsely controlled, has minimal communications, and few 
settlements. 
  According to officials sources, the problem of illegal 
mining, the protection of indigenous populations, and the Amazon 
region's development will be discussed during an official visit 
Brazilian President Itamar Franco will make to Venezuela between 
3 and 5 March. 
  Franco will travel to Venezuela at the invitation of 
Venezuelan President Rafael Caldera.
