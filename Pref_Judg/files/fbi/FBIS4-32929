  [Text] The whale sanctuary in the Antarctic has been 
approved. Most of the countries participating in the 46th annual 
meeting of the International Whaling Commission [IWC] said yes 
to the proposal to establish an area of protection against 
commercial whaling. Thirty countries participated in the final 
vote. Of these, 23 countries, including Mexico, were in favor. 
One country, Japan, voted against the proposal. There were six 
abstentions. Norway decided not to participate in the vote. 
  The sanctuary that was accepted corresponds to the proposal 
presented on Thursday morning by Mexico, France, and Chile and 
was supported by the rest of the nations. It will be located at 
latitude 40 degrees south, but the 200 nautical miles of Chile 
and Argentina will be respected.
