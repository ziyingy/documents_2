  [Text] Yesterday, State Councillor Chen Junsheng, head of 
the State Flood Control and Drought Relief Headquarters, led a 
central joint work team to go deep into Zhanjiang and Maoming, 
which have been severely hit by floods, in order to visit and 
express sympathy and solicitude to flood victims and to inspect 
the work of restoring production following the calamity. 
  Chen Junshen was satisfied with the work done by Zhanjiang 
and Maoming in dealing with the aftermath of the floods. He 
encouraged flood victims to take active measures to help 
themselves by engaging in production, and to reconstruct their 
homes. At the (Beiganzha) work site, located on the lower 
reaches of the Jiuzhou Jiang, Chen Junsheng spoke to 2,000 
people's militia men who were doing rush repairs of dykes. On 
behalf of the CPC Central Committee, the State Council, and the 
Central Military Commission, he expressed his deep sympathy and 
solicitude to the masses in the flooded areas. He also 
expressed his regards and thanks to officers and men of the 
People's Liberation Army, the officers and men of the People's 
Armed Police Force, public security officers and policemen, and 
cadres and masses who made important contributions to the 
present drive to fight floods and provide disaster relief. 
  In (Jingai) village of (Hetang) administrative area in 
(Hedi) 
town under Lianjiang city, Chen Junsheng and his party walked 
into the makeshift shack of a peasant named Zhang Xifang. Chen 
asked Zhang in detail about his daily life arrangements. When 
he learned that the houses of 32 out of the 38 households in the 
village had collapsed, Chen told Vice Governor Zhong Qixian, who 
was standing beside him: In the future, the government must 
strengthen the work of making plans and providing guidance to 
help peasants build their houses, and reduce the threat of 
calamities to them.
