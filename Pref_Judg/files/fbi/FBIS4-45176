  [Text] Santa Fe de Bogota, 26 May (EFE) -- Alleged drug 
trafficker Humberto Renteria of a northern Valle Department drug 
cartel today surrendered to justice in Cali. Renteria decided 
to surrender because he has "accounts pending" with justice 
officials and which link him to drug trafficking, according to 
sources at the Valle Regional Prosecutor's Office. 
  The repentant drug trafficker appeared before this office in 
the company of his lawyer. He is now waiting to be assigned to 
the prison where he will stay until his legal situation is 
defined. Renteria's action came several days after the 
suspension of the gradual surrenders of alleged members of drug 
trafficking gangs in Valle and Cali. 
  The top leaders of this country's drug trafficking gangs, 
brothers Gilberto and Miguel Rodriguez Orejuela, as well as 
others, announced some months ago their willingness to turn 
themselves in, but they have not done so even though their 
lawyers have contacted judicial authorities on several occasions. 
  Renteria and other drug traffickers who have surrendered 
have 
agreed to accept the government's surrender policy, which offers 
them legal advantages and sentence reductions.
