<F P=106> [Editorial: "ASEAN Must Not Water Down ILO Safeguards for </F>
Workers"] 
  [Text] As the International Labour Organization opened its 
81st annual conference in Geneva yesterday, ASEAN officials were 
preparing to table a resolution that would condemn Western 
attempts to link trade with labour standards. 
  The resolution will also call on the UN agency to review 
some 
of its labour standards which ASEAN delegates claim are not 
based on norms and values of developing countries. 
  But ASEAN's most urgent concern is to win an assurance from 
the ILO that it will strongly resist the introduction of new 
conditions binding social clauses and ILO labour standards with 
market accessibility. 
  The issue of workers' rights has become particularly 
sensitive for ASEAN countries, most of which are on a US 
watchlist for alleged labour violations. 
<H5>  `Social dumping' </H5>
  At March's final meeting of the General Agreement of Tariffs 
and Trade (GATT) in Marrakesh the issue almost scuttled the 
signing of the new World Trade Organization as developing 
nations fought off a US and French bid to include labour rights 
in the new global trade treaty. 
  The basis of the West's complaint is "social dumping" -- a 
belief that the lower wages paid to poorer people in developing 
countries means that firms are able to compete unfairly against 
employers in more advanced lands, who must provide more benefits 
for their workers. ASEAN leaders, whose countries have 
prospered as sources of cheap labour, claim this as a disguised 
form of protectionism. 
  ASEAN officials were correct to resist the insertion of 
social clauses in a world trade pact because they are protecting 
the right of their workers to sell their labour on the 
international market, much in the same way as the West seeks 
open markets in the East to sell its goods and services. 
  But what is alarming about the ASEAN push is that the 
regional bloc also seems intent on watering down international 
safeguards for the protection of workers' rights including 
unionization, safety requirements and basic wages. 
  Thailand, which has traditionally been more deferential in 
dealing with Western pressure over worker's rights than 
neighbours like Malaysia and Singapore, is becoming more and 
more vocal on the issue. 
  While it is encouraging to see Thailand become more 
assertive 
in the international arena it is unfortunate it has chosen an 
area where it has such a bleak record. After coming off a year 
in which it posted a record for the number industrial accidents 
including the world's worst ever factory fire, it would have 
been hoped Thailand would be more circumspect about lending its 
support to an attempt to lower safeguards for the rest of the 
world's workers. 
  Only last Tuesday, the ILO denounced forced child labour and 
prostitution in Thailand, and urged the government to take steps 
to end it. 
  The report, based on an ILO mission here last September, 
said 
children in Thailand continued to be forcibly recruited for work 
in factories, sweatshops or brothels in Bangkok and in the 
provinces, adding: "...illegal shops exist by the thousands". 
  "The situation is often linked to forced or false 
recruitment, deception and trafficking," it said. "Children are 
exploited because they are young and helpless, they are deprived 
of the right to lead a normal childhood, deprived of education, 
deprived of a future." 
  The same day as the report came out, police raided a 
Thonburi 
sweat shop where 30 girls, some of whom had been there four 
years, were being forced to work 16 hours a day without pay. On 
being freed, the girls told tales of being beaten regularly and 
fed rotten food. 
<H5>  Venal and brutal employers </H5>
  Clearly there is much that needs to be done to curb the 
excesses of venal and brutal Thai employers. 
  Last week, the United Nations singled out Thailand, along 
with a dozen other countries, for the tremendous development it 
had achieved over the last three decades. Much of that success 
has been due to the fact that Thai workers were willing to toil 
harder and longer for less pay and in worse conditions than 
their counterparts in other part of the world. Thai employers 
have grown rich beyond all expectations and the lives of workers 
have also improved but there is still much more than can be done 
before Thailand can be proud of its labour record. 
  The government is right to take action to protect the Thai 
economy from dubiously-intentioned foreign efforts to constrain 
it. But it should not use this position as a pretext to deny 
Thai workers the rewards and conditions they have labored hard 
to earn or to weaken the little protection ILO standards offer 
the rest of the world's workers.
