  [Text] Two Israeli workers were stabbed a short while ago 
in Kibbutz Nahal 'Oz by one or several terrorists who 
infiltrated into the kibbutz. Our correspondent Nisim Qeynan 
reports that one of the terrorist attacked the two workers with 
a knife in a trailer on the outskirts of the kibbutz. Another 
worker in an adjacent trailer heard their cries for help, pulled 
out his gun, and captured one terrorist. IDF [Israel Defense 
Forces] and Border Police forces are searching the area in an 
attempt to locate a second terrorist. 
  One of the men was seriously wounded and taken to the Soroka 
Medical Center. He is currently being operated on. The second 
man sustained light to moderate injuries.
