<H5>  Foreword </H5>
  In advanced industrial countries the production of knowledge 
and the turning of this knowledge into innovative products and 
manufacturing processes are decisive for growth and prosperity 
and determine the importance of countries in international 
politics. Japan has proven to what extent this is possible. 
Bavarian industry too has been able in recent decades to 
strengthen its position in the international innovation 
competition. But, considering the dramatic shifts of emphasis in 
world markets because of Japan and the emergent industrial 
nations in East Asia, one asks the question what is to be done 
to maintain Bavarian industry's position and to strengthen it 
further in the coming decades. 
  Against this backdrop the Bavarian state government's 
scientific and technical advisory board commissioned IFO to 
analyze Bavarian industry's strengths and weaknesses in 
individual fields of technology, to reveal growth opportunities 
for Bavarian industry with alternative scenarios for the future, 
and to work out points of departure for Bavarian research and 
technology policy for ensuring and strengthening Bavarian 
industry's innovation might. 
  The study was made in 1991 by the industry and structure 
department (then headed by W. Gerstenberger). The analysis is 
based for one thing on making use of the data on world R&amp;D 
output prepared by IFO's patent statistics department, and on 
another on interviews of high-tech companies as well as of 
scientists and engineers at universities and government research 
institutes. The people in charge of the research project were 
aided by Eberhard Buckel, who performed the extensive 
computations for the analysis of international patent 
statistics, which are documented in detail in a table appendix. 
The interviewees' willingness to be interviewed at length was a 
prerequisite for the study's being done. The people in charge of 
the project would like to express their heartfelt gratitude to 
the participants for this. 
  The study could not be published till now, after the 
scientific and technical advisory board developed 
recommendations for further action based on the study and 
presented them to the public at the end of 1992.

<H5>  The Most Important Results in Brief </H5>
  Bavarian industry has strengthened its position in the 
Federal Republic of Germany in recent decades and in so doing 
has concentrated on aerospace, motor vehicle manufacturing, the 
electrotechnical and electronics industry and machine 
manufacturing as emphases. 
  German inventors are generally doing well with third place 
in 
the international innovation competition. Strengths 
(environmental engineering, transportation engineering, chemical 
engineering) and weaknesses (electronics, data systems and 
communication technology, biotechnology and genetic engineering) 
show here. Bavarian research holds an above-average position 
within Germany in almost every field studied. This is especially 
pronounced in laser and superconductor technology and power 
engineering, but also in electronics and data systems and 
communication technology. Diverse non-industrial research 
activities pepper the research fields forming the basis of this 
study. 
  The picture of future research requirements is based on 
three 
scenarios (the affluent information society; environmental 
problems; East-West and North-South tensions) and their effects 
on specific fields of application of technology and on spheres 
of life. These seven fields are data systems and communications, 
the environment, energy, transportation, agricultural 
production, medicine/health, and security and defense. 
  Metrology and control engineering will gain in importance 
from various viewpoints in the future, resulting in 
corresponding research requirements in the fields of 
electronics, optronics, sensor technology, micromechanics and 
microsystem engineering. The field of data systems and 
communications likewise requires research in electronics, 
optronics and photonics--specifically: new compound 
semiconductors, three-dimensional components, optical 
waveguides, systems for optronic or photonic data processing, 
microsensor technology, and microsystem engineering. 
  There is a great demand for research in laser technology and 
superconductor technology, for which tremendous application 
potential is in store if high-temperature superconductors can be 
used in practice. 
  The field of materials, including surface and thin-film 
technology, is likewise a research field of a crucial nature. 
Materials for electronics, engineering ceramics, lightweight 
construction materials, high-temperature materials, functional 
polymers, composite materials and biological polymers are 
important research directions with a great demand. 
  Public health, agriculture and ecology need research results 
from biotechnology and genetic engineering. Protein, peptide and 
enzyme research, microorganisms and genome decoding are the 
keywords for research directions. 
  A research policy priority for the field of data systems and 
communications is to be inferred from the scenario-influenced 
trend in various fields of application of technology. The 
structure of Bavarian industry provides a good basis for this. 
This prioritizing includes microelectronics, optronics, sensor 
technology, micromechanics and microsystem engineering as well 
as the materials possible in each case. It also includes the 
development of more powerful computers and corresponding 
software. 
  In addition, research emphasis should be placed on the 
fields 
of photovoltaics, hydrogen technology and recycling--especially 
of electronic equipment--and on certain research fields in 
biotechnology and genetic engineering.
