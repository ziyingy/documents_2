  [Text] Quito, 24 Jan (EFE) -- Representatives of Ecuador's 
indigenous people today threatened to seize oil wells in the 
nation's Amazon region if the government proceeds with the 
seventh round of bids -- a bidding process for which the 
indigenous people have requested a 15-year moratorium. 
  Luis Macas, president of the Confederation of Indigenous 
Nationalities of Ecuador (Conaie), said the indigenous people 
are willing to take up the last resort, adding that the 
indigenous people and others residing in the Amazon region could 
even seize the wells ``to prevent additional ecological 
disaster.'' 
  The Ecuadoran Government today opened the seventh round of 
petroleum bids for the exploration and exploitation of 3.2 
million hectares in the Ecuadoran Amazon region and offshore 
areas. The indigenous people's representative said the 
petroleum companies have caused irreparable damage to the 
environment and to the life of the inhabitants of the Ecuadoran 
Amazon region. 
  Macas said, ``The Ecuadoran Government is putting the only 
green area left in the Amazon region up for bid, and this is the 
reason why we have requested a 15-year moratorium on the 
bidding.'' 
  The indigenous leader added that the exploitation of 
petroleum has been carried out in an irrational manner and 
without consulting the people who are most affected -- namely, 
the indigenous people and residents of the Ecuadoran Amazon 
region. The Conaie president noted that the indigenous people 
have filed a suit with the Human Rights Commission of the OAS, 
and he added that the international organization is waiting for 
the government to send the commission an invitation to inspect 
the oil drilling areas. 
  Ecuador's environmental and indigenous people's 
organizations 
this morning took over the Energy and Mines Ministry to pressure 
the government not to carry out the bidding. They also 
requested a meeting with President Sixto Duran-Ballen.
