  [Text] Tokyo, May 10 KYODO -- Three Chinese suspected of 
helping immigrants enter Japan illegally have been put on the 
wanted list, the metropolitan police department said Tuesday [10 
May]. The three are believed to be members of a detained 
Chinese group that allegedly brokered the illegal immigration of 
71 Chinese in Wakayama Prefecture in February. 
  The two men and one woman, whose whereabouts are unknown, 
are 
suspected of helping to hide and guard the immigrants after 
their arrival. 
  New evidence indicates the group was also behind the illegal 
immigration of another 28 Chinese last November, investigators 
at the department's public security division said. At an 
apartment in Tokyo's Toshima Ward, which presumably served as 
the group's hideout, investigators found notes mentioning 
"travel expenses for 28" or "prepare bread for 28 guests." 
  The findings indicate the group provided the immigrants with 
train tickets and provisions, investigators said. 
  Preliminary investigations found the leader of a Hong Kong 
smuggling ring paid 1.5 million yen to the group to bring the 
immigrants to Japan. The ring had developed a sophisticated 
network with separate groups supervising different legs of the 
journey. 
  One group organized the trip from local areas in China to 
the 
port of embarkation and another was responsible for the crossing 
to Japan. A third batch accompanied the newly arrived to Nagoya 
Station, where they were taken over [by] a fourth group that 
guided them to Tokyo Station, the final destination. 
  The arrested group dealt with the Nagoya-Tokyo transaction, 
according to police.
