  [Text] Beijing, March 17 (XINHUA) -- The first securities 
and futures exhibition in China will be held here in late April. 
  As part of China's economic reform, securities and futures 
markets came into being just a few years ago and are still at a 
fledgling stage. 
  The event is aimed to popularize knowledge about securities 
and futures, promote the issuing of state bonds and vitalize the 
securities and futures markets, which have been running 
sluggishly of late. 
  The exhibition will be sponsored by the Ministry of Finance, 
China Securities News, Beijing Commodities Exchange, China 
International Futures Broker Company, Beijing Institute for 
Research of Modern Economy, Beijing Securities Company and 
Beijing Siyuan Consultative Agency on Mergers and Bankruptcies.
