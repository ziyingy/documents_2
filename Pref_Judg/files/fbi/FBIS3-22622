  [Text] Kikinda -- After having diagnosed rabies in 
several wild and domestic animals, the Ministries for 
Agriculture, Forestry, and Water Resources of the republic of 
Serbia have issued a statement pronouncing the town of Kikinda 
and the surrounding region contaminated by rabies. 
  In order to fight and root out the disease, the authorities 
intend to carry out the listing, vaccination, and marking of all 
unvaccinated dogs and cats older than four months. All citizens 
of Kikinda who are owners of unvaccinated animals, have to bring 
in their pets to the yard of the veterinary station next week 
for vaccination, that is from 23 February until 25 February. 
  The ministry has also issued a decree that, in order to 
successfully fight rabies, dogs and cats must be held locked in 
houses. In addition, trading in such animals, as well as 
exhibitions and fairs, is forbidden, which also applies to wild 
animals.
