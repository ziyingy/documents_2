  [Text] Tokyo, Jan 6 KYODO -- Japan will dispatch a 
research ship to the North Pacific on a one-month mission to 
investigate the cause of the global warming phenomenon, the 
Fishery Agency said Thursday [6 January]. 
  The 2,000-ton Kaiyo Maru will set out Friday on the mission 
that is part of a 42-nation, 10-year project, known as the World 
Ocean Circulation Experiment (WOCE), the agency said. 
  The WOCE was launched in 1990 as a multilateral project to 
counteract the threat from global warming, which some scientists 
warn could make the earth uninhabitable for living creatures in 
the long run. 
  The scientists warn the burning of oil and other fossil 
fuels 
would boost the average temperature of the atmosphere by 
trapping heat from the earth's surface with an increasing 
density of carbon dioxide that prevents the dissipation of heat 
into space. 
  Under the WOCE, Japan is entrusted with investigating global 
warming in five broad areas. 
  This year, Japan will probe the phenomenon at 70 locations 
along the line of 30 degree latitude in a broad area of the 
North Pacific between the Japanese archipelago and the west 
coast of the United States. 
  The ship will measure the density of carbon dioxide and 
salinity and the temperatures of seawater at these 70 sites at 
intervals of 50 to 70 kilometers, the agency said. 
  On top of the research related to the global warming, the 
ship will investigate the living environment of tuna and other 
migratory fish at 90 locations to help assess the future 
conditions of fishery resources, it added.
