Kiev on 25 Apr] 
  [Text] In order to attract foreign investments for the 
development of Ukraine's merchant fleet and in conformity with 
item 7-4 of Article 114-5 of Ukraine's Constitution, I resolve 
as follows: 
  1. To allow parallel state registration in Ukraine of 
foreign vessels used on the terms of bearboat [berbout] charter 
accord by entrepreneurs other than those representing 
enterprises with foreign investments. 
  2. To allow such vessels to sail under Ukraine's state flag 
after they are entered into Ukraine's State Registry of Shipping. 
  3. Ukraine's Cabinet of Ministers must adopt, within one 
month, Regulations on the Procedure for State Registration of 
Those Foreign Vessels that are used by entrepreneurs on the 
terms of bearboat-charter accord and to determine the size of 
tax to be levied on the charterer for the parallel state 
registration.
