  [Text] The Russian Defense Ministry has just received an 
ITAR-TASS report that allegedly a program for military 
cooperation between NATO and the Russian military department was 
signed on 28 January. However, the Russian Defense Ministry 
knows nothing about this. One thing is known for sure, a group 
of NATO representatives really did work in Moscow for two days 
and discussed cooperation prospects with the Russian military. 
Mutual understanding was reached on many problems. But no 
official documents were signed.
