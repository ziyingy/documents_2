  [Text] Kiev, 9 April (AFP) -- Russian sailors arrested the 
Ukrainian Navy's number two after his coastguards were prevented 
from boarding a survey vessel of the disputed Black Sea Fleet, a 
Ukrainian Navy spokesman said Saturday. 
  The Navy's Deputy Commander in Chief, Nikolay Zhibarev, was 
held overnight Friday [8 April] when he boarded the ship as it 
left the Ukrainian port of Odessa for Sevastopol, the Fleet's 
base in Crimea, with a Russian Navy crew at the helm, the 
spokesman said. 
  The vessel was fitted with ocean survey and radio-navigation 
equipment valued at 10 million dollars, the spokesman said. 
  Ukrainian coastguards tried to board the vessel because it 
had been "illegally" moved from its berth, but Zhibarev was 
arrested by Russian sailors called as reinforcements from 
Odessa, the spokesman added. 
  The same source added that the Russian sailors had been 
ordered to shoot if necessary to retain control of the ship. 
  At Sevastopol, top officials of the Fleet, which is based in 
the autonomous Ukrainian republic of Crimea but under the de 
facto control of the Russian Navy, said they had no information 
on the arrest of Zhibarev. 
  Fleet spokesman Andrey Grachev added that the ship "was not 
examined by the coastguards because it was operating within a 
Fleet deployment zone and was travelling from one Ukrainian port 
to another." 
  Grachev said Ukraine had not paid for the survey equipment, 
which had therefore needed to be returned to Sevastopol.
