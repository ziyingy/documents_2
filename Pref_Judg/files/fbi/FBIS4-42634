  [Text] Bonn [no date as received] (DDP/ADN) -- Finance 
Minister Theo Waigel welcomes the rescheduling of Russia's debts 
as agreed by the Paris Club creditor countries this past 
weekend. Waigel said in Bonn on Monday [6 June] that the 
rescheduling had gained Russia "more breathing space" for its 
debts of more than $7 billion, which would otherwise have had to 
be paid this year. The extension of the deadline on payment on 
the debt would above all relieve the Russian state budget. Its 
stabilization was the main component of the reform program. 
  Waigel also stressed that, as the biggest creditor with $2.7 
million or 4.5 billion marks, Germany was once again making the 
greatest contribution. Relevant provisions have been made in 
the 1994 German federal budget and in the draft budget for 1995. 
Waigel now called upon Russia to conclude the planned 
rescheduling with the commercial banks. A satisfactory solution 
also had to be found soon for debts owed to German exporters 
without federal guarantees.
