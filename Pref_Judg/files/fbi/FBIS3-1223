  [Text] The Lebowa government has appealed to the TEC 
[Transitional Executive Council] to take over financial control 
of the homeland. Chief Minister Nelson Ramodike said, in a 
statement this afternoon, that the tension between his 
government and the Department of Regional and Land Affairs, 
which controls the finances of the region, was the cause of the 
collapse of services. Thirty-thousand striking civil servants 
have virtually crippled the Lebowa government. The situation 
came to a head today when members of the police force began a 
sit-in. They said they had been promised salary increases which 
never materialized. Isolated incidents of violence have also 
been reported, and at least three government vehicles were set 
alight in Seshego.
