  [Text] Beijing, 8 Feb (XINHUA) -- China successfully 
launched a space survey satellite, the "Practice IV," and a 
simulated satellite with a "Long March IIIA" carrier rocket from 
the Xichang Satellite Launching Center at 1634 [0834 GMT] today. 
According to reports from the Xian Satellite Monitoring and 
Control Center and the "Yuan Wang," a ship engaged in 
astronautics surveying on the Pacific Ocean, the two satellites 
have reached their synchronous orbits and the launch was a 
success. 
  The carrier rocket, "Long March IIIA," is a new type which 
the National Astronautics Industrial Company developed and built 
for launching China's new satellites for telecommunications and 
broadcasting services. The rocket, which is based on the "Long 
March III," has incorporated many advanced technologies and its 
carrying capacity has increased from its previous 1.4 tonnes to 
the present 2.5 tonnes. This was the first time the new rocket 
was used. Experts say that the "Long March IIIA's" successful 
launch shows that the family of Chinese carrier rockets now has 
a new member, and that China's capacity for astronautical 
launching has reached a new level. 
  The Chinese Academy of Sciences Space Center uses the 
"Practice IV" satellite to survey space. The satellite's six 
probes are primarily used to survey the space environment and 
test environmental effects.
