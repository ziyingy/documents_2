  [Excerpts] The Musaga Estate was the site yesterday of 
certain incidents that increased tension in the area, after an 
Otracom [Office of Transport and Communication] bus was attacked 
with a grenade. We managed to telephone the head of the Musaga 
zone, who first of all briefed us on the security situation in 
the zone in an interview with our colleague, Antoine Kaburahe. 
[passage omitted] 
  We have not managed to link up with the head of the 
Nyakabiga 
zone, but there is trouble there, as well, which reportedly has 
caused between 20 and 40 deaths since yesterday afternoon. The 
killings are still going on up to this moment, despite the 
presence of security forces on the spot.
