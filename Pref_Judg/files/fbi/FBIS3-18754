  [Excerpts] "Our national independence is not threatened by 
any propaganda, even though it may falsify history, as much as 
it is threatened by NATO's presence and actions in the Balkans." 
This was stressed yesterday by KKE [Greek Communist Party] 
General Secretary Aleka Papariga following her meeting with 
Prime Minister Andreas Papandreou. 
  During the meeting with the prime minister, Papariga 
outlined 
the KKE views on the Balkan crisis, of which Greece has become a 
part due to its dispute with FYROM [The Former Yugoslav Republic 
of Macedonia]. She also expressed the party's opposition to the 
nationalist rallies, which "introduce the poison of nationalism 
and chauvinism to the Greek people," especially to the younger 
generation that is urged to participate. 
  Finally, the KKE general secretary stressed the need for the 
formation of a front of various peoples against the so-called 
foreign protectors to defend against their intervention and deal 
with any differences among these peoples. 
  Following her meeting with the prime minister, Papariga 
said: 
"As you know, the meeting took place following our own 
initiative to be briefed on developments in the Balkans and to 
officially express our views. 
  ``I want to stress the issues I raised with the prime 
minister on behalf of the KKE. 
  ``We consider that our country and our national independence 
is not threatened by any propaganda, even though it may falsify 
history, as much as it is threatened by NATO's presence and 
actions in the Balkans. 
  ``The new element that concerns us is the downing of the 
planes. NATO is now carrying out relatively autonomous 
actions.'' [passage omitted] 
  "Therefore, we are concerned about NATO and the situation in 
the area and believe that it is a danger and a continuous threat 
to Greece. Greece is already part of the crisis in the Balkans, 
and the government's countermeasures have further involved our 
country." [passage omitted]
