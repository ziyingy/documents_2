  [Text] Law and Order Minister Hernus Kriel has confirmed 
that a large number of official documents were destroyed as he 
prepared to leave office. Mr. Kriel insisted, however, that the 
documents were not secret, but were party political papers and 
personal documents. But a source close to the department claimed 
that officials shredded documents which showed that the SAP 
[South African Police] favoured the NP [National Party] over the 
ANC. The source said so much paper had to be destroyed ahead of 
elections that the ministry's own paper shedders could not cope.
