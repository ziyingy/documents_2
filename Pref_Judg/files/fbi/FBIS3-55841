  [Text] Moscow, January 11 (TASS) -- A long-term credit of 
10 billion rubles (about 8 million U.S. dollars) has been 
allocated by Russia to Georgia for 1994 to help survive its 
depressed economy, an official from the Georgian Embassy in 
Moscow told ITAR-TASS on Tuesday [11 January]. 
  Moreover, as the republic has joined the Commonwealth of 
Independent States, additional technical credits for keeping 
functioning the Georgian metallurgic and mining industries are 
being considered, he said. 
  The same source reported that an agreement has been reached 
to plug in the Georgian power network to the united energy 
system of the southern Russia.
