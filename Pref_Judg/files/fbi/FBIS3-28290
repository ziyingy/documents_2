  [Text] A senior official of the Bank of Japan, in 
connection with U.S. decision on 4 February to implement a 
tighter monetary policy, believes that "it is a precautionary 
measure against inflation and will have little impact on 
Japanese economy, since chances are slim that long- and 
short-term interest rates in the United States will rise 
rapidly." He, therefore, maintains that "Japanese monetary 
policies will not be affected."
