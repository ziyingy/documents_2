  [Text] Seoul, March 12 (YONHAP) -- South Korea, Japan and 
Russia start month-long joint testing of the East Sea from March 
18 to look for signs of contamination from radioactive waste 
dumped by Moscow, Foreign Ministry officials said Saturday. 
  The 4,000-ton Okean, a Russian survey vessel, will cover 
seven test points in the area, which lies between Korea and 
Japan, during the one-month period, officials said. 
  A total of 32 surveyers -- seven from South Korea, nine from 
Japan, 15 from Russia and one from the International Atomic 
Energy Agency (IAEA) -- will participate in taking samples of 
the water, seabed and plankton. 
  The three countries agreed to bear the cost equally. 
  On-the-spot test results will be out within one month after 
the Okean completes its route, but the final analysis will not 
come out until approximately a year later. 
  A second set of surveys is planned sometime in the middle of 
the year, officials said.
