  [Text] It is impossible for Thailand and other foreign 
governments to respond to a call by opium warlord Khun Sa to 
extend aid and help develop Shan state. 
  This is the response of the secretary general of the 
Narcotics Control Board, Gen Chawalit Yotmani, to Khun Sa's 
promise to stop growing poppies and operating heroin refineries. 
  Khun Sa's self-proclaimed "Independent Shan State" in Burma 
is considered illegal, and Thailand cannot cooperate with him, 
Gen Chawalit said. 
  Khun Sa still produces heroin and is the key man behind the 
narcotics trade, and Thailand will continue its suppression 
policy against the drug, he said. 
  He dismissed Khun Sa's claim that heroin is refined in the 
Golden Triangle but not in areas under his control. There are 
15-25 heroin refineries in Burma, Gen Chawalit said.
