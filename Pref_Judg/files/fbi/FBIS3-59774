  [Text] The Exposed Facility Flyer Unit (EFFU) is an orbital 
experimental facility to be mounted on the free flyer Space 
Flyer Unit (SFU). The SFU is scheduled to be launched by an H-II 
launch vehicle in early 1995. After several months in orbit, the 
SFU will be retrieved by the Space Shuttle. The EFFU will 
provide experience in developing the key technology of the 
Exposed Facility of Japanese Experiment Module (JEM), which will 
be attached to the Space Station Freedom in the late 1990s. The 
EFFU proto-flight model test was concluded. This paper describes 
the development of the EFFU. 
<H5>  1. Introduction </H5>
  An international consortium of countries and organizations 
including the United States, Canada, Japan, and the ESA 
(European Space Association) have been working jointly to 
develop an international space station which they hope to 
complete by the end of the century. Japan is in charge of 
developing and operating the JEM (Japanese Experiment Model). 
Figure 1 is a schematic drawing of the JEM. The JEM Exposed 
Facility, which Ishikawajima-Harima Heavy Industries (IHI) is in 
charge of developing, is a system which offers an exposed 
testing environment in space. The Exposed Facility Flyer Unit 
(EFFU) is a part of the JEM Exposed Facility and was built with 
the aim of improving reliability in the key technologies used in 
the JEM and mastering common experimental technologies. The EFFU 
will be carried aboard the Space Flyer Unit (SFU), which is the 
first recoverable and reusable experimental satellite developed 
by Japan, and will be used to perform orbital experiments. 



  IHI has been working on the EFFU since 1987 after being 
awarded a contract by the National Space Development Agency 
(NASDA). The fabrication of the EFFU proto-flight model is now 
complete, and it is undergoing SFU system tests as part of the 
SFU. This paper outlines the development of the EFFU. 
<H5>  2. EFFU </H5>
  2.1 Overview of SFU 
  As we can see in Figure 2, the EFFU is mounted on the SFU. 
The SFU is being jointly developed by three government agencies, 
namely, NASDA, which is part of the Science and Technology 
Agency, the ISAS (Institute of Space and Astronautical Science), 
which is part of the Ministry of Education, and MITI (Ministry 
of International Trade and Industry). The SFU will be launched 
in February 1995 aboard an H-II rocket and be put into orbit at 
an altitude of about 500 km. It will be used to conduct various 
material and biological experiments and make astronomical 
observations for approximately 4.5 months, and then be recovered 
and returned to earth by the Space Shuttle (U.S.). During that 
time, the EFFU will conduct orbital experiments that will take 
up a total of about 1.5 months. 



  2.2 Overview of EFFU 
  2.2.1 Main Specifications of EFFU 
  Figure 3 is an external view of the EFFU. The main frame of 
the EFFU, which is a truss structure, is covered on the outside 
by a multi-layer insulator. The EFFU weighs 282 kg. Its external 
dimensions are approximately 1.5 m x 1.5 m x 1.05 m. Below, we 
list the main specifications of the EFFU.

    2.2.2 Mission of EFFU&lt;sup&gt; (1)&lt;/sup&gt; 
  The purpose of the EFFU is to perform the orbital 
experiments 
listed below and evaluate the results obtained therein. 
  (1) Element Technologies in Fluid Loop Heat Control 
  The principle heat control method used in the JEM Exposed 
Facility is based on fluid loops. The technical data obtained 
from the fluid loop of the EFFU will be used to ascertain the 
behavior characteristics of fluids in an orbital environment and 
verify the validity of the thermal analysis methods. For that 
reason, the fluid loops will be operated for extended periods of 
time while in orbit so that we can obtain fluid loop data such 
as fluid temperature and pressure, as well as temperature data 
on the EFFU equipment and frame. 
  (2) Element Technologies in Equipment Exchange Unit 
  The equipment exchange unit (EEU) of the JEM is a mechanism 
which has a mechanical disconnect function for disconnecting the 
experimental payload from the JEM exposed facility, and also an 
interface function for supplying power, communication, and 
fluids. The EFFU x EEU uses the same transfer load mechanism, 
coupling retention force, and solid lubrication method for 
moving parts that the JEM x EEU uses. While in orbit, the EEU 
will conduct repeated disconnects so that we can evaluate the 
soundness of the interfaces such as the electrical connectors 
and fluid couplers, and evaluate the durability of the solid 
lubricants. 
  (3) Acquiring Microgravity Characteristic Data 
  We installed micro-acceleration sensors near the excitation 
sources in the EFFU and the gas dynamics experiment facility 
(GDEF) to verify that the GDEF is operating in a microgravity 
environment. In addition, we want to compare and verify the 
results of ground tests and analysis against the orbital 
microgravity data, and evaluate the vibration transmission 
characteristic and response characteristic, and then use this 
information in analyzing the microgravity environment of the JEM. 
  (4) Exposure Experiment on Elements and Materials 
  The SFU will be put into an orbit that is almost stationary 
to that of the sun. We will attach material samples necessary in 
the development of the JEM on both the sunlit and shady sides of 
the external surface of the EFFU to evaluate the properties of 
those materials while in space. 
  (5) Gas Dynamics Experiment&lt;sup&gt; (6)&lt;/sup&gt; 
  In the gas dynamics experiment, we will verify the growth of 
diamond crystal by the chemical vapor deposition method in an 
orbital microgravity environment. 
  2.2.3 EFFU Configuration 
  In Figure 4, we show the configuration of the EFFU, and in 
Figure 5, show a functional block diagram of the same. 







    (1) Infrastructure&lt;sup&gt; (3),(4)&lt;/sup&gt; 
  The main frame within the structural system is a truss-type 
structure made up of titanium and CFRP members. The equipment is 
mounted to panels that are supported by the main frame. Figure 4 
is a schematic drawing of the EFFU infrastructure. 
  (2) Heat Control System 
  Heat control is maintained by a fluid loop, which acts as 
the 
cooling medium, a heater, and a multi-layer insulator. The fluid 
loop consists of a pump-inverter, hot plate, cold plate, and 
radiator. The heat generated by the equipment is absorbed by the 
cold plate, transported to the radiator by the fluid loop, and 
vented into space. The heater is also activated as needed by a 
thermostat. 
  Figure 6 is a block diagram of the fluid loop in the heat 
control system. 



  (3) Communication Control System 
  The communication control system is made up of an EFFU 
control unit. The ECU monitors and controls the equipment within 
the EFFU, and communicates with the SFU. 
  (4) Electrical Power System 
  The electrical power system consists of an electrical power 
distribution unit (EPDU) that receives electrical power from the 
SFU and distributes that to the equipment within the EFFU. The 
EDPU is equipped with fuses corresponding to the equipment being 
supplied power. 
  (5) Experiment Support System 
  The experiment support system consists of an EEU, a 
microgravity measuring unit, and an exposed test unit for 
elements and materials. 
  The EEU is made up of an equipment exchange unit for the 
exposed facility, an equipment exchange unit for the payload, 
and a motor drive unit (MDU) that runs and controls the 
equipment exchange unit motor. Figure 7 is a functional block 
diagram of the EFFU x EEU. 



  (6) Gas Dynamics Experiment Facility&lt;sup&gt; (6)&lt;/sup&gt; 
  The gas dynamics experiment facility aboard the EFFU 
consists 
of a plasma reaction vessel, a reaction gas cylinder, a 
spectroscope, a camera, and control unit. 
  2.3 NASA Safety Requirements 
  The SFU will be retrieved by the NASA (U.S. National 
Aeronautics and Space Administration) Space Shuttle. For that 
reason, the EFFU mounted aboard the SFU must meet NASA 
requirements regarding safety. A NASA safety review board is in 
the process of determining if those safety standards have been 
met. The safety review has completed its second phase (a review 
of hazard potentials and follow-up control plans). The third 
phase of the safety review is coming next in which a report will 
be issued detailing the results of implementing the control 
plans indicated in the prior phase based on tests and 
verification data. 
<H5>  3. Development Outlined </H5>
  The development of the EFFU, as can be seen in Figure 8, was 
based on the EM/PFM (engineering model/proto-flight model) 
system. This system integrates the PM (protomodel) with the FM 
(flight model) to form the PFM. 



  In the detailed engineering phase, we built and tested a 
prototype of the engineering model, which is the development 
model, while in the maintenance design phase, we built and 
tested the PFM. After the SFU system tests are complete, 
adjustments will be made to a final flight component during the 
pre-launch modification period, and built into the SFU for 
launch. 
<H5>  4. Development of Engineering Models </H5>
  As for engineering models, we built and tested prototypes of 
a structural development model, a thermal development model, a 
system engineering model, and an SFU interface engineering 
model. Figure 9 is a flow diagram showing the engineering models. 



  4.1 Structure Development Model Testing&lt;sup&gt; (3,4)&lt;/sup&gt; 
  A structural model of the CFRP members and components that 
make up the infrastructure was fabricated ahead of the 
engineering model by element prototyping and testing and 
subjected to the following two tests. 
  (1) A materials test to gather data on CFRP parts for the 
NASA safety review, included in which is a tensile strength and 
heat cycle degradation test on CFRP parts. 
  (2) A structural model fabrication test on parts to perfect 
the key technologies used for the truss-type frame. 
  The SDM is a model in which a mass dummy is attached to the 
frame of the engineering model. With the SDM, an assortment of 
tests including static load tests, vibration tests, and mass 
characteristics tests were given to verify the soundness of the 
structural design and the validity of the numerical model used 
for the structure, to also verify the environmental conditions 
of the on-board equipment, and to perfect the fabrication and 
testing methods. Further tests were done on EFFU coupling with 
the SFU. 
  Also, to satisfy the fail-safe requirements demanded by 
NASA, 
various tests including static load and vibration tests were 
given to verify structural strength. In addition, there was also 
a fluorescent penetration test on metal parts, and an ultrasonic 
penetrant examination for composite parts and bonded parts, but 
nothing abnormal was reported. 
  4.2 Thermal Development Model Tests 
  The thermal development model is a model in which a mass 
dummy is removed from the structure development model, and is 
replaced by heat control equipment and a heat dummy. With the 
thermal development model, a thermal equilibrium test and heat 
vacuum preliminary test were administered. A post-test analysis 
and evaluation verified the fact that the fluid loop performed 
as designed, and that the thermal numerical model was in fact 
sound. 
  4.3 System Engineering Model Tests 
  The system engineering model is identical to the 
proto-flight 
model with the exceptions being that the EEU is a dummy, and 
there are no microgravity sensors. As far as system engineering 
model tests, we performed an electrical performance test for the 
entire EFFU, and an electromagnetic compatibility test, but no 
abnormalities were reported. 
  4.4 SFU Interface Tests 
  In conducting a verification test on the electrical 
interface, which is implemented by direct connection with the 
SFU, the engineering model designed for the SFU interface test 
was loaded aboard the SFU system prior to the SEM and the 
electrical interfaces with the SFU were verified. 
  4.5 Microgravity Ground Tests 
  Using a model in which the heater function was removed from 
the thermal development model, we conducted a microgravity 
ground test and obtained microgravity characteristic data for 
ground operation of the fluid loop, and analysis data on the 
vibration mode of the EFFU. The data obtained was used to 
determine the gain in microgravity sensors, the locations where 
microgravity sensors should be installed, and the direction of 
measurement. 
<H5>  5. PFM System Development </H5>
  As for the proto-flight model, we implemented and 
successfully completed the following tests after the 
post-assembly inspection. 
  (1) Initial electrical performance test 
  (2) Vibration test 
  (3) Thermal equilibrium test and heat vacuum test 
  (4) Final electrical performance test 
  5.1 Electrical Performance Test 
  In the electrical performance test, we verified that the 
electrical functions and characteristics in the EFFU met the 
necessary requirements. Based on the test results from the 
function test and final electrical performance test that were 
given before and after the vibration test, and during and after 
the heat vacuum test, we confirmed that there was not any 
degradation from the environmental test. 
  5.2 Vibration Test 
  Figure 10 is a photograph showing the setup for the 
vibration 
test. We applied a sine-wave vibration load, which is about the 
same given in an acceptance test, directly to the three axes of 
the EFFU, but found nothing abnormal in the EFFU. Tests also 
confirmed that the EFFU met the necessary requirements with 
regard to rigidity, and that both the vibration mode and the 
primary inherent vibration frequency agreed with analysis. 



  5.3 Thermal Equilibrium Test and Heat Vacuum Test 
  Figure 11 is a photograph showing the setup of the heat 
vacuum test. Tests confirmed the properties of the heat control 
system, and also confirmed that the EFFU can operate normally in 
high-temperature and low-temperature thermal vacuum 
environments. The test results from the heat equilibrium test 
confirmed the validity of the analytic model used for the 
proto-flight model. 



<H5>  6. Conclusion </H5>
  The manufacture of the EFFU-PFM is complete. After the SFU 
system tests are done, we will make improvements to perfect the 
flight components, and then schedule delivery. 
  In the development of the EFFU, we have been able to use 
CFRP 
components in the frame, develop a heat control system using 
fluid loops, develop element technologies for the equipment 
exchange unit, and to develop a system for conducting exposed 
environment testing. We have also been able to master system 
integration technologies for developing not only the JEM Exposed 
Facility but also other futuristic space vehicles.
