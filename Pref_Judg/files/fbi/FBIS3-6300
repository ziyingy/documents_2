  [Text] Tokyo, March 15 KYODO -- Japan is to grant Ecuador 
a total of 1,123 million yen to improve medical services and 
help buy equipment for a national theater, Foreign Ministry 
officials said Tuesday [15 March]. 
  Foreign Minister Tsutomu Hata and his counterpart from 
Ecuador, Diego Paredes Pena, exchanged documents on the 
assistance, which comprises 1,074 million yen for medical 
equipment in major hospitals and 49 million yen in cultural 
grant-in-aid for equipment for the national Sucre theater, the 
officials said. 
  There is a chronic shortage of medical equipment in major 
cities despite an increase in the number of patients, they said. 
  The Ecuadoran Government has a project to beef up medical 
equipment in major hospitals in three cities -- the capital city 
of Quito, Guayaquil and Portoviejo, and had asked Japan to help 
with equipment for surgery, gynecological treatment and for 
intensive care units, they said. 
  The aid will be used to pay for equipment for four of the 
eight hospitals in the three cities, they said. 
  It brings the total amount of Japanese grant-in-aid to 
Ecuador to some 1.6 billion yen, the officials said. 
  Meanwhile, the cultural grant-in-aid will be used to 
purchase 
sound, lighting and audiovisual equipment for the national Sucre 
theater in Quito, which has audiences totaling 40,000 people a 
year, they said.
