  [Text] According to estimates, in 1993 the Cuban Government 
paid 1.371 billion pesos in retirement and pension benefits and 
approximately 250 million pesos in maternity, accident, and 
sickness benefits. More than 1.271 million people received 
social security benefits in 1993, 53,000 more than in 1992. 
Every year, and despite the country's serious economic 
limitations, the social security expenses increase as do the 
number of people who benefit from this system. It is expected 
that 1.693 billion pesos will be allocated to the social 
security system in 1994. More than 1 billion pesos will be used 
to cover retirement and pension benefits.
