  [Text] Vietnam this year aims not to export wood in 
exchange for hard currency. It is trying to prevent further 
loss of forest cover. Minister of Forestry Nguyen Quang Ha 
recalled recent instructions by the prime minister banning the 
export of semi- finished materials intensive wood products. 
[sentence as heard] The minister also said the government might 
import wood in the years to come to boost local processing; this 
needs to be effectively administered and not to be an excuse for 
further deforestation.
