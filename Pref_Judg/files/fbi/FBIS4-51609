  [Text] Mae Hong Son -- A major battle between the Muang Tai 
Army [MTA] and Burmese forces is looming on the Thai-Burmese 
border. Khun Sa sent more troops to reinforce MTA fighters 
confronting Burmese soldiers on the banks of the Salween River 
earlier this week. 
  The Burmese army has mobilised troops near the area occupied 
by Khun Sa since last month. The opium warlord said the battle 
was expected in the second week of May. 
  "The confrontation is at Ban Namchang, Namtu, Hsenwi, 
Namhkam, Mong Tang and Mong Gne which are located on the eastern 
side of the Salween," he said after a blessing ceremony for the 
reinforcements. 
  About 3,200 fighters from the army's 12 infantries attended 
the ceremony which lasted three hours on Tuesday. He said they 
were the well-trained. 
  "The Shan State has been encircled by the Burmese forces for 
four months. There was occasional fighting with 300 soldiers 
killed and a large number of injuries on both sides and we have 
to send more troops." 
  Khun Sa acknowledged that he had a 20,000 strong army. 
  "The MTA has no other choice but to fight till the end. If 
we don't defend ourselves, the Burmese forces will intrude on 
our territory. We have to push them back." 
  An American dressed in a military uniform was seen during 
the 
ceremony. Peter Bond, as identified by Khun Sa, was a former 
consultant of the US Drug Enforcement Agency (DEA) who retired 
from the service. 
  "At one time, he treated me as drug kingpin. Now he just 
comes and has some meals with me," Khun Sa said. He refused to 
elaborate.
