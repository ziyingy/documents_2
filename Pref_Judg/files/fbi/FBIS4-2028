  [Text] Shanghai, April 4 (XINHUA) -- The valley of the 
Chang Jiang river, China's longest, has taken the lead in the 
country in trying out the joint-stock system. 
  The joint share-holding economy in Sichuan, Hunan, Hubei, 
Jiangxi, Anhui and Jiangsu provinces and Shanghai along the 
river has burgeoned since May 1992, when the central government 
announced the opening of this area further to the outside world. 
  By the end of March this year these areas had a total of 124 
companies that have listed their stocks on the market, 
accounting for half of the country's total. 
  These companies are involved in the fields of energy 
development, transportation, telecommunications and high-tech 
industry. They are leading local economic development and 
deepening the enterprise reform. 
  By issuing stocks to the public, the six provinces and 
Shanghai have collected more than 100 billion yuan in funds for 
local economic development. 
  The Pudong Development Bank, under the principle of 
management of both assets and liabilities, has loaned 3.57 
billion yuan and 160 million U.S. dollars to enterprises over 
the past year. 
  And the Gezhouba Hydroelectric Power Station on the middle 
reaches of the Chang Jiang is issuing stocks to collect funds 
for the construction of the giant Three Gorges dam project.
