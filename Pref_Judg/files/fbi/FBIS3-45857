  [Text] Yichang, January 21 (XINHUA) -- Yichang city, in 
central China's Hubei Province, has been approved by the central 
government to be the latest open city along the Chang Jiang 
river. 
  The approval entitles the city to all the preferential 
policies granted to coastal open cities. 
  The decision is the most recent major step by the central 
government to speed up the construction of the Three Gorges 
Project on the middle reaches of the Chang Jiang river, as well 
as to accelerate economic development in the region. 
  Yichang administers seven counties, three districts and a 
state- owned farm, and has a total population of more than 3.9 
million. 
  The city is well endowed with water resources. In addition 
to the Chang Jiang and Qing Jiang Rivers there are other 99 
smaller rivers. The city's exploitable water power is estimated 
at 30 million kw. 
  Yichang is the location of three major water projects and 
hydroelectric plants under construction, with installed capacity 
of 2.71 million kw for the Gezhouba water control project, 1.2 
million kw for the Geheyan hydropower plant and 18.2 million kw 
for the Three Gorges Project, the largest in the country. 
  The city also has many tourist attractions, including the 
picturesque landscape in the Three Gorges area and relics of 
ancient battlefields of the Three Kingdoms period (220-280).
