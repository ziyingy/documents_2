  [Abstract] Trajectory designs have traditionally involved a 
single-stage, one-impulse flight to halo orbit near libration 
points L[.sup]1[/] and L[.sub]2[/] of the Sun-Earth 
system. Launch parameters were chosen so that after boost near 
Earth, the spacecraft would enter a trajectory passing rather 
close to the libration points, with halo orbit C = 0. Other 
researchers have proposed designs that reduce the orbit-size 
parameters, with a rendezvous with the Moon not immediately 
after launch, but after a given number of revolutions in a 
highly elliptical orbit whose perigee is near the Earth and 
whose apogee distance is greater than the radius of the lunar 
orbit. The researchers here study the possible use of such a 
trajectory to perform the Relict-2 mission in the context of the 
constraints on the control system that is to be used in the 
mission. Analysis shows that a design with two revolutions in 
intermediate orbit is best for trajectories involving a lunar 
swing-by. The maximum size of the halo orbit for an October 
launch would be 250,000-310,000 km; for a November launch, 
180,000-220,000 km. Height of perigee for the first launch date 
would be less than 320 km; for the November launch, lower than 
300 km. The spacecraft would probably not be in the Earth's 
shadow for the first year. Figures 2, references 5: 3 Russian, 2
