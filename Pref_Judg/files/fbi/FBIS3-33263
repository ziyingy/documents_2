  [Text] The daily LA TRIBUNA reported this morning that the 
3-80 Northern Front, which was slated to discuss its disarmament 
with government representatives, has announced these talks have 
been suspended due to the strong presence of EPS [Sandinist 
People's Army] troops in the area of El Dorado. As yet, no date 
has been set for a new meeting between the rebels led by El 
Chacal [Jose Angel Talavera] and government representatives.
