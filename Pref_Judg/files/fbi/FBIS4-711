  [Text] The killing of innocent people in Kigali by MRND 
[Republican National Movement for Democracy and Development] 
youthwingers and Presidential Guards continues. In commune 
Bicyumbi, Kigali Prefecture, 350 people have been killed. The 
organizer is the chief of commune Bicyumbi, Mr. Juvenal 
Rugambarara. Yesterday, Chief Rugambarara killed 200 people who 
had taken refuge in a missionary station at a place called 
(Mushya). (Mushya) is in Commune Gikoro, which the neighboring

neighboring communes. 
  The Presidential Guards and the MRND youthwingers are 
conducting killings in other prefectures of Rwanda, notably 
Cyangugu and Gisenyi. These killings should be stopped before 
anybody can talk about a cease-fire between the Rwandese 
Patriotic Front and those killing the innocent people. Those 
calling for a cease-fire, either they are not willing or unable 
to stop the killing of innocent people in Rwanda. A cease-fire 
is not therefore a solution. The only option is to arrest the 
killers and restore law and order in the country.
