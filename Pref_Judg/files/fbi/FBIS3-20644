  [Text] A geophysical survey of the southern part of the 
South China Sea is paving the way for exploring the rich oil and 
natural gas resources there, according to a newspaper report. 
  The survey was organized by the Chinese geological and 
mineral departments, which have since 1987 organized a series of 
explorations in the region, the overseas edition of PEOPLE'S 
DAILY said yesterday. 
  Four exploratory missions conducted in the area by the 
surveying ships Haiyang-4 and Fengdou-4 have collected sea 
depth, gravity, and magnetic data in the Zengmu and Wanan basins 
of the Nansha Islands. 
  In addition, the Nanhai Sea Research Institute under the 
Chinese Academy of Sciences also conducted geophysical 
explorations in the region. 
  Last year, the Chinese scientists evaluated the six tectonic 
oil-bearing structures in the Wanan Basin, providing valuable 
data for further exploration of oil and gas resources in the 
area. (CD News)
