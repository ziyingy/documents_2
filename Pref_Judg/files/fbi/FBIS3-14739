  [Text] An agreement has been signed in Ashgabat on sending 
2.3 billion cubic meters of natural gas to Azerbaijan in 1994. 
In a statement to an AZERTAC correspondent, Zeynalov, vice 
president of the Azergas Company [Azerbaijan Natural Gas 
Company], said that Azerbaijan planned to receive 3 billion 
cubic meters of natural gas. The supply will be a little less 
because of Turkmenistan's request that we repay 700 million 
cubic meters of the natural gas we wish to buy in the form of 
diesel oil. However, there is a great demand for diesel oil in 
Azerbaijan. In view of this, we were unable to agree to that 
proposal. The sides are currently working to change the 
agreement. Our republic will receive another 700 million cubic 
meters of natural gas if an agreement is reached on repaying 
that amount with other products. 
  Zeynalov also said that Azerbaijan received 6.3 million 
cubic 
meters of natural gas from Turkmenistan on 22 February.
