  [Text] Chiang Rai police yesterday seized a large cache of 
assault rifles and ammunition, and arrested a man who claimed 
the weapons were destined for drug warlord Khun Sa for use 
against Burmese government troops. 
  The 267 AK-47 rifles and ammunition were worth an estimated 
Bt[baht]3 million, police said. They had come from the 
Cambodian border area and were to be resold for profit. 
  Police said the arrested man Thanong Phrapphradon, 29, of Sa 
Kaeo province, said that the weapons belong to Somphong Songsuk, 
23, of the same province. 
  Thanong was travelling in a six-wheel truck with another man 
when police at a checkpoint in Chiang Rai's Mae Chan district 
signalled them to stop. 
  The vehicle allegedly drove through the barricade. Police 
chased the vehicle, which they later found abandoned. The two 
men were running away. Thanong was arrested but his comrade is 
still at large. 
  The weapons were found in the back of the truck hidden under 
a pile of pumpkins.
