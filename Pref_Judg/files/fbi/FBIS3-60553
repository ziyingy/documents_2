  [Text] The incidence of measles is continuing to rise in 
some areas of the country despite an alert to parents to have 
their children vaccinated after an epidemic in Dublin earlier 
this year. 
  However, the overall number of cases reported to the 
Department of Health has fallen since the start of the summer. 
  So far this year, there have been 3,493 cases of measles 
reported countrywide compared to just 179 last year. 
  A major alert about the potentially serious disease was 
issued as the school year began last September and this 
triggered an increase in the number of parents having their 
children vaccinated. 
  Feedback from a number of health boards suggests supplies of 
the vaccine were in much greater demand than usual, but the fear 
is there will be a fall-off once the attention abates. 
  The North Western Health Board confirmed yesterday the 
number 
of cases reported there in the last couple of weeks had 
increased. 
  ``It is not an epidemic but there has been a definite rise 
in 
the level of cases of the disease,'' a spokesman said. 
  He said more than 100 cases were reported in the last four 
weeks in the Inishowen, Letterkenny and Fanad areas. 
  The spokesman again appealed to parents to have children 
over 
the age of 15 months vaccinated. They should also look out for 
symptoms of measles in their children and keep them at home from 
school because it was so infectious. 
  The vaccination rate in the North Western Health Board area 
is relatively high and is around 95pc in some regions.
