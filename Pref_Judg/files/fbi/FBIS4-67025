  [Excerpts] Drugs are now so widely available in British 
prisons that drug-free wings are being established. They will 
allow inmates a refuge from the dangers of addiction and 
drug-related violence. 
  Prisoners are only allowed into the wings if they sign 
contracts agreeing to abstain from drugs and alcohol and to 
provide urine samples for testing. 
  The number of drug finds inside prisons increased by more 
than 50 percent to 4,585 last year. Michael Howard, the home 
secretary, has identified drug abuse as one of the most serious 
problems facing the prison service. [passage omitted] 
  The setting up of the drugs-free wings is partly a response 
to a report on Long Lartin by Judge Stephen Tumim, the chief 
inspector of prisons, in December 1992. This said: "The prison 
was suffering from an epidemic of hard drug-taking. Incidents of 
discovery of large quantities of drugs were frequent, while 
stories of substance abuse abounded." It added: "Homemade 
`hooch' was sometimes consumed in front of the staff, yet prison 
rules expressly forbid prisoners to have any intoxicating 
liquor." [passage omitted] 
  If the scheme is a success, inmates from other prisons may 
be 
allowed to request transfers to the drug-free wing at Long 
Lartin. 
  At Swaleside prison, a medium-to-high risk jail on the Isle 
of Sheppey in Kent, a similar scheme is due to start in May. 
  Other jails are monitoring the scheme with a view to 
establishing their own drug-free wings. [passage omitted]
