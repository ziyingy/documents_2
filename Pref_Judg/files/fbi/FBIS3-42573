1993--Oil Exports Increased by 20 Percent"] 
  [Text] In 1993, Russia's foreign trade turnover, taking 
into account approximate estimates of exports and imports by 
private parties, amounted to $76.2 billion (U.S.) and increased 
by 0.3 percent in current prices as compared to 1992. 
  Exports amounted to $45.9 billion and increased by 13 
percent, while imports fell off by 15 percent--to $30.3 billion. 
  Russia's main trading partners were industrially developed 
countries, which in 1993 accounted for 59 percent of total 
Russian exports--$27.2 billion, which is 14 percent more than in 
1992. Exports to Germany amounted to $5.9 billion (100 percent 
as compared to 1992), Italy--$3.2 billion (107 percent), Great 
Britain--$2.2 billion (97 percent), United States--$2.1 billion 
(297 percent), and Japan--$2.0 billion (125 percent). 
  Exports to developing countries amounted to $6.4 billion and 
increased by 54 percent. Exports to other countries (former CEMA 
countries, the republics of former Yugoslavia, China, the DPRK, 
and the Baltic countries) amounted to $12.3 billion (a 3 percent 
decline); only exports to China increased to $3.3 billion (by 20 
percent). 
  In 1993, Russia exported 21 percent more oil than in 1992 
(18.2 percent of the total volume of exports), 3 percent more 
natural gas (15.1 percent), and 36 percent more petroleum 
products (7.5 percent). Export of machinery and equipment 
dropped off by almost a factor of four (6.1 percent of the total 
volume). 
  In 1993, Russia imported $30.3 billion worth of products, 
which is 15 percent less in current prices than in 1992. 
  The total value of goods imported from industrially 
developed 
countries in 1993 was $18.5 billion, or 18 percent less than 
1992, including from Germany--$6.9 billion (a 2 percent 
increase); from the United States--$2.2 billion (a 16 percent 
decrease); from Japan--$1.8 billion (a 5 percent increase); from 
Italy--$1.4 billion (a 54 percent decrease); and from 
France--$1.2 billion (a 7 percent decrease). 
  Imports from developing countries increased by 22 percent to 
$5.5 billion, and those from other countries declined by 23 
percent to $6.3 billion. China was an exception: Imports of 
Chinese-produced goods increased by 55 percent to $2.6 billion. 
Imports from Bulgaria, Poland, Romania, Slovakia, the Czech 
Republic, and the republics of the former Yugoslavia fell off by 
a factor of two or more. 
  Grain imports fell to a record low for the past few 
years--11 
million tonnes (5.2 percent of the total volume); purchases of 
machinery and equipment dropped off almost by half (21.7 
percent). Clothing comprised 3.2 percent of all imports, and 
sugar--2.7 percent. 
  Foreign trade balance was positive in 1993 and amounted to 
$15.6 billion (in 1992 it was also positive and amounted to $5.3 
billion). 
  Russia's total trade turnover with the republics of the 
former USSR amounted to 22.5 trillion rubles [R]. The positive 
balance in Russia's trade with CIS partners amounted to R5.249 
trillion (in current prices). The greatest disbalance has 
developed in trade with Ukraine--R3.7 trillion, Kazakhstan--R972 
billion, and Belarus--R239 billion.
