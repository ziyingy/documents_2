  [Text] Before 2 May, the government might again declare a 
state of internal disturbance. Special measures would have to 
be taken to prevent -- for the third time -- the possible mass 
release of terrorists and drug traffickers from the country's 
prisons. 
  In a letter, the attorney general [Carlos Gustavo Arrieta] 
warned the prosecutor general [Gustavo de Greiff] that if the 
legal situation is not defined for narcoterrorists and 
guerrillas, who have been held for 180 days as of 2 May, they 
will have to be released from jail, according to the new law. 
That mass release of suspected criminals has again alarmed the 
government, which does not rule out a declaration of a state of 
internal disturbance to prevent the release of drug traffickers 
and terrorists. [begin recording] 
  Government Minister Fabio Villegas: The government 
would evaluate the situation with the Prosecutor General's 
Office and would jointly make relevant decisions with that 
office. 
  Unidentified reporter: Has the declaration of a 
state of internal disturbance been ruled out? 
  Villegas: We are not ruling it out nor are we 
stating that it is going to be decreed. [end recording] 
  On another topic, the government minister described as 
absurd 
the assertions of confessed drug trafficker Gabriel Taboada in 
Washington and he criticized the position of U.S. Senator John 
Kerry. [begin recording] 
  Villegas: It is absurd and incomprehensible that a 
U.S. senator values the opinion of a criminal, a confessed 
criminal, more than this country's record in the struggle 
against drug trafficking. [end recording] 
  For the government, it is clear the struggle against drug 
trafficking will continue without rest, and not just to please 
someone in particular.
