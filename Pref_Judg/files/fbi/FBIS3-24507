  [Abstract] Reports that optimum gas transport control of a 
gas main may help lower the power consumption for housekeeping 
needs by up to 1% prompted the development of a 
principally new 
technique and mathematical model and algorithms for on-line 
optimum control of the gas main operating conditions in the case 
with successively positioned compressor stations equipped with 
centrifugal gas transfer plants (GPA). The desired effect is 
achieved by ensuring the optimum compressor station inlet and 
outlet gas pressures with changes in the gas flow or other 
transported gas parameters. The technique for on-line control of 
the gas main (MG) operating conditions is described in detail; 
three stages are considered: developing the optimum 
energy-economic characteristics (EEKhKS) for each compressor 
station (KS), establishing the optimum gas pressures on the 
basis of the mathematical model of the gas main and the above 
optimum compressor station energy-economic characteristics, and 
establishing the optimum inlet and outlet gas flows transported 
through the transfer plants at each compressor stations. It is 
suggested that the models be implemented on microcomputers which 
may be placed at dispatcher control centers and that changes in 
the process parameters be taken into account directly in the 
course of operation. Figures 2; references 5.
