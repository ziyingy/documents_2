  [Text] London -- Foreign Minister Guido Di Tella's 
"innocent" three-day trip to England to visit his son Rafael has 
yielded other results. He discovered that John Major's 
administration considers the issue of negotiations with the 
Menem administration on the issue of oil around the Malvinas 
Island "convenient but not indispensable" and that the United 
Kingdom is "ready" to lift the arms embargo imposed on Argentina 
since the Malvinas war. 
  CLARIN talked with Di Tella, who was staying at the 
Argentine 
Embassy residence in Paris and will arrive back in Buenos Aires 
this morning. 
  [CLARIN] What are the results of your meeting with Foreign 
and Commonwealth Affairs Secretary Douglas Hurd? 
  [Di Tella] I had a long meeting with him and ended up 
clarifying two important issues: negotiations on oil 
exploration, which will have a busy agenda, and the issue of 
relations with Chile. It was established that we will cooperate. 
They consider British-Argentine negotiations "convenient but not 
indispensable," and we consider them "indispensable." The two 
countries have agreed that it is "convenient." 
  [CLARIN] Has Hurd offered you seismic prospecting results or 
told you how much oil there is in the islands? 
  [Di Tella] They have not been very explicit and they have 
not 
given me any seismic prospecting work. They assured us that they 
are still not sure how much oil there is in the area. 
  [CLARIN] Did he reproach you for Argentina's "theft" of the 
seismic prospecting carried out on orders of the island's 
government through an Argentine ghost company? 
  [Di Tella] They did not complain. On the other hand, it was 
not a ghost company but a YPF [Government Oil Deposits] 
subsidiary. I cannot recall the name of the company now. 
  [CLARIN] Did you establish an agenda to discuss the oil 
situation? 
  [Di Tella] There is "a verbal agreement." But never before 
was the "convenience" of negotiating the issue of oil 
exploration mentioned so explicitly. A technical team will meet 
in April to discuss these questions. 
  [CLARIN] Great Britain's problem is that insurance companies 
refuse to insure "off shore" [preceding two words in English] 
explorations in conflict zones such as the area around the 
Malvinas Islands. In the back of their minds they have the ghost 
of what happened with Kuwait's oil wells, which were set on fire 
by the Iraqis. How will Argentina take advantage of this 
situation in negotiations for the Malvinas Islands? 
  [Di Tella] Argentina can create serious juridical problems 
for Great Britain in the South Atlantic. We are going to do just 
that. The British Government is at a point where it must discuss 
the issue of oil exploration with us. Our "warning notes" on the 
matter have worried companies in the area. 
  [CLARIN] Are you using that as a future threat? 
  [Di Tella] It is not a threat. That is life...If you push a 
door bell you will hear a noise...I will take every legal step 
possible to achieve our objective. 
  [CLARIN] Did you discuss the Argentine Government's 
apprehensions about British interference in Argentine-Chilean 
relations? 
  [Di Tella] That was one of the main reasons for my trip and 
my interest in seeing Hurd. It was one of the topics on our 
agenda. I talked to him about the excellent status of 
Argentine-Chilean relations and the need we have for Great 
Britain to help consolidate it. 
  [CLARIN] What did Hurd say about Margaret Thatcher's visit 
to 
Chile in the next few days? 
  [Di Tella] Hurd told me that Mrs. Thatcher is going to Chile 
because "she feels like it." Maggie has "never" (in English), 
and least of all now, accepted pressure from anyone. She is 
promoting her "Memories" and has made more than 3 million pounds 
from it. For her the monetary issue is very important. She 
cannot be pressured, least of all by John Major's government. 
  [CLARIN] Why will Hurd travel to Malvinas if 
British-Argentine relations are so good? 
  [Di Tella] Hurd simply told me: "I have been in the post for 
five years and never visited the islands. Besides you are very 
active diplomatically and you visit us every three months." I 
am highly encouraged to see that my "charming [preceding word in 
English] operation" is yielding these results. 
  [CLARIN] According to British sources, the Major government 
is ready to sell arms to Argentina. 
  [Di Tella] They can offer them. We do not have any problems. 
We want an end to the arms embargo. In this visit to London I 
had the impression that the arms embargo issue will soon be a 
thing of the past.
