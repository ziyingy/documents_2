<F P=106> [Report issued by the Economic Department of the Cabinet of </F>
Ministers of Ukraine under the rubric "The Economy": "The 
Economy of Ukraine in January--October 1993"] 
  [Text] The economic situation in Ukraine remains extremely 
critical. Industrial production is continuing to fall, the 
financial state of enterprises and organizations is worsening, 
Ukraine's state budget deficit is growing, and monetary emission 
is sharply rising, further exacerbating the economic crisis in 
the country. 
<H5>  EXECUTION OF THE BUDGET </H5>
  The state budget continues to be heavily burdened by 
inflation, which is causing the deficit to continue climbing 
sharply. This deficit is being financed with credit flows from 
the National Bank. 
  Consolidated budget revenues for 
January--September totalled 16,897 billion karbovantsi. The 
budget was supplemented by an additional 6,065 billion 
karbovantsi in bank credits used to finance the planned deficit 
and a number of other expenditures. Of this sum, 5,603 billion 
karbovantsi were credits issued by the National Bank and 760 
billion karbovantsi were issued by the Prominvestbank of Ukraine. 
  Value-added tax brought in 6,315 billion karbovantsi, 
profits 
tax from enterprises and organizations--4,398 billion, excise 
taxes--773 billion, personal income taxes--746 billion, 
contributions from enterprises and organizations to the Fund for 
Implementing Measures To Liquidate the ffects of the Chernobyl 
Catastrophe and To Provide Social Security for the 
Population--700 billion, and income from external economic 
activity--635 billion karbovantsi. 
  The mobilization of revenues into the budget is proceeding 
with difficulty: a substantial number of enterprises, 
organizations, and institutions, as well as private citizens, 
violate the tax laws, underreport their real income and profits, 
and fail to make payments into the budget in due time. Seventy 
percent of all taxpayers who have been audited were found to 
have violated the tax laws. 
  In January--September, late payments into the budget 
totalled 
1,334 billion karbovantsi. 
  During the nine months in question consolidated budget 
expenditures amounted to 20,544 billion karbovantsi. 
  In the execution of Ukraine's consolidated budget, 
expenditures exceeded revenues by 3,647 billion karbovantsi. 
  The state budget for January--September was 
executed in terms of revenues in the amount of 9,086 billion 
karbovantsi and in terms of expenditures, in the amount of 
13,699 billion karbovantsi. 
  Value-added tax brought in 3,308 billion karbovantsi, 
profits 
tax from enterprises and organizations--1,781 billion 
karbovantsi, and excise taxes--342 billion karbovantsi. 
  Outlays for social security measures totalled 1,239 billion; 
education, culture, health care, physical culture, and 
sports--897 billion; defense--979 billion; science--197 billion; 
and the national economy--3,749 billion karbovantsi. 
  Bank credit resources were used to extend 865 billion 
karbovantsi in loans to the Pension Fund for pension payments, 
270 billion karbovantsi for subsidies to the coal industry, 
2,578 billion for subsidies and price indexation in the 
agroindustrial complex, 750 billion for replacement of material 
reserves, and 1,601 billion karbovantsi for other measures. 
  These loans included, total expenditures in the state budget 
in the nine-month period amounted to 14,378 billion karbovantsi 
and exceeded revenues by 5,281 billion karbovantsi as against 
the approved budget deficitfor the year of 983 
billion karbovantsi. 
<H5>  EXTENSION OF CREDIT TO THE NATIONAL ECONOMY </H5>
  On 1 October, the amount of credit extended by 
Ukraine's banks (financial obligation on loans) totalled 37.9 
trillion karbovantsi, of which 7.5 trillion had been granted by 
the National Bank and 30.4 trillion by commercial banks. 
  Credit extended by branches of foreign commercial banks from 
former oviet states amounted to 73.5 billion karbovantsi. 
  During September, the amount of extended credit increased by 
9.1 trillion karbovantsi (32 percent), of which the amount 
extended by the National Bank grew by 1.5 trillion (25 percent) 
and the amount granted by commercial banks rose by 7.6 trillion 
(33 percent). At the beginning of October, commercial banks 
accounted for 80 percent of all credits as against 79 percent on 
1 September and 56 percent at the start of the year. 
  Increased borrowing from the National Bank was necessitated 
by the growing state budget deficit and the lack of funds in the 
Pension Fund for making pension payments. 
  The unstable economic situation and the high rate of 
inflation are causing a drop in the long-term credit that is 
being invested by commercial banks in economic growth. Compared 
with the beginning of the year, when long-term loans accounted 
for five percent of all loans, their share fell to two percent 
in September. 
  As of 1 October, the amount of credit issued by the National 
Bank for the refinancing of commercial banks was 9.1 
trillion karbovantsi (financial obligation on loans). Most of 
this amount (97 percent) had been granted to the Ukrayina Bank 
to be used in extending credit lines. 
  With the official settlement rate for commercial bank 
refinancing set at 240 percent, the actual interest rate in 
September rose to nearly the set level and amounted to 239.9 
percent as compared with 55 percent in August, chiefly because 
no preferential rates for refinancing commercial banks were 
offered in September. 
  Accordingly, the average interest rate on loans at 
commercial 
banks rose by 19.5 percentage points and amounted to 222.5 
percent as compared with 203 percent in August of this year. The 
maximum interest rate in September was 600 percent (480 percent 
in August), and the minimum rate was 5 percent (1 percent in 
August). 
<H5>  THE FINANCIAL STATE OF ENTERPRISES AND ORGANIZATIONS </H5>
  The total amount of interenterprise debt in the current year 
increased 21.7-fold (in September--93 percent) and on 1 October 
amounted to 48.3 trillion karbovantsi; loan debt increased 
19.7-fold (24.6 percent) and totalled 44.5 trillion karbovantsi. 
  Debts between enterprises and organizations in Ukraine 
and economic entities in countries making up the former 
USSR increased 32 percent in September and amounted to 3.4 
trillion karbovantsi at the beginning of October. During the 
same period, indebtedness to lenders fell 13 percent and 
totalled 7.5 trillion karbovantsi. Since the beginning of the 
year, loan debt has increased 22-fold and interenterprise debt 
eightfold. 
  Interenterprise and loan debt between enterprises and 
organizations inside Ukraine is growing. During 
January--September, interenterprise debt increased 25-fold 
(doubling in September) and at the beginning of October amounted 
to 44.9 trillion karbovantsi, while loan debt increased 19-fold 
(36 percent in September) and amounted to 37 trillion 
karbovantsi. 
  The amount of overdue interenterprise debt on clearing 
transactions and of overdue bank loans increased fourfold 
since the beginning of the year. Just in September, this amount 
rose nearly 33.3 percent and on 1 October totalled 1,761.4 
billion karbovantsi. Of this sum, 1,111.5 billion karbovantsi 
(63 percent) was debt on clearing transactions between 
enterprises and organizations, and 649.8 billion karbovantsi (37 
percent) was the amount in overdue payments on bank loans. 
<H5>  THE CURRENCY MARKET </H5>
  Due to a drop in the amounts of foreign currencies offered 
for sale at the Ukrainian Interbank Currency Exchange, the 
volume of sales of these currencies dropped significantly in 
September and the exchange rates of these currencies against the 
Ukrainian karbovanets rose accordingly. 
  Sales of U.S. dollars fell 22.2 percent compared with August 
and more than twofold compared with July. Sales of German marks 
fell 8-4-fold and 6.5-fold and of Russian rubles 1.9-fold and 
3.4-fold, respectively. 
  In October, the exchange rate of the karbovanets against 
foreign currencies continued to drop and by the end of the month 
amounted to 31,000 karbovantsi to one U.S. dollar (as compared 
with the official rate set by the National Bank of 5,970 
karbovantsi), 19,300 karbovantsi to one German mark (official 
rate--3,720.80 karbovantsi), 25 karbovantsi to one Russian ruble 
(official rate--5.61 karbovantsi), or 5.2-fold, 5.2-fold, and 
4.5-fold below the official rate, respectively. 
  In accordance with the president's edict "On Additional 
Measures To Improve Currency Controls" and as a way of promoting 
the development of the currency market and stabilizing the 
currency exchange rate, a recommendation was made to the 
National Bank to temporarily suspend currency auctions at the 
Ukrainian Interbank Currency Exchange. 
<H5>  PERFOMANCE OF INDIVIDUAL BRANCHES OF THE NATIONAL ECONOMY </H5>
  Industrial output is continuing to decline. During 
January--October, the volume of goods produced fell 8.1 percent 
against the corresponding period of last year. Production 
volumes have dropped at more than half of all enterprises. The 
output of 130 of the 146 most essential kinds of industrial 
products has been reduced. 
  The situation in the oil refining industry remains 
critical. The volume of crude oil refined is continually 
decreasing. Since the beginning of the year, 20.3 million metric 
tons of crude oil have been refined, which represents a drop of 
40.9 percent as compared with last year. As a result, the 
production of gasoline fell 35.7 percent, diesel fuel--27.6 
percent, and furnace oil--41.7 percent. 
  Fuel supplies at electric power stations decreased 
significantly in October. Compared with last year, deliveries of 
gas fell to one-half of their previous level, coal deliveries 
dropped 22.5 percent, and only 7 percent of the planned amounts 
of furnace oil were delivered. 
  The financial status of energy enterprises is being further 
exacerbated by the disarray in settling accounts. In October, 
the amount owed by energy consumers grew from 384 billion to 561 
billion karbovantsi, while overdue payments for fuel by energy 
enterprises rose from 345 billion to 670 billion karbovantsi. 
  The harvesting of crops is nearly complete. By 8 
November, Ukraine's farms had threshed more than 41 million 
metric tons of grain (excluding corn), exceeding last year's 
figure by 5 million metric tons, or 14 percent. This increase 
was the result of a higher yield, which amounted to 34.6 
centners as compared with 29.9 centners last year. 
  According to Ministry of Agriculture and Food estimates, the 
gross yield of grain (including corn) is expected to reach 45 
million metric tons (weight after harvesting has been completed). 
  Other crops harvested include 35.2 million metric tons of 
sugar beets (22 percent more than last year), 2.9 million metric 
tons of potatoes (3 percent less than last year), and 2 million 
metric tons each of suflowers and vegetables (the same amounts 
as last year). 
  Still unharvested on 8 November were 6,200 hectares of sugar 
beets, 600 hectares of potatoes, 7,900 hectares of sunflowers, 
13,000 hectares of vegetables, and 159,500 hectares of corn for 
seed. 
  Fourteen million metric tons of grain crops (96 percent of 
the state order) were procured by the state. This 
amount exceeds the 1992 figure by 3.1 million metric tons. Farms 
in 16 oblasts executed the state order. 
  By 18 October, the state had purchased 534,400 metric tons 
of 
potatoes (30 percent less than last year), 1.1 million metric 
tons of vegetables (8 percent less), and 319,700 metric tons of 
fruit (2 percent less). 
  The decline in the output of livestock products is 
continuing. During the last 10 months, farms have produced 
2,180,100 metric tons of meat (live weight), which is 22 percent 
less than last year, 10,250,000 metric tons of milk (11 percent 
less), and 5,225.5 million eggs (18 percent less). 
  The state has procured 2,019,000 metric tons of meat (23 
percent less than for the same period last year), 9,473,000 
metric tons of milk (10 percent less), and 4,356 million eggs 
(15 percent less). 
  The state order for the procurement of cattle and poultry 
has 
been met 71 percent, for milk--89 percent, and for eggs--75 
percent. 
  During January--September of this year, the total volume of 
foreign trade turnover with former Soviet states 
amounted to 26.3 trillion karbovantsi, of which exports 
accounted for 8.5 trillion and imports for 17.8 trillion, 
producing a negative foreign trade balance in the amount of 9.3 
trillion karbovantsi (mainly as a result of the need to import 
natural gas, oil and oil products, polyethylene, lumber, cotton, 
rolled aluminum, and synthetic rubber). A negative trade balance 
exists with Russia (6 trillion karbovantsi), Turkmenistan (1.8 
trillion), Uzbekistan (1.2 trillion), as well as with 
Azerbaijan, Belarus, Kazakhstan, Lithuania, Tajikistan, and 
Estonia. 
  In trade with other countries, exports exceeded imports in 
the amount of 4.7 trillion karbovantsi. 
  Since the beginning of the year, the average monthly 
wage of employees in the state sector rose 13-fold and 
amounted to 197,000 karbovantsi in September. Wages are lowest 
for employees in the public catering, culture, art, social 
security, agriculture, trade, housing services, public 
education, and health care sectors, where they range from 
124,000 to 169,000 karbovantsi (Supplement 3). 
  In September, the minimum wage (20,000 karbovantsi) amounted 
to only 10 percent and the minimum pension (40,000 karbovantsi) 
to only 19.9 percent of the cost of the minimum consumption 
budget. In October, after paying rent and public utilities, 
recipients of the minimum pension rate had only enough left to 
buy 250 grams of bread and 13 grams of cooked sausage per day or 
500 grams of bread and half a liter of milk. 
  The worsening economic situation in the country is 
accompanied by the rise of negative demographic 
trends. Compared with the same period last year, during 
January--September the number of births fell by 23,900, or 5.3 
percent; the birth rate per 1,000 dropped 0.6 percent. At the 
same time, the number of deaths rose by 30,200, or 5.8 percent; 
the population's death rate rose 0.7 percent. 
  The natural decrease in population amounted to 120,300 
persons, which represents an increase of 82 percent over the 
corresponding period of last year.
