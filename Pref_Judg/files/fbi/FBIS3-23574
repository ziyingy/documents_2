<F P=106> [Article by Lieutenant-Colonel V. Veselov, member, </F>
Scientific-Technical Committee, Russian Federation Ministry of 
Defense Central Missile Fuels Directorate, under rubric 
"Official Section: Documents and Commentary": "Tank and 
Container Storage Periods for POL"] 
  [Text] It is difficult to overestimate the role of fuel 
quality control in ensuring reliable, long-lived, accident-free 
operation of Army and Navy arms and military equipment. Tank and 
container storage periods for POL are important starting points 
for such quality control. 
  The new "Instruktsiya po obespecheniyu kachestva goryuchego 
v 
VS RF" [Instruction for Quality Assurance of Fuel in the Russian 
Federation Armed Forces] attached even greater significance to 
these periods (shown in the table). Previous guidance documents 
envisaged three kinds of laboratory analysis: Check analysis, 
complete analysis and arbitrary analysis. Fuel stored within 
standard period limits will be subjected to depot analysis, 
which in terms of storage status plays the role of a complete 
analysis. A complete analysis will be performed for an in-depth 
study of quality at the expiration of periods and, of course, 
before putting a product up for lengthy storage as well as in a 
number of other cases.

Notes: 

*12 years for A-72. 

1. Climatic areas of former USSR territory are specified by requirements of GOST 16350 "USSR Climate. Zoning 
and Statistical Parameters of Climatic Factors for Technical Purposes." 

2. POL storage conditions should conform to requirements of GOST 1510. 

3. Storage periods for POL not indicated in this table are determined according to its standard technical 
documentation. 


  Fuel storage periods also are reference points for drawing 
up 
a turnover plan. At the same time, except for aircraft fuel, it 
is not the expiration of periods, but a deterioration of quality 
indicators and their approach to admissible limiting values 
under GOST (TU) [State Standard (Technical Specifications)] that 
is the basis for turnover. 
  With the exception of aviation fuel, fuel storage periods 
may 
be extended one year if by the end of a period the fuel conforms 
to GOST (TU) requirements for all quality indicators to the 
extent of a complete analysis and has a quality margin for the 
indicators most inclined to change. At the expiration of the 
extended period, the storage period again may be extended for 
one year if the fuel has a quality margin based on data of a 
complete analysis. 
  Oils, lubricants and special fluids which have arrived in 
sealed and other airtight packaging (tubes, cans, bottles) may 
be stored and issued for use for arms and military equipment 
without analyses during the prescribed storage period based on a 
supplier plant's certificates. 
  Quality alone, not storage periods, is taken into account in 
deciding questions of using fuel.
