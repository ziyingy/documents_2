  [Text] Chisinau BASAPRESS, 9/6/1994 -- "We consider that 
the discussion itself on the granting of a special juridical 
status to districts populated by the Gagauz ethnics or to the 
Dniester region emerged through the pressure of the Russian 
empire, which is trying to stimulate separatism in Moldova," 
declared to BASAPRESS Iurie Rosca, the leader of the Alliance of 
Christian Democratic People's Front of Moldova [AFPCDM]. The 
members of the AFPCDM consider that the Gagauz issue can be 
solved by adopting a regulation, which would represent the 
interests of national minorities. "Such a law exists: It was 
adopted by the former parliament and was named the Law on 
National Minorities," mentioned Rosca, adding that 
decentralization of state power would contribute to a faster 
settlement of the dispute with the Southern districts. Rosca 
also declared that the adoption of a special juridical status 
for the Southern districts will mark the beginning of the 
federalization of the republic. "The AFPCDM will oppose this 
draft bill," declared Rosca.
