[2455 3123 3293]: ``Huajing Develops 5-Inch Single-Crystal 
Silicon''] 
  [Summary] Scientists at the China Huajing Electronics Group 
recently developed 5-inch single-crystal silicon wafers. As 
tested by an expert panel and by customers, this material's main 
technical performance exceeds the international general-purpose 
SEMI [Semiconductor Equipment and Materials Institute] materials 
standards. This world-class product, costing one-third less than 
the equivalent imported item, can be used for manufacturing 
2-3-æm-linewidth VLSI circuits. The Huajing scientists 
reported their achievement at the recently held National 
Semiconductor and Integrated Circuit Silicon Materials 
Conference.
