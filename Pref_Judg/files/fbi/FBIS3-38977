<F P=106> [Report by John Carvel in Brussels: "French Threaten </F>
Euro-Poll Fiasco"] 
  [Text] British elections to the European Parliament are in 
danger of turning into a fiasco because of a row about the 
future location of the parliament between Edouard Balladur, the 
French prime minister, and the majority of MEPs [Members of the 
European Parliament]. 
  Orders will be passed through the Commons this week to fix 
the boundaries of 87 Euro-constituencies to replace the United 
Kingdom's present 81 seats, for polling on June 9. However, 
ministers have been warned the old boundaries may have to be 
reinstated unless the Balladur row is resolved, forcing new 
candidate selections weeks before the election. 
  The Edinburgh summit in 1992 agreed to increase the number 
of 
MEPs to allow representation for eastern Germany. Britain and 
other states upheld national pride by ensuring they too could 
elect more MEPs. 
  Under European Union [EU] rules, the deal falls if not 
ratified by all 12 states. Mr Balladur has told Helmut Kohl, 
the German Chancellor, that France will withhold ratification 
unless the French city of Strasbourg becomes the parliament's 
permanent home. He is demanding Egon Klepsch, the German MEP 
who is the parliament's president, sign a binding contract to 
lease a 225 million pound building which the French want to 
construct in Strasbourg. 
  Non-French MEPs think it would be folly to build another 
parliament. They would prefer to be in Brussels, to oversee the 
Commission, where 600 million pounds is being spent on a 
building already partly completed. 
  Mr Klepsch cannot sign without the approval of various 
parliamentary committees which have not even started to consider 
the matter. 
  The member states' 12 ambassadors to the EU decided last 
week 
it was inconceivable that the elections should leave out eastern 
Germany. It is likely that governments will put heavy pressure 
on MEPs to give way to Mr Balladur.
