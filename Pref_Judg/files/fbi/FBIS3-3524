  [Text] Hangzhou, March 18 (XINHUA) -- Ningbo port in East 
China's Zhejiang Province has become one of the country's 
largest with more than 50 million tons of cargo handled annually 
over the last three years. 
  Ningbo port, which consists of beilun port, Zhenhai port and 
old Ningbo port, has docks for crude oil, mineral ore, 
containers and chemicals. With 51 berths capable of handling 
vessels up to 150,000 dwt, its annual handling volume now 
exceeds 50 million tons. 
  In 1993, Ningbo opened routes to Qingdao and Yantai in 
Shandong Province, Northern China. 
  It serves as a transfer terminal for China's largest steel 
and iron complexes in Shanghai, Wuhan and Beijing. 
  Striving to build itself into "the Rotterdam of the East", 
Ningbo has also opened routes to 239 ports in 65 countries and 
regions.
