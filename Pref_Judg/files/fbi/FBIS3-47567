  [Text] Tokyo, Jan. 13 KYODO -- Japan and Russia will 
discuss bilateral cooperation on environmental protection in 
Tokyo from January 26 to 27, Japanese Government officials said 
Thursday [13 January]. 
  Among topics are prevention of air and water pollution, 
disposal of harmful waste and preservation of Siberian forests 
to help prevent global warming, the officials said. 
  The talks are aimed at working out concrete projects for 
bilateral cooperation, they said. 
  In Russia's Far East region, about 800,000 hectares of trees 
are cut down annually, posing a threat to forests which are said 
to keep global warming in check. 
  Also part of the frozen soil in Siberia has melted recently 
to release methane gas, a substance said to promote global 
warming. 
  Japan has carried out a joint survey since 1992 to measure 
the density of methane in the air above Siberia. 
  The Japanese team at the talks will consist of officials of 
the Foreign Ministry, the International Trade and Industry 
Ministry and the Environment Agency. The Russian delegation 
will be from the Environmental Protection and Natural Resources 
Ministry. 
  The meeting will be the first on cooperation on the 
environment since Japan and the former Soviet Union signed an 
agreement on such deals when then Soviet President Mikhail 
Gorbachev visited Japan in April 1991, they said.
