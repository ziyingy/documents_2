<H5>  A. Overview </H5>
  The promotion of scientific research that centers around 
universities is a way to improve the levels of learning and to 
uncover new knowledge. It is very important as a means of 
forming a foundation for development in various social and 
national fields of interest. 
  In recent years the importance of basic research as the 
foundation that will support 21st-century Japan has been 
strongly perceived, and there are increasing expectations toward 
scientific research in every area of society. With this there is 
a need to further promote creative, pioneering scientific 
research and to actively contribute to the advance of the 
world's scientific research in correspondence with the expansion 
of Japan's international role. 
  Accordingly, the Ministry of Education (MOE) is striving to 
equip and expand the scientific research base by expanding the 
outlays for scientific research, nurturing excellent young 
researchers, rounding out research facilities, setting up 
scientific information systems, and promoting research 
cooperation with industry and international scientific exchange. 
The MOE is also actively tackling global-scale themes such as 
global environmental problems. 
  At present, in FY93, there are 84 MOE-related research 
laboratories (Table 1). The MOE's FY93 S&amp;T budget is 
&yen;1.0463 
trillion. The major items in that budget are described below.

<H5>  B. Expanding the Subsidies for Scientific Research Expenses </H5>
  The Subsidies for Scientific Research Expenses are research 
support funds for promoting Japan's science, the objective of 
which is to bring about the marked development of creative, 
pioneering scientific research in all fields from humanities and 
the social sciences to the natural sciences. These funds 
subsidize the basic research planned by university researchers 
and research groups that is regarded as especially important and 
conforms with scientific research trends. The funds are the main 
outlays for promoting scientific research at universities and 
other such organizations. 
  In the FY93 budget, &yen;73.6 billion, which is &yen;9.0 
billion more than the year before, are appropriated for the 
prioritized promotion of leading-edge research, the foundational 
expansion of scientific research, the encouragement of excellent 
research by young researchers, and so forth. 
  The main contents of those items that received increased 
funding are as follows. 
  1) Making "priority-area research" more replete in order 
to promote research in areas for which there is strong 
scientific and social demand: environmental, earth and space 
science (the environment, earth and space, energy control, 
etc.); materials science (properties of atomic nuclei, chemical 
substances, new materials, etc.); information and electronics 
science (information science and mathematics, electronic 
engineering, etc.); and the life sciences (bioscience, cancer, 
neurology, etc.). 
  \2) Making "General Research (A)," "General Research 
(B)," and "General Research (C)" more replete in order to expand 
creative, pioneering basic research and to promote humanities 
and social science research. 
  3) Making "Special Researcher Subsidies" and "Incentive 
Research (A)" more replete for special researchers nominated by 
the Japan Society for the Promotion of Science (JSPS) in order 
to nurture and secure young researchers. 
  4) Making "Test Research (A)" and "Test Research (B)" 
more replete in order to further facilitate test and applied 
research for which there is the possibility of those research 
results being shifted into practical applications. 
  5) Making "International Scientific Research" more 
replete in order to further facilitate international joint 
research. 
  6) Making "Expenses for Facilitating the Publication of 
Research Results" more replete in order to facilitate the 
publication of researchresults and the creation of databases. 
  7) Making "Expenses for Creative Basic Research" more 
replete in order to promote research based on new programs of 
science. 
<H5>  C. Promotion of Important Basic Research </H5>
<H5>  1. Astronomy Research </H5>
  Astronomy, one of the traditional fields of natural science, 
is an important field that helps to advance the understanding of 
space phenomena and contributes to the systemization of the 
natural laws of physics. Research in astronomy is carried out 
primarily by the National Institute of Astronomy, which was 
established in July 1988 as an inter-university research 
institute. 
  During FY93, the MOE will promote the construction of an 
eight-meter optical infrared telescope at the National 
Observatory, the objective of which is to look 15 billion light 
years into the far reaches of space to see how space looked at 
the time the Milky Way was born. 
  To further promote research on cosmic rays and elementary 
particles, at the Tokyo University Cosmic Ray Laboratory the MOE 
will promote the construction of a large water Cerenkov cosmic 
elementary particle observation device consisting of a 
50,000-ton water tank and 11,200 photomultiplier tubes 1,000 m 
underground. 
  For these efforts, &yen;4.038 billion are appropriated. 
<H5>  2. Accelerator Science </H5>
  Tristan Experimental Research (National Laboratory for 
High-Energy Physics) 
  The National Laboratory for High-Energy Physics uses the 
"Tristan" accelerator (diameter, 960 m; energy, 30 billion eV), 
which went into full-scale operation in May 1987, to carry out 
collision experiments with electrons and positrons that are 
accelerated to high energies. Then, by investigating the 
reactions that occur among elementary particles, experiments are 
conducted to explore the ultimate structure of matter and the 
relationships among the elementary forces of nature. In FY93, 
the MOE will continue to promote that experimental research. 
  For these efforts, &yen;13.023 billion are appropriated. 
<H5>  3. Space Science </H5>
  The Institute of Space and Astronautical Science (ISAS) will 
be involved in the production of the No. 16 scientific satellite 
(for engineering experiments, to be launched in FY95) and the 
No. 18 scientific satellite (for observational research of the 
atmosphere of Mars, to be launched in FY96), and the development 
of the No. 17 scientific satellite (for elucidation of the 
moon's internal structure, to be launched in FY97), and the 
Space Experiment and Observation Free Flyer (a multi-purpose, 
reusable unmanned spacelab for implementing astronomical 
observation, and physics and engineering experiments; to be 
launched in FY94). 
  In addition, in order to keep up with the developments in 
lunar and planetary surveys and scientific observation missions, 
the MOE will continue its development of a large rocket (M-V) 
for launching large scientific satellites. 
  For these efforts, &yen;20.646 billion are appropriated. 
<H5>  4. Fusion Research </H5>
  In order to promote research on helical-system-based nuclear 
fusion, which is expected to become a source of energy in the 
future, the MOE is proceeding with the production of a large 
helical device at the Fusion Science Research Institute. The MOE 
is also proceeding with fusion research at universities that is 
based on various other kinds of systems. 
  In addition to facilitating the production of the large 
helical device at the Fusion Science Research Institute (which 
is in the fourth year of a eight-year program), during FY93 the 
MOE will conduct fusion research using various kinds of methods. 
  For these efforts, &yen;12.819 billion are appropriated. 
<H5>  5. Ocean Science </H5>
  International Deep-Sea Excavation Program (ODP) 
  The goal of this international joint research program is to 
use the U.S. deep-sea excavation ship (Joydis Resolution 
[phonetic]) to dig up the ocean floor in various places around 
the world for the purpose of scientifically elucidating the 
long-term fluctuations in the global environment, the crustal 
structure of the ocean floor, etc. Japan's first-term projects 
will end in September 1993, then Japan will participate in the 
five-year second-term projects, which will begin in October 
1993. In addition to Japan, the U.S., UK, France, Germany, 
Canada, Russia and the European Science Foundation (12 
countries) are participating in this program (the Japanese 
organization involved is the Tokyo University's Ocean Research 
Institute). Japan has been participating in the program since 
the first-term projects, which started in October 1985. In the 
FY93 budget, an allotment of &yen;344 million (about $2.82 
million) are appropriated for Japan's continued participation. 
(As for operating expenses, see Section K-1-(b)-5.) 
<H5>  6. Prediction of Earthquakes and Volcanic Eruptions </H5>
  Observational research for predicting earthquakes and 
volcanic eruptions in Japan is comprehensively and 
programmatically promoted by national universities, the 
Meteorological Agency, the Geographical Survey Institute, and 
other concerned organizations in accordance with the Earthquake 
Prediction and Volcanic Eruption Prediction Programs that the 
Geodetic Council (chairman: Satoshi Asada, Tokai University 
professor) proposed to the Education Minister and other 
concerned ministers. 
  Further repletion of observational research systems and the 
promotion of basic research for elucidating earthquakes and 
volcanic activity are pointed out in these prediction programs, 
signifying that universities should play a greater role. 
Promotion of research in this field is desired; there is not 
just scientific demand for it, but also strong social demand 
from the perspective of disaster prevention. 
  (1) Earthquake Prediction 
  Observational research for earthquake prediction is now 
promoted in accordance with the Sixth Earthquake Prediction 
Program (a five-year program from 1989 to 1993). During FY93, 
the fifth year for the program, &yen;2.027 billion are 
appropriated for rounding out earthquake prediction 
observational research at universities and other such 
organizations. 
  The main contents of that are: 
  1) Rounding out the observational research systems; 
Equipping 
the regional earthquake and volcano observation centers (Nagoya 
Univ., Physics Dept.) 
  2) Rounding out the Nagoya and Kyushu regional 
micro-earthquake observational systems 
  3) Rounding out the systems for basic research on inland 
earthquake prediction and earthquake observational research in 
the Tokyo area; Rounding out the observational facilities and 
equipment; Rounding out observational research enterprises, etc. 
  4) Rounding out other observational research enterprises 
(comprehensive observational research in south Kanto and Tokai 
regions) 
  (2) Volcanic Eruption Prediction 
  Observational research for predicting volcanic eruptions is 
now promoted in accordance with the Fourth Volcanic Eruption 
Prediction Program (a five-year program from 1989 to 1993). 
During FY93, the fifth year for the program, &yen;396 million 
are appropriated for rounding out volcanic eruption prediction 
observational research at universities and other such 
organizations. 
  The main contents of that are: 
  1) Rounding out the observational research systems; 
Equipping 
the regional earthquake and volcano observation centers (Nagoya 
Univ., Physics Dept.) 
  2) Augmenting observations of the active volcanos where 
observational research should be carried out on a priority 
basis; (Augmenting observations of Mount Kusatsu Shirane, Izu 
Oshima, Unzendake, Mount Aso, Sakurajima, etc.) 
  3) Comprehensive, concentrated observation of specific 
volcanoes (Mount Aritama, Mount Fuji) 
<H5>  7. Antarctic Observation Project </H5>
  The Antarctic Observation Project started in 1957. Now, the 
39-member 34th winter team is conducting winter-long 
observations. 
  During FY93, the 56-member 35th observation team will be 
sent, and three people will be dispatched to other countries' 
base camps. 
  In addition to routine observations of climate, the oceans, 
etc., the 35th observation will involve continuing priority 
research observations based on yearly projects such as the "Ice 
Sheet Dome Deep-Layer Excavation Observations" (the third year 
of a five-year project). 
  The rebuilding of the Showa base camp structures will 
continue (the third year of an eight-year project), and, from 
the perspective of protecting the Antarctic environment, the MOE 
will equip and maintain facilities for waste processing.

<H5>  8. Promotion of the "Ten-Year Anti-Cancer Strategy" </H5>
  The aims of the "Ten-Year Anti-Cancer Strategy" (decided 
upon 
in a ministerial conference on cancer countermeasures, 7 June 
1983) are to elucidate the true nature of cancer in a 10-year 
effort and to reflect those results in the prevention, 
diagnosis, and treatment of cancer. In addition to promoting 
cancer research as it has all along, the MOE in cooperation with 
concerned ministries and agencies will develop policies based on 
the strategy and will work toward achieving the objectives of 
the strategy. 
  For FY93, the 10th year of the program, a total of 
&yen;3.73100 billion are appropriated for promoting cancer 
research as a priority theme, for maintenance of the cancer 
research system in national universities, and so forth (Table 
3). Incidentally, the overall government budget for this 
program, i.e., including the expenses of the MHW and STA, is 
&yen;17.99100 billion.

<H5>  9. Promotion of Research Based on New Program Formats </H5>
  There are some remarkable developments in the state of 
affairs surrounding scientific research: the increasing social 
demand for further promotion of scientific research resulting 
from rapid socioeconomic changes, developments, and the trend 
toward attaching importance to science and technology in recent 
years; the fact that scientific research is required to play a 
pioneering role in connection with research for creating new 
technology that contributes to humankind; and the heightening 
demand for international contributions through scientific 
exchange. In order to cope appropriately with such recent trends 
and demands that surround scientific research, we must find ways 
to actively promote scientific research by dynamically and 
flexibly deciding which fields of research should be promoted in 
Japan, by investing researchers and research outlays in a 
prioritized fashion, by promoting group research, and by 
maintaining joint research systems. (A proposal made by the 
Science Council in July 1989.) 
  Accordingly, the MOE listens to the opinions of the Science 
Council and determines which research fields should be 
concretely promoted from among the types of research that will 
give rise to new, revolutionary areas of study. By means of 
formats that serve to promote group research and maintain joint 
research systems (New Program Formats), the MOE strives to 
actively promote scientific research. 
  During FY93, the MOE will promote 10 research efforts, seven 
of which are continued research efforts and three of which are 
new undertakings that will begin in FY93. 
  (Research themes continued over from FY90) 
  1) Elucidation of the dynamic mechanisms in living organisms 
(Research leader: Setsuro Ebashi, head of the Okazaki National 
Research Institutes) 
  2) Research on global environmental changes centering on the 
Asia, Pacific region (Research leader: Saburo Tamura, professor 
emeritus of Tokyo University) 
  (Research themes continued over from FY91) 
  3) Research on artificially controlled functional molecular

<H5>  D. Maintenance, Repletion of Research Facilities </H5>
  As scientific research becomes more advanced, the research 
facilities and equipment needed for that become larger and more 
expensive along with their increased performance. 
  In this regard, and as pointed out in an emergency proposal 
by the SCJ in a July 1992 report, the research facilities of 
national universities are rapidly deteriorating and becoming 
obsolete, and the maintenance and repletion of those facilities 
is an urgent issue. 
  Based on such proposals, research facilities must be 
maintained and better equipped, and the research environment 
must be made more sophisticated in order to promote scientific 
research from now on. 
  For that purpose a total of &yen;24.420 billion are 
appropriated in FY93. Those funds will be used 1) to maintain 
and equip on a priority basis the facilities for basic research 
needed for promoting more sophistication in the research 
environment of those research organizations that have shown 
excellent research results and are expected to make dramatic 
advances in the future, but cannot handle very advanced 
research; and 2) to make replete the large-scale, 
high-performance research facilities needed for the type of 
research that will uncover new research fields and will lead to 
further advances.

<H5>  3. Japan Academy </H5>
  As an organization for providing special treatment to 
eminent 
scientists, the Japan Academy carries out the necessary tasks 
for contributing to the advancement of science. 
  During FY93, the Japan Academy will continue its awards 
program, hold open regional lectures, and promote scientific 
exchange through its alliance with academies of other countries 
and international academies. 
  As expenses needed for these activities, &yen;526 million 
are 
appropriated (excluding personnel expenses). 
<H5>  F. Promotion of Research Cooperation with Industry </H5>
  Today there are various expectations and demands from all 
aspects of society toward scientific research in universities. 
While educational research has been the mission of universities 
all along, coping with the demands of society as well as 
possible under that identity while also cooperating with 
industry is significant from the standpoint of universities' 
contribution to society. It is also important in that scientific 
research at universities gains a rewarding stimulus. 
  Accordingly, the MOE actively promotes policies on research 
cooperation between universities and industry. 
<H5>  1. Setting Up Joint Research Centers </H5>
  In FY87 the MOE started equipping and maintaining joint 
research centers as places for promoting joint research with the 
private sector, commissioned research, and national 
universities' research collaboration with industry. During FY93, 
the ministry will set up joint research centers in the following 
five universities: 


    -  Iwate University--regional joint research center 
  -  Akita 
University--regional joint research center 
  -  Shinshu 
University--regional joint research center 
  -  Tottori 
University--regional joint research center 
  -  Oita 
University--regional joint research center 

<H3>    2. Repletion of System of Joint Research with the Private 
Sector </H3>
  &yen;5.033 billion are appropriated for further repletion of 
the system of joint research with the private sector, in which 
the faculty members of national universities collaborate on an 
equal basis with researchers from private firms in research on 
common themes. This funding is &yen;85 million more than that of 
the year before. 
<H5>  3. Acceptance of Commissioned Research </H5>
  &yen;9.647 billion are appropriated for facilitating 
commissioned research, in which the faculty members of national 
universities are commissioned to do research, as public service, 
by industry or other outside organizations. This funding is 
&yen;198 million more than that of the year before. 
<H5>  4. Acceptance of Commissioned Researchers, etc. </H5>
  &yen;456 million are appropriated for expanding the 
commissioned researcher system, which provides opportunities for 
the acceptance of working engineers and researchers who receive 
research guidance at the graduate level. This funding is &yen;40 
million more than that of the year before. (The number of people 
accepted (1,529) is 50 more than that of the year before.) 
<H5>  5. Acceptance of Scholarship Contributions </H5>
  In FY93 &yen;50.162 billion are appropriated for 
facilitating 
the acceptance of scholarship contributions from private firms 
and other outside organizations; the contributions should be 
applied to expenditures for scientific research or expenses 
aimed at educational research in national universities. This 
funding is &yen;1.978 billion more than that of the year before. 
<H3>  6. Promotion of Test and Applied Research by Means of 
Subsidies for Scientific Research Expenses "Test Research" </H3>
  The purpose of this "test research" is to promote test and 
applied research for which there is the possibility of those 
research results being shifted into practical applications. The 
MOE praises test research that is based on the participation of 
researchers from the research departments of private firms, and 
appropriated &yen;6.560 billion as subsidies for that. This is 
an increase of &yen;860 million over the previous year. 
<H3>  7. Promotion of JSPS "Social Cooperation Scientific 
Enterprises" </H3>
  Based on the deliberations of the Science Council, the JSPS 
has launched general research liaison meetings since cooperative 
university-industry efforts first developed in 1982. The purpose 
of these meetings, which are made up of leaders and 
professionals involved in the research activities of industry 
and universities, is to comprehensively investigate, with a 
long-term outlook, the problems of university-industry 
cooperation. Now, special committees on "human genome" and 
"atomic cluster" R&amp;D have been organized from those meetings, 
and &yen;16 million are appropriated for the promotion of those 
enterprises in FY93. 
<H5>  G. Support for Private Scientific Research Organizations </H5>
  Private scientific research organizations have an important 
mission in promoting Japan's science, which is reflected in the 
"Law on Support of Private Scientific Research Organizations" 
(1951 No. 227). Based on that law, the MOE appropriated &yen;123 
million in FY93 to provide partial support for the expenses 
needed to maintain and operate the corporations whose purpose is 
scientific research that were established in accordance with the 
provisions of Article 34 of the Civil Code. In that, &yen;16 
million are appropriated as outlays needed for private 
scientific research organizations in the form of ODA enterprises 
to carry out scientific exchange and cooperation based on the 
requests of research organizations of developing countries. 
<H5>  H. Maintenance, Repletion of Scientific Information and Data </H5>
<H5>  1. Maintenance, Repletion of Scientific Information Systems </H5>
  Quickly and accurately providing the scientific information 
needed by university researchers, together with maintaining 
comprehensive nationwide scientific information systems for 
disseminating research results within and outside of Japan, is 
becoming an urgent necessity as the basis for bringing forth 
excellent, creative and pioneering scientific research. 
  To that end the MOE is now working to expand the 
organization 
and functions of the NACSIS, which was established in 1987, and 
is actively equipping a scientific information system that will 
link national and private universities throughout Japan to the 
center. 
  During FY93 the MOE will promote the maintenance of a 
comprehensive, nationwide fluid system for scientific 
information by introducing computers into university libraries; 
expanding large computer centers, general information processing 
centers, etc.; and facilitating the creation of databases. 
  (a) Maintenance of the NACSIS 
  The MOE will work to expand the organization and functions 
of 
NACSIS, which will be the central organ of the scientific 
information system. 
  In FY93 &yen;2.579 billion are appropriated as the outlays 
needed for implementing the following activities. 
  1) Coordinating the planning and linkage of the 
scientific information system 
  2) Comprehensive R&amp;D in connection with scientific 
information 
  3) Building and operating a scientific information network 
  4) Collecting and cataloging primary information and 
supplying information on the whereabouts of that information; 
Coping with the systematic collection of primary information 
from university libraries, etc. (scientific books, periodicals, 
etc.) by creating catalogs and databases containing information 
on the locations of those books, periodicals, etc., and a quick, 
accurate service to provide that information. Providing an 
electronic inter-library lending (ILL) system. 
  5) Providing an information retrieval service; A quick, 
accurate service to provide secondary information (numerical, 
image, and other such fact data; bibliographies; abstracts of 
documents; etc.) 
  6) Facilitating database creation 
  7) Education, training, etc. 
  (b) Maintenance, Repletion of Component Organizations in the 
Scientific Information System 
  For maintenance and repletion of the basic conditions for 
the 
scientific information system, the MOE took the measures 
described below in connection with the FY93 expenses for 
university libraries, database creation, and the information 
processing facilities that will make up the scientific 
information system. 



  1) Establishment, Maintenance of Large Computer Centers 
and Other Information Processing Facilities 
  The large computer centers that are nationwide joint-use 
facilities and the general information processing centers of 
joint educational research facilities within universities 
perform scientific and technical calculations and data 
processing for research, education, etc., in universities, and 
they use databases to provide scientific information services. 
  Already seven large computer centers, 15 general information 
processing centers, and 49 information processing centers have 
been set up. During FY93, the Tohoku University Computing 
Center's supercomputer will be updated, and new general 
information processing centers will be set up at the Yokohama 
National University and Ehime University; and new information 
processing centers will be established at the Joetsu University 
of Education and at the Kyoto University of Education. 
  2) Introduction, etc., of Special-Purpose Library 
Computers 
  Since 1980 the MOE has been promoting programs to introduce 
special-purpose computers into libraries on the premise that 
university libraries would be networked together. This program 
is an attempt to construct a scientific information system in 
which mid-sized special-purpose computers are placed in large 
libraries and small special-purpose computers are set up in 
small libraries. Computers have already been introduced at 13 
large libraries and 73 small libraries. During FY93, 
special-purpose computers will be introduced at seven small 
libraries (Otaru University of Commerce, Kitami Institute of 
Technology, Hiromae University, Iwate University, Saitama 
University, Tokyo University of Fisheries, and Kochi University). 
  3) Maintenance, Repletion of Foreign Magazine Centers 
(Accumulation, Provision of Primary Information) 
  From the viewpoint of common ownership of scientific 
information resources, since FY77 the MOE has designated certain 
university libraries as foreign magazine centers for four 
fields: medicine and biology (the libraries of Osaka, Tohoku, 
and Kyushu Universities), physics and engineering (the libraries 
of Tokyo Institute of Technology and Kyoto University), 
agriculture (the libraries of Tokyo and Kagoshima Universities), 
and humanities and social science (the libraries of Hitotsubashi 
and Kobe Universities). These centers share the work of 
systematically collecting materials, centering on foreign 
magazines that are scarce in Japan, and they provide information 
services to researchers throughout Japan that include document 
copy services. 
  By FY92 the foreign magazine centers had accumulated about 
19,000 titles of foreign scientific magazines in the four 
fields; over 500,000 copies per year are made. 
  Furthermore, in order to make research and educational 
materials more replete, &yen;2.4111 billion (FY92, &yen;2.32783 
billion) are appropriated in FY93 for purchasing books for 
students, special books, foreign magazines, and electronic 
information materials. Along with that, to facilitate the 
modernization of the libraries by means of mechanization, 
&yen;35.271 million are appropriated as expenses for book 
detection systems (equipment to prevent unauthorized borrowing 
of books), CD-ROM systems and audio-visual equipment systems; 
&yen;2.413202 billion (FY92, &yen;2.338834 billion) are 
appropriated as expenses needed for improving library services, 
e.g., basic operating expenses and keeping the library open at 
night. 
  4) Forming Databases 
  In order to disseminate university researchers' research 
results within and outside of Japan, it is very important to 
organize vast amounts of information and make it available for 
use by forming databases in which the information is accumulated 
on computer-processable magnetic media. 
  In FY93, &yen;466.5 million (mentioned twice) are 
appropriated as expenses for the creation or purchase of 
databases at NACSIS. In addition, &yen;121.0 million are 
appropriated as expenses for creating databases in universities, 
and &yen;35.30 million for purchasing the international 
databases that are needed for providing information retrieval 
services to researchers. 
  5) Maintenance of Campus Information Networks (LANs) 
  Since FY87 the MOE has been programmatically outfitting and 
maintaining campus information networks (campus LANs). This 
involves networking various kinds of computers together with 
optical fibers and other means so that numerical and graphical 
scientific information from laboratories can be utilized. 
  In FY93 &yen;99.83 million are appropriated for setting up a 
LAN at Kyushu University. 
  6) Maintenance, Repletion of Document Materials Centers 
  The MOE maintains document materials centers and data 
materials centers so that it can centrally maintain data and 
primary materials for special fields and offer it for joint use 
throughout Japan, and create databases in those fields. The MOE 
found ways to make the operations of the National Cultural 
Research Materials Hall, and the document materials centers more 
replete in FY93. 
<H5>  2. Maintenance, Repletion of Scientific Materials </H5>
  (a) Maintenance of Animal Experiment Facilities 
  To improve the accuracy of animal experiments and to 
facilitate more efficient breeding control, the MOE maintains 
modern animal experiment facilities. In FY93 the MOE will set up 
new animal experiment facilities at the University of the 
Ryukyus, and will equip the animal experiment facilities at 
Nagoya University and the Medical College of Oita. As for those 
expenses, &yen;224.199 million (FY92, &yen;224.199 million) are 
appropriated for purchasing animals and feed, and &yen;131.110 
million (FY92, &yen;92.536 million) for facilities and 
equipment. The MOE also increased the outlays needed for 
operating the facilities. 
  (b) Strain Preservation Enterprises 
  The MOE runs enterprises to preserve the strains of animals, 
plants, microorganisms, and other living organisms with 
characteristics that are useful in scientific research. In FY93 
the necessary expenses for preserving strains are appropriated. 
A total of 84 species are preserved at national universities: 30 
animal species, 27 plant species, 20 microorganism species, and 
seven varieties of cell stock. 
  (c) Maintenance of Scientific Specimens 
  Establishing a system for collecting, storing, and utilizing 
the materials used for education and research in various fields 
is essential in the promotion of scientific research. For that 
reason a specimen materials hall was set up in 1965 for storing 
and employing education and research materials for special 
fields. In FY93 the MOE appropriated the expenses needed to 
maintain those specimens at the Tokyo University General 
Research Materials Hall and at the textile museum affiliated 
with the Tokyo University of Agriculture and Technology 
Engineering Department. 
  (d) Maintenance of Isotope Research Facilities 
  Because of the need for special care in the handling of 
radioactive isotopes based on the "Law on Preventing Radiation 
Hazards due to Radioactive Isotopes," the MOE maintains isotope 
research facilities at which ample consideration is given to 
radiation safety management. In FY93, the MOE will establish the 
new Isotope Center at Niigata University, and will post 
management personnel at the Shizuoka University isotope research 
facilities. In addition to appropriating &yen;279.04 million 
(FY92, &yen;376.474 million) for facilities and equipment to 
prevent radiation hazards, the MOE also appropriated the funds 
needed for operating those facilities.

<H5>  I. Repletion, Strengthening of the JSPS </H5>
  The JSPS, whose purpose is to contribute to the advancement 
of science, carries out a wide variety of projects that relate 
to the promotion of science: supporting scientific research, 
assisting researchers, facilitating international cooperation in 
science, etc. 
  In FY93 &yen;8.98940 billion (in FY92, &yen;7.65736 
billion), 
which is an increase of 17&percnt; over the previous year, are 
appropriated for the following efforts. 
  1) Broadly expanding the number of special researchers 
employed and improving research incentive funds to help foster 
excellent young researchers in accordance with the Science 
Council's report entitled "Measures for Comprehensively 
Promoting Scientific Research with Prospects for the 21st 
Century" (July 1992). 
  2) Repletion of the "Overseas Special Researcher System," 
which sends prominent young researchers to scientific research 
organizations overseas for long-term stays for the purposes of 
nurturing and securing competent researchers with an 
international point of view to support the future of Japan's 
science. 
  3) Repletion of the "Foreigner Special Researcher 
System," the purposes of which are to have Japanese universities 
accept young post-doctorate researchers from other countries and 
employ them in research under the appropriate leaders, to 
contribute to the cultivation of researchers in foreign 
countries, to apply an academic stimulus to the young 
researchers of Japan, and to contribute to the advance of 
scientific research. 
  4) Repletion of commissioned Japanese-language training 
enterprises for foreign researchers so that foreign researchers 
who stay long-term at Japanese universities can carry out their 
research activities adequately. 
  5) Starting Japanese-German scientific cooperation 
efforts by promoting front-line research and creative concepts 
between Japan and Germany. 
  6) Expansion of support for people who want to get 
doctorate degrees, which is a policy for promoting scientific 
exchange with ASEAN countries, and holding the Asia Science 
Seminars again, which help to nurture researchers and improve 
the level of research in Asia. 
<H5>  J. Promotion of Global Environmental Research </H5>
  Today there are serious concerns about global-scale 
environmental problems such as global warming, ozone layer 
depletion, and acid rain. Finding solutions to those problems is 
an urgent and important issue for the future survival and 
prosperity of humankind. 
  In order to solve these global environmental problems, the 
further accumulation of scientific knowledge about the 
mechanisms that give rise to global-scale environmental changes 
in the atmosphere, oceans, and ecosystems is extremely important. 
  There are also strong calls for tackling these problems in 
an 
internationally cooperative manner. 
  With that kind of awareness, the MOE is actively endeavoring 
towards finding solutions to global environmental problems 
through maintenance and repletion of research systems in 
universities and through the promotion of joint international 
research efforts. (Table 5)

<H5>  K. Promotion of International Cooperative Projects </H5>
<H5>  1. International Joint Research Projects </H5>
  The MOE promotes binational and multinational joint research 
centering on "fields that require large-scale experimental 
facilities" and "fields that require global-scale joint 
observations." 
  (a) New Joint Research Starting in FY93 
  1) Japan-China High-Energy Cosmic Ray Joint Research 
Program; Involves setting up a cosmic ray observation device in 
Yanpachin [phonetic] (altitude, 4300 m) in the Tibet autonomous 
region, and conducting research on the composition and source of 
generation of cosmic rays. 
  2) Ocean Observation International Joint Research Program 
(GOOS); Involves elucidating the changes in the marine 
environment, and conducting the basic research needed for 
construction of a comprehensive observation system for 
prediction and conservation. 
  In FY93 &yen;121.987 million are appropriated as the 
necessary expenses for the two new joint projects. 
  (b) Continued Joint Research 
  1) International Joint Particle Physics Experimental 
Projects in European nuclear research institutes (10-10) (Tokyo 
University, Physics Dept.) &yen;70.360 million 
  2) Solar-Terrestrial Energy International Joint Research 
Program (STEP) (5-3) &yen;192.362 million

(IDNDR) (3-3) (Kyoto University, Disaster Prevention Research 
Institute) &yen;50.697 million 
  10) International Geosphere-Biosphere Project (5-2) 
&yen;108.931 million 
  (c) Japan-U.S. S&amp;T Cooperation Projects 
  1) Energy Fields 
  Since FY79 the MOE has been promoting joint research with 
the 
U.S. based on the Japan-U.S. Energy Accord that was signed in 
May 1979. 
  The projects in which the MOE is involved are in three 
fields: nuclear fusion, solar energy conversion 
(photosynthesis), and high-energy physics. &yen;1.868892 billion 
are appropriated as expenses needed for exchanging researchers 
in these joint research efforts, holding seminars, joint 
experiments, etc. 
  2) Non-Energy Fields 
  Since FY81 the MOE has been promoting joint research with 
the 
U.S. based on the Japan-U.S. S&amp;T Cooperation Accord that was 
signed in May 1980. 
  The projects in which the MOE is involved are in four 
fields: 
space science, neutron scattering, experimental animal science, 
and recombinant DNA. &yen;65.558 million are appropriated as 
expenses needed for exchanging researchers in these joint 
research efforts, holding seminars, joint experiments, etc. 
  Incidentally, the projects mentioned above are being 
continued as projects under the new Japan-U.S. S&amp;T 
Cooperation 
Accord that was signed in June 1988. 
<H5>  2. Promotion of UNESCO Projects </H5>
  (a) Global Environmental Science (Asia, Pacific region) 
Projects 
  The subcommittee consisting of the Japan UNESCO domestic 
committee members and survey members and personnel from 
concerned ministries and agencies (set up in July 1976) is the 
organization for dealing with the intergovernmental joint survey 
projects that UNESCO implements in connection with global 
environmental science (Intergovernmental Oceanography Committee 
(IOC), Man and Biosphere project (MAB), International Hydrology 
Project (IHP), and the General Information Project (GIP)). This 
subcommittee plans research studies, provides data, sends 
representatives to intergovernmental conferences, and so forth. 
In FY93 &yen;4.441 million are appropriated for those expenses. 
  In addition, the MOE has been contributing trust funds to 
UNESCO since FY81 in order to take part in the "Western Pacific 
Joint Survey" (WESTPAC), which is implemented as a part of the 
IOC enterprise. Continued again in FY93, the funds equivalent to 
$30,000 are appropriated. 
  Furthermore, funds equivalent to $80,000 are appropriated 
again in FY93 as trust funds for UNESCO IHP students. These 
donations started in FY92. 
  Incidentally, in FY93, trust funds equivalent to $50,000 are 
appropriated for joint global environmental research efforts in 
the Asia-Pacific Region, which center on cooperation in the MAB 
project. 
  (b) Cooperative Basic Science Efforts in Southeast Asia 
  UNESCO creates networks among the universities and research 
institutes of Southeast Asian countries in the two fields of 
microbiology and the chemistry of natural products for the 
purpose of promoting basic science in Southeast Asia. Through 
these networks, UNESCO carries out exchange of young 
researchers, holds seminars and training courses, publishes 
newsletters, and so forth. In order to collaborate in these 
efforts, Japan has been contributing $100,000 every year as 
UNESCO trust funds since FY77 ($50,000 per year in FY75 and 
FY76). In FY93, funds equivalent to $100,000 are appropriated. 
<H5>  3. International Research Conferences </H5>
  (a) Sending Researchers to International Research 
Conferences 
  To send Japan's prominent researchers to scientific 
international research meetings that are held overseas, during 
FY93 &yen;215.471 million are appropriated (for 336 people) in 
the National Schools Special Account and &yen;11.854 million 
(for 17 people) in the General Account. 
  (b) Expenses for Holding International Symposia 
  To activate international exchange and raise the level of 
research in universities, &yen;191.874 million are appropriated 
in FY93 as expenses for inviting the front-line researchers of 
the world to national universities and for holding international 
symposia. 
  (c) International Conferences Held in Japan 
  Based on a Cabinet meeting understanding, &yen;43.527 
million 
in outlays are appropriated for the faculties of national 
universities to participate in conferences that the SCJ will 
hold in Japan (15th International Botanical Science Conference, 
7th Pacific Scientists' Mid-Term Conference, 24th International 
Meeting of the Radio-Wave Science Federation, 6th International 
Meteorology and Atmospheric Physics Conference, and the 4th 
International Hydrology Conference) and for the famous 
researchers from foreign countries who participate in these 
conferences to give scientific lectures at national universities.
