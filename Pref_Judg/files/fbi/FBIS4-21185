  [Text] Police have learned how the illegal numbers lottery 
money is laundered. Another illegal lottery betting place was 
busted by police in Rio de Janeiro today. Police believe some 
betting places are changing their location as a result of the 
investigations. Police this morning confiscated this material as 
it was taken from the Copacabana district to another southern 
Rio de Janeiro district. 
  Federal Police learned how the illegal lottery money 
laundering scheme works. It is done through the Acaray Casino in 
Ciudad del Este, Paraguay. One of the casino owners is illegal 
lottery banker Waldomiro Garcia, aka Miro, who uses the casino 
to justify a good portion of the illegal lottery money that is 
registered as profits from the casino. 
  The illegal lottery bankers also use the Uruguayan financial 
market to launder the money produced by other illegal 
businesses. This money circulates through Montevideo banks as if 
it were money from Uruguayan companies that make large 
investments in Punta del Este's real estate market. These are 
fictitious businesses that always render fantastic profits. 
  The money leaves Rio de Janeiro, goes to Paraguay, and then 
to Uruguay. From there, already converted into clean money, it 
is sent to fiscal paradises like Bahamas, Cayman, and Virgin 
Islands. In the end, the money circulates normally in the 
international financial market. 
  The illegal lottery bankers charge from 10 to 15 percent to 
facilitate the laundering of money both in Uruguay and Paraguay. 
After the money is laundered abroad through several financial 
method, the money returns to Brazil as foreign investments. It 
is as if I lend my money to myself through a foreign company, 
apply it in the Brazilian financial market, then repay the money 
to myself with interest, and then once again send it all abroad.
