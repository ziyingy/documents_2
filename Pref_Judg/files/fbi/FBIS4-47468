  [Abstract] Fabric-type contact devices are a new type of 
device capable of operating over a wide range of gas loads in 
the auto model valve-capillary mode. Hydrodynamic 
characteristics and contact phase surface formation mechanism 
were studied in a previous work, and their high efficiency as 
compared with traditionally used mass transfer columns in 
contact devices of the bubble type has been demonstrated. In the 
present work the operating efficiency of fabric-type contact 
devices was evaluated in relation to basic hydrodynamic process 
parameters of the desorption of carbon dioxide from water with 
air. A mass transfer mechanism is proposed which is based on the 
existence and mutual effects of two types of contact surface 
phases having different restoration mechanisms. The mechanisms 
and formulas were confirmed experimentally. Figures 3;
