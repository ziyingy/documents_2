  [Text] The Party of Russian Unity and Concord (PRUC) [PRES] 
must proclaim itself as a national conservative party, said its 
chairman, Sergey Shakhray, the Minister for Ethnic and Regional 
Policies. In Moscow on Saturday he addressed spokesmen for the 
party's regional organizations. 
  According to Shakhray, the government of Viktor Chernomyrdin 
has to choose between two possibilities: "One is to lean on the 
Communist and Agrarian factions in the State Duma, and the other 
to cut off their unacceptable proposals leading to 
hyperinflation together with the ultra-radical proposals of 
Russian Choice and lean on the centrist bloc which comprises 110 
to 130 State Duma members, including those from the PRUC. [no

only in this way," Shakhray said. 
  According to him, President Boris Yeltsin and Prime Minister 
Viktor Chernomyrdin are "the stablest figures" in Russian 
politics today. 
  According to Shakhray, he is not informed of how "the 
president's party", whose prompt emergence was predicted by the 
leader of the president's office, Sergey Filatov, recently, will 
be formed. "There is only one way to form such a party -- to add 
party functions to executive authorities and prop them up with 
political mechanism when laws, decrees and instructions fail to 
be observed," he said. 
  Shakhray said he is against his party's joining "the 
president's", "the government's" or any other party. He wants 
it to preserve its political and organizational independence. 
He categorically denied the possibility of cooperating with 
Vladimir Zhirinovskiy in the State Duma "for political, medical, 
psychological and other reasons".
