  [Text] London, 10 May (EFE) -- The councilmen of the 
Malvinas Government have asked Senator Eduardo Menem, Argentine 
President Carlos Menem's brother, to get Argentina to renounce 
its sovereignty claim over the South Atlantic islands and accept 
the islanders' "right to exist as Argentina's neighbor." 
  The councilmen wrote to John Ward, the British 
representative 
to the Inter-Parliamentary Union (IPU) on 9 May. The letter 
appeared in the local press on 10 May. In their letter, the 
councilmen disagree with Eduardo Menem's position at the IPU 
meeting in Paris from 21 through 25 March. 
  They criticize Eduardo Menem for having ignored, at this 
meeting, "the rights and position of the people who live on the 
lands being claimed" -- alluding to the Malvinas Islands. 
  "We urge Senator Eduardo Menem to abandon the expansionistic 
and chauvinistic rhetoric that previous Argentine 
administrations have felt compelled to instill in the 
educational system and in everyday life; we also urge him to 
renounce his claim over our fatherland and to accept our right 
to exist as his neighbors," the letter states. 
  The islanders reaffirm that they are not "threatening 
Argentina," and ask to be allowed to "decide our future and live 
without worries of foreign threats against the land on which our 
ancestors settled." 
  The Malvinas councilmen reiterate the islanders' position 
that while Argentina claims sovereignty over the Malvinas 
Islands, Argentine citizens will not be allowed to set foot on 
the islands. 
  The councilmen indicate that the islanders are prepared to 
consider exploiting oil jointly with Argentina, provided this 
rapprochement will not be used to apply political pressure.
