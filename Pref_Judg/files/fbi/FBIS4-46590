"KOMSOMOLETS" Submarine Sinking Site 
  In compliance with an RF Presidential Order and a decree 
issued by the government of the Russian Federation, the Russian 
MChS [Emergencies Ministry] is to provide supervision for the 
period 15 May to 15 August 1994 in the planning of an expedition 
to the site of the 1989 accidental sinking in the Norwegian Sea 
of the "KOMSOMOLETS" nuclear submarine, which has aboard a 
nuclear reactor and two torpedoes armed with nuclear warheads. 
  The greatest potential danger relative to radiation in the 
ecological situation in the Norwegian Sea is posed by the two 
torpedoes each carrying 3,200 grams of plutonium 239. The actual 
danger is associated with the possibility that corrosion may 
lead to the release of plutonium into the sea. The most 
pessimistic forecast specialists can make is the possibility of 
such an occurrence in the end of 1995-1996. 
  The above being the case, the expedition's purpose consists 
of sealing the submarine's forward section, monitoring the 
environment for radiation leakage, and maintaining checks on the 
technical condition of the craft. 
  The cost of the abovementioned operations will amount to 
4.625 billion rubles and 4.1 million dollars. According to the 
MChS leadership, the government of the Russian Federation is to 
provide all the funding. 
  Technical project development is to be accomplished under a 
contractual arrangement with the TsKB [Central Design Bureau] 
Rubin, with the participation of a number of scientific research 
institutions of the RAN [Russian Academy of Sciences], the MO 
[Ministry of Defense], and industrial organizations. 
  Expedition operations will involve the use of the research 
vessel "Academician Mot. Keldysh," which will be equipped with 
the Mir-1 and Mir-2 apparatus, and a ship belonging to the 
Ministry of Defense's GUNiO [Main Directorate for Navigation and 
Oceanography], which will transport equipment and expedition 
personnel from Murmansk to the site of operations. 
  Scientific and technical aspects of the work will be handled 
by the Main Administration for Operations in Seas and Water 
Bodies, Russian Emergencies Ministry, with the participation of 
specialists from a Ministry of Defense TsNII [Central Scientific 
Research Institute] and from 40 Ministry of Defense GNIIs [state 
scientific research institutes] on a contractual basis.
