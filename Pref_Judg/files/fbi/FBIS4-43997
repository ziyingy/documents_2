<F P=106> [Interview with Central Bank Council member Reimut </F>
Jochimsen, by Lorenz Wolf-Doettinchem; place and date not given: 
"`Blurred and Elastic'"] 
  [Text] [Wolf-Doettinchem] Mr. Jochimsen, the money supply 
is getting away from the Bundesbank. Can the German concept 
still serve as a model for European currency? 
  [Jochimsen] Double-digit growth rates are very irritating, I 
admit. I was never a money-supply manipulator, yet the fact that 
there is a long-term relationship among the money supply, 
production potential, and inflation has not, I believe, been 
disproved. 
  [Wolf-Doettinchem] Your Central Bank colleague Hans-Juergen 
Koebnick considers German monetary policy to be without 
direction. 
  [Jochimsen] I consider the problem to be rather that the 
rule 
"too much money equals too much inflation" has been presented to 
the public in too simplistic a manner. It currently does not 
apply in any event--otherwise we would have had to raise 
interest rates as early as February. 
  [Wolf-Doettinchem] Does not the Bundesbank's credibility 
suffer when it wants to stick to its concept but does not act 
accordingly in its practices? 
  [Jochimsen] We find ourselves in somewhat of a fix but there 
are no alternatives. I shudder at the thought of manipulating 
economic magnitudes such as price levels or the nominal national 
product. The instruments to do so are lacking. 
  [Wolf-Doettinchem] Should Europe then also put its faith in 
controlling the money supply? 
  [Jochimsen] Yes, the European Monetary Institute should do 
all the preliminary work for that, but without turning itself 
into a quasi-central bank in the process. 
  [Wolf-Doettinchem] France always brings its pat solution for 
European monetary policy--a rapid monetary union--into play. 
  [Jochimsen] I can only warn against acting along the lines 
of 
"Courage! Let us show the markets how it is done." A precipitous 
monetary union would be an experiment with completely uncertain 
results. 
  [Wolf-Doettinchem] A common currency without a common state. 
Is that at all possible? 
  [Jochimsen] I have the greatest doubts on that score. It is 
one thing to create a monetary union; it is a different issue as 
to whether it will last. A glace at the history books will show 
that most monetary unions have failed. 
  [Wolf-Doettinchem] Is this the fate in store for Europe as 
well? 
  [Jochimsen] The Maastricht Treaty is a makeshift 
construction. The necessary political safeguards for a monetary 
union--particularly in regard to economic and fiscal policy--are 
inadequate. The danger is real that a common currency will not 
result in a community of stability but in disintegration. 
  [Wolf-Doettinchem] Can this danger be eliminated? 
  [Jochimsen] We need a Maastricht II that retroactively 
improves and supplements the treaty. The creation of a political 
union that is democratically legitimized and has a federal 
structure is particularly important. But the European Central 
Bank should be strengthened as well, for example by giving 
it--and not the Council of Ministers--responsibility for 
exchange-rate policy. 
  [Wolf-Doettinchem] Does not the continuing dispute over the 
interpretation of the accession criteria show that the entire 
Maastricht Treaty is formulated too sloppily? 
  [Jochimsen] Many provisions are blurred and elastic. In the 
revision of the treaty, the convergence criteria should be made 
more rigorous and the latitude for political interpretation 
should be narrowed. 
  [Wolf-Doettinchem] The trend, however, is rather to soften 
the requirements. 
  [Jochimsen] It concerns me very greatly that the criteria 
are 
being bent to suit one's desires. Negotiations are being 
conducted as though just any political compromise were at stake. 
One cannot, after all, just insert a paragraph here and there as 
in a normal law so that as many as possible can participate. 
Much more is at issue: money that amounts to something, a 
currency that lasts. One must not fool around with that. 
  [Wolf-Doettinchem] According to the Maastricht Treaty, the 
monetary union should begin in 1997 at the earliest and by 1999 
at the latest. Do you consider that to be realistic? 
  [Jochimsen] I regard fixing a calendar date for the debate 
to 
be unwise. The crises in the European Monetary System have made 
it more than abundantly clear to us: The convergence process in 
Europe has not yet progressed far enough. Many European 
politicians have not yet understood that the issue is not to 
make the mark, that torments them so much, into community 
property, but the issue is to create a European currency that 
possesses the same quality attributes. If there is any cheating 
in this regard, the markets will discover that very quickly.

<H5>  The Overachiever </H5>
  Sixty-three-year-old Reimut Jochimsen can boast of having 
three simultaneous careers: as a scholar, a politician, and a 
central banker. The economist with a doctorate degree was a 
professor in Kiel, state secretary in the Federal Ministry for 
Education and Science, and was economics minister in North 
Rhine-Westphalia for 10 years. Since 1990, the Social Democratic 
Party of Germany [SPD] member has headed the North 
Rhine-Westphalia Land Central Bank. On the Bundesbank's Central 
Bank Council, the self-confident Jochimsen is included among the 
spokesmen. He is an advocate of European integration but also 
one of the severest critics of the Maastricht Treaty on the 
Economic and Monetary Union.
