  [Text] Representatives of the Pacific Fleet consider the 
concern of domestic and foreign nature conservationists about 
the problem of liquid radioactive waste in the Maritime Kray 
unfounded. [Video shows archive footage of nuclear submarines 
being dismantled, tankers at wharf] Valeriy Danilyan, chief of 
the fleet service of radioactive and chemical defense, related 
at a meeting with Greenpeace movement activists that the 
radioactivity of this waste was so low -- 0.07 to 0.08 curie -- 
that it could be compared to the background radiation of the Sea 
of Japan, and did not endanger it in any way. Furthermore, the 
economic expenses of constructing an unnecessary, in principle, 
complex for processing the waste promise to be very substantial. 
However, international experts do not share such a complacent 
attitude, and believe that both Russia and Japan, which 
volunteered to help it, procrastinate in an unforgivable manner 
in solving the problem of utilization of nuclear waste in the 
Maritime Kray.
