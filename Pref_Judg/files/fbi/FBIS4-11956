  [Text] Army sources told Qol Yisra'el that they do not 
expect any reduction in army service in the Hebron area in the 
wake of the agreement. It will take time for the Norwegian, 
Danish, and Italian observers to establish some framework for 
operating in the town with the IDF [Israel Defense Forces] and 
the Palestinians. In any event, Israeli officials are stressing 
that this is not a precedent and that responsibility for 
security remains with the IDF.
