  [Text] About 400,000 of Taiwan's 20 million residents are 
addicted to drugs, according to a report by the Bureau of 
Investigation. The bureau said that it has seized a total of 
1,300 kilograms of heroin last year, which was sufficient to 
supply 32,000 drug addicts for one whole year. But the seizure 
only reflected about one-tenth of the overall drugs smuggled 
into Taiwan, indicating that about 400,000 people here are 
addicted to drugs. 
  The bureau also flatly denied the report by the United 
States 
State Department that Taiwan is Asia's largest way station for 
drug shipment. Citing a record 336-kilogram heroin seizure last 
May, the Bureau of Investigation said that Taiwan will not allow 
drug barons to turn the island into a transfer port for drug 
trafficking.
