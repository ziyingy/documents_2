Russian Federation Council of Ministers] 
  [Text] Metallurgy is one of the base branches of Russia's 
industries and, along with the fuel and energy complex, largely 
determines the viability of her economy. 
  All large industrially developed countries have or strive to 
have their own effectively operating metallurgical industries. 
The developing countries are also pursuing independence in this 
field and are building large metallurgical facilities. 
  The Russian Federation's proportion of the metallurgical 
complex production among the states formerly comprising the USSR 
is 60%. In Russia, ferrous metallurgy is the principal 
supplier 
of structural materials virtually to all branches of the 
national economy and will retain its importance as a basis 
industry for a long time to come. 
  In addition to the petrochemical and forestry industry 
production, domestic ferrous metals are also finding demand in 
the world market. Export of metallurgical raw materials, 
semifinished products, and individual types of ready products is 
an important source of hard currency revenues necessary both for 
the state as a whole and for the specific metallurgy enterprises 
for the purpose of their retooling and development in the social 
sphere. 
  The potential of Russia's ferrous metallurgy is determined 
by 
the production capacities which make it possible to produce the 
following (in million tons per year):

  The partitioning of the former Soviet Union was accompanied 
by the breakup of the unified metallurgical complex, a sharp 
drop in the effective demand for metal products, and a worsening 
of the export-import shipment situation. Altogether, the 
production volume at ferrous metallurgy enterprises declined by 
17.5% in 1992 compared to 1991. 
  According to expert estimates, consumption of rolled 
products 
in Russia in 1992 decreased compared to the 1991 level by 8 
million tons (15.5%) and that of steel pipes--by 2.6 
million 
tons (28%). At the same time, certain types of metal 
products 
which are the life blood of the state economy did not find 
sufficient demand): these are transportation metal, rails and 
wheels (up to 30% of natural demand, pipes for operating 
gas 
lines and wells (up to 30%), bearing steel (up to 
40%), and 
rope (up to 20%). As a result, the capacity utilization of 
Russia's metallurgical complex facilities (Fig. 1) has declined.

  Ferrous metallurgy has a number of peculiar features which 
worsen its critical condition and call for considerable efforts 
to resolve the long-overdue interrelated problems. The most 
acute of these are the following: 

  -  an increased material-to-output and energy-to-output 
ratios of production; 
  -  a considerable depreciation of fixed production capital which 
exceeds 50% for the industry as a whole and in a number of 
enterprises--70%, and a low production level with the 
attendant 
poor production quality and competitiveness 
  -  a lack of balance in the subindustries and individual process 
stages, especially due to the disruption of relationships in the 
interbranch and intrabranch cooperation with respect to raw 
materials and semifinished products 
  -  extremely unsatisfactory environmental conditions in the 
regions with the metallurgical industry. 

    A lion's share of metallurgical production in Russia is 
manufactured by obsolete technologies using obsolete and aging 
equipment. More than 60% of steel is smelted in open 
hearth 
furnaces and 75% of steel is cast into ingots. More than 
one-half of rolled stock is produced in equipment which is at 
the 1960s level. Consequently, ferrous metallurgy production has 
elevated specific material consumption and power-to-output 
ratio. For a comparable range of assortment, almost three times 
as much waste is produced per ton of ready rolled stock than in 
Japan while the energy consumption is higher by one-third. As a 
result of an increase in consumption of resources and 
considerable labor outlays compared to today's levels, 
production expenditures at domestic enterprises are in most 
cases higher than the price of metal products in the world 
market, using world prices as a reference. Tentative estimates 
show that even at enterprises with some features of modern 
technologies, the physical and energy outlays per ton of rolled 
products in Russia are $50-70 higher than at today's foreign 
plants. 
  The principal reasons for the energy resource overruns in 
the 
principal process stages are the lower iron concentration in the 
burden, a high fines concentration in the sinter, a high 
proportion of open hearth production, a low proportion of steel 
cast in continuous casting machines (MNLZ), and a large number 
of blooming mills. Due to the technical backwardness of Russia's 
ferrous metallurgy and the resulting high production costs, 
annual losses reach $3.5-4.0 billion. 
  The breakup of the unified metallurgical complex hit 
especially hard the mineral and raw material base of ferrous 
metallurgy. Today, such metallurgical enterprises in Southern 
Urals as the Magnitogorsk Integrated Iron and Steel Works, 
Orsk-Khalilovo Integrated Iron and Steel Works, Chelyabinsk 
Integrated Iron and Steel Works, and partially the Western 
Siberian Integrated Iron and Steel Works use iron ore raw 
materials which are brought from Central Russia (up to 10 
million t/yr) and even from Kazakhstan (up to 9 million t/yr), 
yet stable shipments from these areas are far from being assured. 
  There are no deposits or enterprises which mine manganese 
and 
chromium ores whose principal reserves are located in Ukraine 
and Kazakhstan. The raw material base of the refractory industry 
is insufficient due to the depletion of the Satka magnesite 
deposit as well as the scarcity of fireclay mined in Russia. 
  Due to the considerable obsolescence of capital stock, 
metallurgy is inflicting considerable harm on the environment 
which is estimated to reach 400-450 billion rubles a year. An 
increasing stringency of environmental standards and 
requirements and the introduction of economic sanctions will 
lead to considerable economic losses for enterprises which do 
not meet these requirements. While at foreign plants with a 
total metallurgy cycle and advanced practices equipped with the 
most recent scrubbing equipment, dust ejection into the 
atmosphere reaches 1,000 t/yr per 1 million tons of steel, at 
Russian plants this indicator is several times higher (see 
table).

  Under the conditions where the metal production and 
metallurgical raw material consumption in Russia has decreased, 
the importance of export shipments is on the rise. Since the 
world market for ferrous metals has already evolved almost fully 
and is characterized by traditional ``spheres of influence,'' a 
thorough study of the issue of large metal batch shipments and a 
search for new mutually acceptable forms are necessary for 
penetrating it. 
  Russia's economy has suffered considerable harm due to an 
uncontrolled export of metals, including secondary metals. Thus, 
the use of ferrous metal scrap in production decreased by 6 
million tons in Russia in 1992 for this reason. 
  Today, the Western European and North and Central American 
markets virtually cannot expand due to the high custom duties, 
protectionist measures, and stiff competition. At the same time, 
the importance of traditional Eastern European markets for us is 
increasing while interest in Asian and African markets is on the 
rise. 
  Yet the high resource-to-output ratio of production combined 
with an insufficient quality level lead to a low competitiveness 
of most types of ready products from Russia's ferrous 
metallurgy, and only 10-15% of ready metal products can 
compete 
in the world market: electrical sheet steel (partially), 
reinforcement steel, alloy bars, rails, shipbuilding sheet 
steel, and certain other types as well as semifinished products, 
e.g., pig iron, process stage blanks, and hot-rolled coils. 
  An estimate of the likely internal and external ferrous 
metal 
market capacity makes it possible to predict the production 
volumes of rolled products to be 47-39 million tons in 1995 and 
50-55 million tons in 2000. According to expert forecasts, the 
production, domestic consumption, and exports of rolled products 
(in millions of tons) will stabilize in the next two-to-three 
years and increase somewhat by 2000.

  One should treat this forecast with considerable skepticism 
since it is based on the 1992 macroeconomic indicators which may 
change with time. One should also emphasize that ferrous 
metallurgy is characterized by considerable lagging, so crisis 
phenomena in it may be more prolonged than in the national 
economy as a whole, while the freeing of prices for the energy 
resources will inevitably aggravate the crisis since it will 
result in an invasion of imported metal products under the 
conditions where our enterprises are not competitive. 
  An analysis of the general economic conditions and the state 
of ferrous metallurgy in Russia makes it possible to draw the 
conclusion that if necessary measures in retooling the industry 
and protecting the domestic market from imported metal products 
during the modernization period as well as ensuring a controlled 
price increase for energy resources are not taken, Russian 
metallurgy will virtually cease to exist. 
  Mindful of the world experience and the economic futility of 
winding down domestic metallurgy and aiming at importing metal 
products, Russia is left with no alternatives to radical 
modernization of metallurgical production. 
  At the same time, the performance of enterprises in 1992 
demonstrated that the overhaul and retooling measures in the 
industry, including those taken at government levels, do not 
resolve a number of acute problems in the industry. Mindful of 
the fact that the task of supplying the national economy with 
metal products with the requisite quality and assortment, mostly 
the agroindustrial and fuel and energy complex, developing 
production of durable consumer goods and communication and 
transportation facilities, maintaining Russia's defense 
capabilities at the necessary level, and developing the expert 
potential while increasing the proportion of ready products as 
well as a cardinal improvement in the environmental conditions 
in the metallurgical regions is of paramount importance, the 
Russian Federation Committee on Metallurgy developed a draft of 
the national program of "Metallurgy Retooling and Development in 
Russia." 
  Completion of the program will require efforts both on part 
of the state and on part of the Metallurgical Enterprise and 
Scientific Research and Design Institute staff and management. 
The program pinpoints key issues of industrial development and 
outlines the specific and effective ways of resolving them. 
According to the program, a reduction in expenditures for 
production, primarily a decrease in the energy-to-output ratio 
and specific material consumption of production, a decrease in 
labor outlays, and an improvement in production quality 
indicators will be responsible for ensuring the economic 
efficiency of production, profitability of ferrous metallurgy 
enterprises, and guaranteeing that they receive the resources 
necessary for normal operation, including the development of 
their expert potential. 
  Realization of the national program will enable the industry 
to develop on the basis of domestic scientific developments and 
domestic equipment. This will require a system of state support 
for promising scientific developments, preservation of the 
scientific and technical potential, and financing of basic 
scientific research. 
  The retooling of metallurgy must be carried out by 
effectively utilizing the economic capabilities of the 
enterprises themselves and with state support. The principal 
problems whose solution requires state support are as follows: 
lowering the outlays of physical, energy, and labor resources; 
improving the product quality in developing new types of 
products; increasing the product competitiveness; maximizing the 
utilization and developing a domestic raw material base; and 
improving the environmental conditions. 
  State support for retooling may be expressed in various 
forms: the state should primarily make sure that highly 
efficient measures are realized primarily at the expense of 
enterprise profits thus developing the necessary prerequisites 
for the beneficial profit development conditions, e.g., export 
and import duties, credits, tax regulations, etc. 
  The program calls for the following principal technological 
production modernization trends: 

  -  comprehensively utilizing raw materials; 
  -  increasing the ore dressing degree and maximizing the scrap 
metal utilization in order to lower the energy outlays; 
  -  improving the steel melting production structure by replacing 
open hearth furnaces with modern steel melting units with steel 
casting in continuous casting machines; 
  -  setting production of individual types of metal items which 
lower the specific metal content in the national income, 
including cold rolled sheets, corrosion protected metal 
products, cold roll formed sections, etc.; 
  -  minimizing transportation outlays for raw material, 
semifinished products, and ready production shipments and 
outlays of energy resources and other materials; 
  -  maximizing the utilization of the secondary resources forming 
in the national economy. 

    Pursuant to the draft program, 60 installations at 32 
enterprises are being modernized, overhauled, or replaced 
(altogether, there are more than 200 enterprises in ferrous 
metallurgy). 
  It is expected that the national program will be carried out 
in two stages during which the following capacities will be 
brought onstream, in thousands of tons:

------------------------------------------------------------------------------- 


  Commissioning of new capacities after implementation of the 
first stage will make it possible to retire obsolete equipment, 
increase the proportion of steel made using advanced processes 
to 53.3% and continuous steel casting--to 31.6%, 
decrease the 
steel consumption for rolled products by 1.4 million tons, coke 
for pig iron--by 2.8 million tons, pig iron for steel--by 1.0 
million tons, and energy resources--by 1 million tons of 
standard fuel. 
  Implementation of the second phase will make it possible to 
increase the proportion of advanced processes to 70% and 
continuous casting--to 69%. Additionally, the metal 
outlays for 
rolled products will decrease by 2.3 million tons, pig iron for 
steel--by 1.8 million tons, and energy resources--by 1.6 million 
tons of standard fuel. 
  The use of new practices will make it possible to improve 
the 
production competitiveness, increase the expert potential, and 
reduce harmful discharges by 2.5-3 times. 
  Realization of high-priority Phase I measures stipulated by 
the national program calls for up to 300,000 tons of equipment 
and for Phase II--approximately 100,000 tons. A list from 
Sukhumi. A list of installed and upgraded equipment necessary 
for implementing the stipulated measures is summarized below:

  Domestic process equipment developed and installed in recent 
years is inferior to similar foreign equipment with respect to 
productivity, reliability, production quality, power-to-output 
ratio, mass, and overall dimensions. Thus, the metal-to-output 
ratio of the slab machines is 20% higher than that of 
similar 
foreign units while the metal casting rate is 30-40% 
lower, 
which considerably decreases their productivity. 
  The domestic machine-building industry does not manufacture 
many types of modern equipment for the fourth process stage 
shops, electrolytic tinplating and chrome plating devices, 
electrolytic cold rolled sheet zinc plating and aluminum plating 
machines, light quenching machines, strip grinding and polishing 
machines, continuous production lines for heat treatment of 
bands, and various types of dressing equipment. Principally new 
devices have not been developed for manufacturing pipes, 
nondestructive welding quality control testing devices, and pipe 
dressing machines. 
  It is patently obvious that metallurgy must be retooled on 
the basis of utilizing modern process equipment while maximizing 
the utilization of domestic machinebuilder capabilities and 
using the experience and developments of the leading foreign 
companies and even bringing them in whenever necessary. At the 
same time, we should vigorously utilize the capabilities of 
military industrial complex (VPK) enterprises which have a 
powerful engineering and production potential. 
  We need a new approach to the operation of design 
organizations. Their principal task has evolved into a thorough 
economic analysis of the conditions at enterprises, developing 
optimum solutions for maintaining and developing the production 
potential allowing for an increase in the competitiveness and 
production quality. As a rule, design decisions must be made on 
a competitive basis. 
  Implementation of the country's national metallurgy 
development program will call for new approaches from builders, 
assembly workers, and clients to construction and modernization 
of installations. Construction and modernization terms of 
complex installations must not exceed 3.5 years and must ensure 
high quality. The contractor for carrying out the work should be 
selected on a competitive basis allowing for the terms, quality, 
and agreed-upon costs.

  Overall, implementation of the measures outlined by the 
ferrous metallurgy retooling and development program will call 
for 1.6 trillion rubles at today's prices and $6.8 billion (Fig. 
2). Calculations show that the facilities necessary for 
financing the program can be raised due to internal enterprise 
resources and by engaging production user, commercial structure, 
and foreign investor resources (Fig. 3). The shortfall can be 
covered by state support.

  The Russian government must make the following decisions in 
order to provide assistance at a state level: 

  -  Maintain for the time being the adopted procedure for 
forming centralized off-budget resources due to the cost of 
production. 
  -  Extend to the enterprises participating in national program 
implementation the procedure for acquiring abroad the equipment 
which cannot be manufactured in Russia on the basis of 
credit-compensation transactions. 
  -  Free the enterprises, partially or fully, from paying customs 
duties (both export and import) in exporting the products which 
ensures hard currency earnings for purchases of process 
equipment, spares, and accessory parts. 
  -  Free the enterprises from the mandatory sale of 50% 
of foreign 
currency to the state, provided that it is used for equipment 
purchases. 
  -  Establish a procedure for transferring to the enterprise 
balance sheet the installations built due to foreign exchange 
resources at a special investment exchange rate which reflects 
the real correlation of currencies thus ensuring the 
competitiveness of metal products and largely limiting metal 
price increases. 
  -  The profits used for investment should not be taxed 
regardless 
of the amount 
  National program implementation will make it possible to 
raise 
the technical level of Russia's metallurgy, improve the 
competitiveness of domestic metal products, save jobs, radically 
improve the environmental conditions, and avoid imports. The 
total economic impact will reach approximately $3.0 billion 
annually. It is also expected that the enterprise profits may 
increase by approximately 300 billion rubles due to an 
improvement in the metal production quality and assortment. 
Furthermore, according to expert estimates, elimination of 
imports of one million tons of rolled products will make it 
possible to save approximately 10,000 metalmaker jobs which 
would otherwise require approximately 60 trillion rubles 
necessary to create these jobs. 
  Implementation of the national program measures is based on 
the mutual responsibility of the state and the enterprise: the 
state must ensure financial benefits for the program measures 
while the enterprise--meet the deadlines and ensure that each 
measure is carried out at a technical and economic level 
stipulated by the contract. In all, if the necessary investment 
and state support regime are ensured, the ferrous metallurgy 
modernization program may be largely completed by 2000-2005. 
  A radical modernization of Russia's metallurgy is an 
objective necessity and despite the considerable investments 
necessary for its implementation is economically efficient. 
Realization of the entire program should be ensured by 
implementing the clearly defined comprehensive development 
programs for each enterprise and region which will reflect 
high-priority problems with the specific mechanisms of solving 
them. The Russian Federation Committee on Metallurgy and 
economic and commercial structures set up by the metallurgical 
enterprises (corporations, concerns, the international 
metallurgy union, etc.) will participate in developing the 
specific measures under the program. 
  Successful implementation of the program is possible only in 
the case where each metallurgist and metalmaker at his workplace 
clearly understands the objectives and goals of the program and 
makes his own contribution to their realization.
