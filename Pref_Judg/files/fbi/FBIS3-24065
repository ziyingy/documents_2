Socioeconomic Situation of Khabarovsk Kray in 1993"] 
  [Text] In 1993 we did not succeed in halting the decline of 
production volumes in industry, agriculture, and capital 
construction. The volume of industrial production dropped by 22 
percent, agriculture--by 9 percent, and the volume of 
investments--by 26 percent. 
  As of 1 December 18.7 percent of the enterprises and 
organizations of the kray were operating at a loss. 
  The socioeconomic situation of Khabarovsk Kray in 1993 is 
characterized by the following basic indicators:

<H5>  FINANCES </H5>
  As of 1 December the national economy had received about 370 
billion rubles [R] in profit. Industry accounted for 54 percent 
of all the profit received. The proportion of enterprises 
operating at a loss remains high. In industry 15 percent of the 
enterprises are operating at a loss, in construction--6 percent, 
in housing and municipal services--41 percent, and in consumer 
services--47 percent. 
  The financial position of the enterprises is complicated by 
the deepening nonpayments crisis. Among the enterprises and 
organizations of industry, construction, transportation, and 
agriculture that were studied, as of 1 December 1993 defaulted 
indebtedness to suppliers amounted to R135.8 billion and had 
increased by 29 percent as compared to the preceding month. At 
the same time the volume of defaulted indebtedness of buyers and 
clients to these enterprises amounted to R237 billion or 54 
percent of the overall indebtedness of buyers, including to 
industrial enterprises--R193 billion. 
<H5>  PRIVATIZATION </H5>
  As of 1 January 1994, 939 enterprises had been privatized in 
the kray, including 618 during 1993, which is twice as many as 
in 1992. In the structure of privatized enterprises there is a 
predominance of enterprises of trade (30 percent of the overall 
number), industry (23 percent), and consumer services (24 
percent). 
  During 1993, 165 enterprises were privatized through the 
creation of joint-stock companies. 
  Of the three versions of benefits offered to the labor 
collectives, preference is given to the second, which allows 
them to own a controlling block of shares (81 percent). 
  "Small-scale" privatization is carried out mainly through 
sale in commercial competition (54 percent of the overall number 
privatized), at auctions (10 percent), and through the purchase 
of leased property (7 percent). 
  The overall earnings from privatization during 1993 amounted 
to R13.6 billion and 619,700 privatization checks. 
  The process of privatization of housing continued in the 
kray 
last year. During 1993, 74,800 apartments were sold for private 
ownership of citizens, which is three times more than during 
1992. 
  The average size of privatized apartments was 50.3 square 
meters. The largest numbers of apartments turned over for 
private ownership of citizens were in Khabarovsk--23,465 and 
Komsomolsk--18,942, and the following rayons: Amurskiy--7,847, 
Sovetsko-Gavanskiy--4,403, and imeni S. Lazo--2,925. 
<H5>  LEVEL AND INDICES OF PRICES AND RATES </H5>
  The high growth rate of prices continued in 1993. 
  The growth of wholesale prices in industry and procurement 
prices in the agro-industrial complex had an impact on the 
growth of consumer prices. In December 1993 as compared to 
December 1992 the consumer price index (inflation index) was 
1,123.3 percent. Prices of foodstuffs increased 11.3-fold after 
the beginning of the year. The highest rates of increase in 
prices were noted during July-August (July--39 percent, 
August--37 percent). In December the growth of food prices 
slowed up and amounted to 12.8 percent of those of the preceding 
month. 
  Since the beginning of the year there has been more than a 
14-fold increase in the cost of beef, mutton, sausage items, 
bread and bakery items, caramel, fresh cabbage, mineral water, 
and ice cream; 10-12-fold increase in pork, poultry meat, 
salami, macaroni items, cheeses, eggs, mayonnaise, semolina, and 
beer; seven- to ninefold increase in vegetable oil, flour, 
margarine, pastries, spices, frozen fish, onions, and carrots; 
sixfold increase in sugar, fats, rice, cocoa, chocolate, and 
honey; and four- to fivefold in butter, cottage cheese, 
buckwheat, peas, tea, instant coffee, starch, canned vegetable 
baby food, and beets. The price of potatoes went up 
considerably--43-fold. 
  At city markets in December beef cost 1.5 times more than in 
city trade, milk--three times more, sour cream--4.5 times more, 
and curds--1.4 times more. 
  Prices of nonfoodstuffs rose 10.8-fold compared to December 
1992. Thus fur and fur items increased in cost 18-fold; silk 
fabrics--13.5-fold; cotton fabrics, women's and children's 
clothing, children's footwear, furniture, and construction 
materials--10-12-fold; outer knitwear, hosiery items, and men's 
footwear--ninefold; women's footwear, perfume, haberdashery, 
watches, jewelry items, and printed publications--seven- to 
eightfold; electrical goods, radio goods, and rugs--four- to 
sixfold. 
  Prices and rates for paid services rendered to the 
population 
increased 22.9-fold, which is twice the growth rate of prices of 
consumer goods. For example, laundry services were 46 times more 
expensive, bath services--32 times, mending of sewn items and 
television sets and photography services--26-27 times, barber 
and religious services--24 times, and custom tailoring of sewn 
items and dry cleaning services--17 times. The greatest cost 
increases were for long-distance telephone calls--113-fold, 
housing and municipal services--119-fold, and services of a 
legal nature and of banking institutions--356-fold. 
  Wholesale prices of industrial products produced by 
enterprises of the kray had increased 10.4-fold in December 1993 
as compared to December 1992, including by 3.8 percent during 
December. 
  There were significant price increases in branch of lifting 
and transport machine-building--12.4-fold and in diesel 
construction--11.5-fold. The cost of producing construction 
materials increased ninefold, electric energy--sevenfold, and 
machine tool building--7.6-fold. 
  Prices for the production of consumer goods continued to 
increase. In the timber and sewing industry they increased 
15.5-fold, and leather haberdashery--11-fold. In the food 
industry the greatest rates of growth of wholesale prices were 
found in: the dairy industry--15.3-fold, meat--13.3-fold, 
confectionery--12.4-fold, wine making--12.1-fold, and bread 
baking--10.9-fold. 
  The growth of rates for freight transportation were 18.7 
times greater in December 1993 than in December 1992. The 
largest increase during the year was in the rates for rail 
transportation--22.5-fold, and automotive and air 
transportation--9.2-fold. 
<H5>  THE SOCIAL SPHERE </H5>
  THE DEMOGRAPHIC SITUATION. As before in the kray the birth 
rate is dropping while the death rate is simultaneously 
increasing, which does not provide even for simple reproduction 
of the population. 
  According to preliminary figures, as of 1 January 1994 the 
population of the kray was 1,607,200, which is almost 1 percent 
or 13,800 less than last year. 
  The number of births during 1993 was 15,500, and 
deaths--about 20,000. Thus natural population loss amounted to 
4,500. 
  The number of births per 1,000 population dropped by 
approximately 12 percent compared to the preceding year and 
amounted to 9.6, while the number of deaths by the same count 
increased by 18 percent and amounted to 12.3. 
  The main causes of death among the population continue to be 
cardiovascular diseases (51 percent of all deaths), accidents 
and poisoning (23 percent), and tumors (14 percent). It should 
be noted that the death rate from tuberculosis among the 
population in the kray is rising. As compared to 1992 the number 
of deaths from this cause increased by 30 percent and is now 250. 
  The death rate of children under one year of age is 
increasing. In 1993, 19 out of every 1,000 newborns died, and in 
1992 this figure was 16. 
  In 1993, 11,724 marriages were registered and 9,130 divorces 
were filed. As compared to 1992 the number of marriages 
decreased by 0.2 percent and the number of divorces increased by 
1 percent. 
  There is an outflow of population outside the kray. In 1993, 
28,467 people came to the kray and 38,068 left, and the 
migration balance was minus 9,601. 
  LABOR RESOURCES. The overall number of people employed in 
the 
kray's economy in 1993 was 584,700, decreasing by 5 percent as 
compared to last year. There was a considerable reduction of the 
number of people working in planning and scientific 
organizations, industry, and construction as compared to last 
year. There was an increase in the number of people employed in 
administrative organs, public education, and financial 
institutions. 
  During the period since the beginning of the year 15,000 
people have been discharged because of layoffs. About 8,400 
people are working part-time and are potentially unemployed. 
Partial unemployment affected 32,200 people, including from 
industry--19,300 (60 percent), construction--8,900 (27.6 
percent), and transportation--3,700 (11.4 percent). The overall 
number of leaves initiated by the administration amounted 
764,100 man-days. 
  The overall number of people without work who were actively 
seeking it at the end of 1993 was 24,900 or 3.4 percent of the 
economically active population. At the present time 5,794 people 
or 0.8 percent of the economically active population have the 
official status of unemployed, and during the year their number 
almost doubled. The majority of those registered as unemployed 
are women. As of the end of the year there were 4,685 of them, 
or 81 percent. Youth under 30 years of age make up almost 34 
percent of the unemployed. The average length of unemployment in 
1993 was four months, but for 246 people (4 percent) the period 
of unemployment exceeded 12 months. Unemployment compensation is 
being received by 3,615 people (62 percent). 
  The local employment services and the kray employment center 
are working to render aid to the unemployed population and 
laid-off workers in acquiring job skills or changing their 
qualifications, taking into account the change in demand on the 
labor market. 
  In 1993, 1,335 people were sent for occupational training, 
including 871 under 30 years of age. Occupational training was 
given to 684 people, of whom 23 percent were in training for the 
first time and 76 percent were going through retraining. Of 
those who went through occupational training, only 494 or 72 
percent found jobs. 
  INCOMES OF THE POPULATION. Monetary incomes of the 
population 
during 1993 amounted to R1,100 billion and as compared to 1992 
increased 10-fold in nominal value. Of the overall sum of 
monetary income, the population spent about R600 billion on 
goods and services, which is 10 times more than last year; the 
population paid taxes, various fees, and other kinds of outlays 
for a total of R180 billion, and R50 billion was deposited into 
accounts for investments and used to acquire securities. 
  The average monthly earnings of workers employed in the 
kray's in 1993 amounted to R95,700 and had increased 11-fold as 
compared to the same period of last year. In December the 
average earnings of workers amounted to R234,900 and increased 
by 34 percent as compared to the preceding month. 
  In spite of the measures taken to increase wages of workers 
in budget-financed organizations, labor compensation for workers 
in public health, public education, science and scientific 
service, culture and art is almost 60 percent lower than labor 
compensation for workers employed in the sphere of material 
production. 
  In 1993 the best paid were workers of banks and insurance 
companies (R265,800) and air and rail transportation (R157,300 
and R135,700, respectively). Last year the least was received by 
workers of science and scientific service (R58,600) and art 
(R57,600). 
  Payments of a social nature (material aid, etc.) on average 
per worker in December amounted to R18,800 and had increased 
38-fold as compared to the beginning of the year. Taking these 
payments into account, the income of one worker in December 
amounted to R253,700. 
  THE CONSUMER GOODS AND SERVICES MARKET. The production of 
consumer goods decreased by almost 10 percent. The output of the 
main kinds of food products is characterized by the following 
figures: 


                                 Actually produced        1993 in % of 1992 

Meat, including subproducts of   15,283                   81.5 
category I, tonnes 

Sausage items, tonnes            13,355                   87 

Semimanufactured meat            1,970                    93 
products, tonnes 

Whole milk products, tonnes      65,106                   77 

Canned fish, thousands of        9,695                    133 
standard cans 

Canned fruits and vegetables,    4,088                    86 
thousands of standard cans 

Flour, tonnes                    170,672                  78 

Cereals, tonnes                  22,622                   68 

Bread and bakery items, tonnes   140,555                  91.5 


Confectionery items, tonnes      29,860                   98 

Macaroni items, tonnes           9,131                    76 

Margarine products, tonnes       11,094                   56 


  The production of alcoholic beverages decreased by 9 
percent. 
  The situation is not the best in branches that produce light 
industry products. The shortage of their own circulating capital 
caused by difficulties with selling products and nonpayments by 
the customers make up one of the main factors involved in the 
reduction of production volumes. The annual commodity turnover 
in public catering in the kray in 1993 came to R463 billion. In 
the mass of commodities the population received 14 percent less 
than in 1992. 
  The nonstate sector is beginning to play an ever greater 
role 
in it. The share of the private sector in commodity turnover 
increased from 4 percent in 1992 to 16 percent according to the 
results of 1993. 
  In the structure of commodity turnover there was some 
increase in the proportion of nonfoodstuffs, which reached 38 
percent as against 36 percent a year ago. 
  The satisfaction of the needs of trade for certain kinds of 
goods is gradually improving. The supply of bread, flour, 
cereals, and dairy products is basically proceeding normally. At 
the same time the assortment and quality of the products and 
their prices do not always meet consumer demand. Items made of 
natural fur, coats, suits, television sets, and other goods for 
cultural and personal purposes and household use are always for 
sale. But the market is being filled to a considerable degree by 
deliveries from abroad. 
  The volume of sales of paid services during 1993 amounted to 
a total of R82 billion, which is about 50 percent in comparable 
prices for 1992. 
  EDUCATION. During the past school year there were 507 day 
general educational schools in operation in the kray (234,000 
students), of which 129 were schools with in-depth study of 
various subjects (18,900); their number almost doubled, and 
there are 11 gymnasiums (8,100) and nine lyceums (2,100) in 
operation. 
  There is one nonstate school in operation (59 students). 
  In regions where people of the North reside there are 4,100 
children of small ethnic groups of the North attending 131 
schools. 
  As in previous years, every third student attends the second 
shift but, additionally, the kray has 10 schools that operate on 
three shifts. The technical condition of the schools undoubtedly 
has an impact on the quality of the education. In the kray there 
are 157 schools (31 percent of the overall number) accommodating 
a total of 57,200 which are in need of capital repair, and 40 
schools (7.8 percent) accommodating 13,900 which are in 
dilapidated condition. 
  In 1993 in the VUZ's [higher educational institutions] and 
secondary specialized educational institutions of the kray, 
6,300 and 6,100 specialists were trained, respectively. Many 
graduates of day divisions experienced difficulties in finding 
employment since only half of them had been placed in jobs. 
  CONDITION OF THE ENVIRONMENT. The condition of the 
environment has a very great influence on human health. The 
ecological situation in the kray remained grim last year. There 
were 34 cases of flooding, and other overflows and discharges of 
pollutants were revealed, the total damage from which was R130 
million (of which 95 million--73 percent--was damage to land 
resources). 
  Ecological violations constituted grounds for bringing 
administrative charges against 564 people and criminal charges 
against three. The total fines collected amounted to R58 
million. The production activity of eight facilities was halted 
because of violation of the requirements of environmental 
protection legislation. 
  Capital investments totaling R6.5 billion were used for 
measures for protection of the environment and efficient use of 
natural resources. 
  LEGAL VIOLATIONS. During 1993 internal affairs organs in the 
kray registered 47,600 crimes, which was 2.7 percent more than 
in 1992. Almost one-sixth of the crimes were heinous. 
  There were 454 murders or murder attempts (11.8 percent 
more). 
  Public places were the scene of 12,200 crimes, including 
7,200 on the streets, the increase amounting to 3.3 percent and 
9.6 percent, respectively. 
  The number of crimes committed in an intoxicated condition 
increased by 23.9 percent, with a total of 8,693 of them. 
  The number of crimes involving theft of private property 
decreased by 5.2 percent, including from apartments--by 3.2 
percent. 
  There were 258 cases of grand larceny. 
  About 4,000 group crimes were registered (an increase of 7.3 
percent). 
  A total of 23,600 people were arrested for crimes. 
  The greatest rise in crime was observed in 
Ayano-Mayskiy--60.6 percent, Vikinskiy--27.5 percent, imeni S. 
Lazo--27 percent, and Verkhneburennskiy--19.4 percent--rayons in 
the kray. 
<H5>  MATERIAL PRODUCTION </H5>
  INDUSTRY. The volume of industrial production decreased by 
22 
percent in 1993, including in December--by 40 percent. 
  In branches operating in the consumer market the reduction 
of 
the output of products in December amounted to 14 percent, and 
in those that produce products for production and technical 
purposes--43 percent. 
  Each month certain productions are suspended at 30-40 
enterprises of the kray, resulting in a loss of working time 
during the year of 948,700 man-days, 54 percent of which were 
losses related to difficulties with selling the products and 41 
percent because of the lack of raw and processed materials. 
  In electric energy engineering the production volume 
decreased by 4.5 percent in 1993, and in the fuel industry--by 
27 percent. The amounts of coal extracted and gasoline produced 
were 22 percent less than in 1992. 
  Enterprises of the metallurgical industry extracted 2 
percent 
more gold than in 1992. They smelted 12 percent less steel and 
34 percent less rolled metal was produced. 
  In machine building there was a sharp drop in production in 
December, and during the year as a whole the output of products 
decreased by 27 percent. There was a considerable decrease in 
output by enterprises of the shipbuilding industry, the Daldizel 
Plant, the plant for lifting and transport equipment, the Splav 
and Amurlitmash plants, the machine tool building plant, and 
Dalenergomash. 
  Enterprises of the timber, wood-processing, and pulp and 
paper industry reduced their production volume by 24 percent, 
including commercial timber--27 percent, lumber and plywood--40 
percent, chipboard, fiberboard, and pulp--44 percent, and 
composition board--5 percent. 
  In the construction materials industry the output of brick 
decreased by 13 percent, prefabricated reinforced concrete 
elements--by 22 percent, and soft roofing materials--by 65 
percent. 
  THE AGRO-INDUSTRIAL COMPLEX. According to preliminary 
figures 
the volume of gross agricultural output was R290.7 million, 
including crop growing products--R110.4 million. As compared to 
1992 the volume of gross output decreased by R28.4 million (9 
percent). 
  Labor productivity in public agriculture decreased by 8 
percent. 
  The number of farms operating at a loss increased from 35 in 
1992 to 43 in 1993. Losses in agricultural production amounted 
to 16.2 percent as against 2.8 percent in 1992. 
  As compared to 1992 grain production increased by 23 
percent, 
potatoes--19 percent, soy beans--67 percent, and vegetables 
decreased by 22 percent. 
  The plan for procurements of all kinds of feeds was not 
fulfilled. On the kolkhozes and state agricultural enterprises 
for every one conventional head of cattle they prepared 15.5 
quintals of feed units as against 15.8 in 1992. 
  Less was procured of the following: potatoes--by 1 percent, 
vegetables--by 27 percent, and fruits and berries--by 19 percent. 
  All categories of farms sold 50,900 tonnes of cattle and 
poultry in live weight for slaughter (less than in 1992 by 12 
percent), they produced 105,000 tonnes less milk (5 percent) and 
362.4 million fewer eggs (18 percent). 
  The average milk yield per cow on the kolkhozes, sovkhozes, 
and state agricultural enterprises was 2,104 kilograms, and the 
egg production per laying hen was 217 eggs (increases of 5 
percent and 7 percent, respectively). 
  According to data from the livestock count, as of 1 January 
1994 on all categories of farms there were 107,300 head of 
cattle, including 45,200 cows, 268,500 hogs, 6,500 sheep and 
goats, and 500,830,000 head of poultry. As compared to 1992 the 
number of cattle decreased by 5,800 head, including cows--by 
2,800 head, hogs--by 43,800, and poultry--by 279,100, and the 
number of sheep and goats increased by 400 head. 
  The reduction of the number of head of livestock occurred as 
a result of their reduction at agricultural enterprises. 
  On farms belonging to the population the number of head of 
cattle increased by 4 percent, including cows--by 6 percent, and 
the number of hogs decreased by 16 percent. 
  For purposes of the development of subsidiary farms, 
agricultural enterprises of the kray sold the population 10,100 
head (24 percent less than in 1992) and 634,000 head of poultry 
(39 percent). 
  On all categories of farms 30,000 tonnes of cattle and 
poultry (in live weight) were purchased along with 54,200 tonnes 
of milk, which were 4 percent and 5 percent, respectively, more
