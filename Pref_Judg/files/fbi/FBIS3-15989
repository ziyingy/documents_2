  [Text] Vilnius, Mar 09, BNS -- Lithuanian migration 
services began to accept applications for "non-citizen travel 
documents" from people who are not Lithuanian citizens but 
permanently live in Lithuania. 
  Non-citizens are allowed to use old Soviet foreign passports 
for travel abroad until July 1. "Non-citizen travel documents" 
will be required after the date. 
  The new travel documents will be valid for two years and 
will 
have to be extended when the term expires.
