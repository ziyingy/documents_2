  [Text] Two documents that were made public today, the 
prosecutor general's letter to the U.S. attorney general and the 
justice minister's letter to the prosecutor general, demonstrate 
that the same virtues that made Gustavo de Greiff stand out as 
the man of the year are now causing him difficulties. 
  Signed by his own hand, the prosecutor's letter tells the 
U.S. attorney general that unless the United States presents 
evidence, the war against drug trafficking will be lost; 
evidence is needed to condemn people in both countries; drug 
legalization is good provided it destroys the source of funds 
for drug traffickers; and consumer countries have no policies to 
halt consumption. 
  These are four obvious truths, which nevertheless, offend 
the 
U.S. attorney general. The prosecutor is condemned for the 
virtue of speaking the truth without beating around the bush, 
which gained him admiration in Colombia. Something similar has 
happened to the government. The prosecutor has implemented 
surrender to justice policies, but the government changed the 
rules to avoid a repetition of the La Catedral Jail mistakes, 
when Escobar confessed what he wanted to. Now the confession 
must be accurate, sincere, and truthful. 
  At that time, Escobar purchased, built, and outfitted the 
prison to his needs; now imprisonment must be in high security 
jails and subject to special disciplinary regulations. The 
government wants to show the United States that it will not 
repeat past mistakes. The prosecutor only ensures law 
enforcement, as he has always done, to the admiration of the 
country.
