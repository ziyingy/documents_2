  [Text] Kuala Lumpur, May 18 (OANA/BERNAMA) -- The Royal 
Malaysian Air Force (RMAF) has taken delivery of four Beechcraft 
B200T maritime patrol aircraft, a senior official of the 
Ministry of Defence said Wednesday. 
  The U.S.-made aircraft, which were purchased from Australia, 
will complement the squadron of the Lockheed PC-3 Orion maritime 
patrol aircraft being extensively used to patrol the country's 
exclusive economic zone (EEZ) in the South China Sea. 
  The six-crew patrol aircraft, now parked at the RMAF base in 
Subang, near here, will be officially delivered to the air force 
in a ceremony next week, the official said. 
  They were flown here by RMAF crew with four Australian 
technical personnel. 
  Among the missions to be engaged in by the B200T are 
pollution detection, surface and sub-surface monitoring of the 
EEZ, inspecting off-shore installations as well as search and 
rescue (SAR). 
  The aircraft are also equipped with remote-sensing 
equipment, 
specialised avionics and sophisticated camera. 
  The Beechcraft B200T is an all-weather and night-day 
maritime 
patrol aircraft developed by Beechcraft Aircraft Corporation, a 
subsidiary of Raytheon Company, Kansas.
