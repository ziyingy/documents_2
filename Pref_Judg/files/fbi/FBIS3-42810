  [Text] 
<H5>  Production and Use of Gross Domestic Product </H5>
  Gross Domestic Product [GDP], which is calculated as the 
difference between gross production and interim consumption and 
characterizes the value of the end product destined for final 
consumption, accumulation, and export, totaled 162.3 trillion 
rubles [R], a 12-percent drop in comparable terms on 1992. This 
was due to a decline in the production of goods and services in 
most sectors of the economy, including falls of 16.2, 7, and 4 
percent in industry, construction, and agriculture respectively. 
  Almost 58 percent of GDP was used for final consumption in 
1993 against 54 percent in 1992. The proportion of accumulation 
in GDP dropped 6.2 percent in 1993. 
<H6>  Industry </H6>
  Physical production dropped 16.2 percent compared with 1992 
and 16.1 percent in December. Civilian and military output 
dropped 15.9 and 29 percent respectively (the figures were 12 
and 42 percent respectively in 1992). 
  In 1993 total industrial production was 37 percent down on 
1990, including 28 percent and 38 percent in extraction and 
processing sectors respectively. 
  In 1993 the greatest fall in production compared with the 
same period in 1992 was recorded in January (21.8 percent) and 
the smallest in August (12 percent). 
  Production of 234 out of 262 categories of reported 
industrial output (89 percent) fell, while production of 28 
products (11 percent) rose. 
  The scale of the production decline differs considerably 
among sectors and among spheres of production. Production of 
fuel and raw material resources dropped 3-12 percent, along with 
investment output (20-40 percent), output intended for 
agriculture (22-41 percent), basic foodstuffs (10-24 percent), 
and light industry goods (13-34 percent). Production of some 
categories of high-technology household goods increased 8-9 
percent. 
  Last year it did not prove possible to carry out the 
comprehensive structural reorganization of industry, and the 
sector showed a stronger trend toward a more cumbersome 
production structure. 
  In fuel and energy sectors, in standard equivalent terms, 
extraction and production of all categories of primary energy 
resources dropped 6 percent compared with 1992. Some 956 
billion kilowatt-hours of electricity (5 percent down on 1992) 
were generated and 352 million tonnes of oil, including gas 
condensate, (down 12 percent), 618 billion cubic meters of gas 
(down 3 percent), and 305 million tonnes of coal (down 9 
percent) were extracted. 
  In ferrous metallurgy in 1993 production of basic categories 
of output dropped owing to the fall in demand: 40.5 million 
tonnes of cast iron were extracted (down 12 percent on 1992), 
along with 58.3 million tonnes of steel (down 13 percent), while 
42.7 million tonnes of finished rolled iron (down 9 percent) and 
5.8 million tonnes of steel pipe (down 28 percent) were 
produced. Many progressive kinds of metal output suffered the 
greatest production falls. 
  In the machine-building industry production of many goods 
dropped considerably owing to the decline in customers' 
purchasing power: Production of one-fourth of 62 highly 
important categories of output reported dropped 20-40 percent, 
while production of one-third of these goods was down 50 percent 
or more. 
  Production of high-technology output dropped, in particular 
metal-cutting tools and forging and pressing machines with 
digital program control -- down by a factor of four or five. 
Production of railroad and agricultural machine-building and of 
construction equipment dropped (30-70 percent). 
  Production of automobile industry output for which there is 
a 
relatively steady demand dropped the least. In 1993, 956,000 
automobiles and 47,200 buses were produced (99.3 and 98 percent 
of the 1992 level respectively). 
  Structural transformations in defense industry sectors in 
connection with the conversion of military production were a 
typical feature of the past year. Production fell 11 percent at 
enterprises undergoing conversion. Civilian output makes up 
around three-fourths of the total production at enterprises 
undergoing conversion. Two-thirds of the work force are 
employed in producing this output. 
  In the chemical and petrochemical industries 9.9 million 
tonnes of synthetic ammonia were produced (7 percent down on the 
1992 level), along with 8.2 million tonnes of sulfuric acid 
(down 15 percent), 2 million tonnes of soda ash (down 26 
percent), 1.4 million tonnes of caustic soda (down 22 percent), 
8.6 million tonnes of mineral fertilizers (down 22 percent), 
349,000 tonnes of chemical fibers and yarns (down 26 percent), 
and 36.1 million automobile tires (down 14 percent). 
  The chemical and pharmaceutical industry reduced production 
of 11 out of 16 highly important pharmacotherapeutic 
preparations. 
  Production of commercial timber dropped by more than 
one-fourth in the timber procurement industry compared with 1992. 
  Production of the most important categories of woodworking 
and pulp and paper industry output dropped considerably. In 
1993, production of lumber totaled 39.9 million cubic meters (25 
percent down on the 1992 level), pit props -- 450,000 cubic 
meters (down 55 percent), commercial pulp -- 1.6 million tonnes 
(down 21 percent), and paper -- 2.9 million tonnes (down 20 
percent). 
  The fall in production and technical construction resulted 
in 
a drop in production in the construction materials industry. 
Some 50.1 million tonnes of cement (19 percent down on 1992), 
3,249 million standard slates (down 28 percent), 19.1 billion 
bricks (down 12 percent), and 101 million square meters of 
window glass (down 13 percent) were produced. 
  In 1993, light industry enterprises produced 3.7 billion 
square meters of fabric (27 percent down on the 1992 level), 547 
million pairs of hosiery (down 13 percent), 340 million items of 
knitwear (down 26 percent), and 146 million pairs of footwear 
(down 34 percent). 
  Varying situations developed with regard to the production 
of 
everyday and domestic goods. Production of ice boxes and 
freezers in 1993 totaled 3.5 million (9 percent up on 1992), 
televisions -- 4 million (8 percent up), washing machines -- 3.9 
million (10 percent down), sewing machines -- 1.4 million (13 
percent down), tape recorders -- 2.2 million (20 percent down), 
and video recorders -- 270,000 (39 percent down on 1992). 
  In 1993 the fall in production of certain foodstuffs slowed: 
4.0 million tonnes of meat were produced, along with 8.2 million 
tonnes of whole milk products, 1.1 million tonnes of vegetable 
oil, and 3.9 million tonnes of sugar. Production of vegetable 
oil, semimanufactured meat products, fatty cheeses and Caucasian 
cheeses, canned dairy products, and mayonnaise increased. 
<H6>  Capital Construction </H6>
  In 1993, enterprises under all forms of ownership in the 
Russian Federation absorbed R25.2 trillion in capital 
investment. State enterprises and organizations (59 percent) 
and joint-stock companies (29 percent as opposed to 6.7 percent 
in 1992) account for the largest proportion of absorbed capital 
investment. 
  Some R15 trillion, or 60 percent, of all capital 
investments, 
was utilized on the construction of production installations. 
The greatest proportion of production investment was channeled 
into the development of the fuel and energy complex (around 40 
percent), the agro-industrial complex -- 18 percent, machine 
building -- 7 percent, and the chemicals, timber, and 
construction complexes -- 5 percent apiece. 
  Some 193 of the 652 Federal Investment Program installations 
due to be commissioned in 1993 actually were commissioned (122 
in their entirety, while capacities are being partially 
commissioned at the remaining 71). The program was 30-percent 
fulfilled, including 42 percent at budget-funded installations 
and 26 percent at those funded using credit investment resources. 
  Unfinished construction work is continuing to pile up. In 
1993 the amount of unfinished construction is estimated to have 
risen 20-25 percent. Production installations account for over 
two-thirds of this. 
  In 1993 the pace of nonproduction construction dropped less 
than in the production sphere, making it possible to somewhat 
increase the amount of housing and a number of other social 
installations commissioned compared with 1992. 
  In 1993, enterprises under all forms of ownership built 
apartment blocks with a total area of 41.8 million square 
meters, or 100.7 percent of the 1992 level (68 percent of the 
1990 level). 
  Enterprises and organizations under all forms of ownership 
commissioned general education schools providing 299,600 places 
(1 percent down on 1992), preschool establishments providing 
61,500 places (36 percent down), hospitals with 14,300 beds (75 
percent up), and outpatient care facilities capable of 
accommodating 45,900 patients per shift (16 percent up). 
<H6>  Agriculture </H6>
  By the end of 1993 over 24,000 kolkhozes and sovkhozes, or 
95 
percent, had been reregistered. Companies of various kinds 
(numbering 11,500) became the main organizational and legal form 
of economic activity. Around 300 open-type joint-stock 
companies, over 400 enterprise and organization subsidiary 
farms, 2,000 agricultural cooperatives, and 3,000 other 
enterprises under new organizational and legal forms of economic 
management were created from reorganized kolkhozes and 
sovkhozes. The collectives of one in three farms decided to 
retain their enterprise's status. As of now agricultural 
enterprises with a state form of ownership account for no more 
than 15 percent of agricultural land and the value of output 
produced. 
  Owing to the increasing difficulties with material and 
technical supplies, the deterioration in the financial position, 
and other factors 14,000 private farms ceased their activity in 
1993. 
  In 1993, gross agricultural production at comparable prices 
fell 4 percent on the previous year; however, the value of gross 
output on the population's personal subsidiary plots rose 4 
percent. 
  Some 99 million tonnes of grain were harvested in 1993 (93 
percent of the 1992 level). The harvests of sugar beet (25.5 
million tonnes), potatoes (38.1 million tonnes), and vegetables 
(9.8 million tonnes) remained at roughly the 1992 level. The 
gross sunflower seed and flax fiber crops totaled 2.8 million 
and 58,000 tonnes (11 and 26 percent down on 1992 respectively). 
The sowing of winter crops and plowing of fall plowland lagged 
appreciably behind 1992. An area of 15.5 million hectares of 
winter crops has been sown (20 percent down on 1992), including 
14.3 million hectares of grain (20 percent down). The winter 
rye crop lands dropped the most (34 percent), while the winter 
wheat and barley crop lands dropped less (12 and 6 percent 
respectively). An area of 41.9 million hectares of fall 
plowland was plowed -- 6.2 million hectares down (13 percent) on 
fall 1992. 
  A decline in receipts of produce from agricultural 
enterprises' farms and the simultaneous increase in production 
at personal plots was typical of livestock farming in 1992. 
Production of meat on all categories of farms was down by 
860,000 tonnes live weight (7 percent) on 1992, while production 
of eggs dropped by 2.6 billion (6 percent) and wool by 18,500 
tonnes (10 percent). The slump in milk production was halted, 
with production remaining at the previous year's level. 
  As of 1 January 1994 there were 48.9 million head of cattle 
[krupnyy skot] on all categories of farms (6 percent down on the 
same date in 1993), 19.8 million cows (down 2 percent), 28.5 
million hogs (down 10 percent), and 43.6 million sheep and goats 
(down 15 percent). At the same time there was an increase in 
the number of livestock on the population's farms: Numbers of 
cattle, cows, and hogs were up 4, 6, and 2 percent respectively. 
  The proportion of cattle owned by citizens has risen over 
the 
past three years -- from 17 to 25 percent, while that of cows 
has risen from 25 to 34 percent, hogs -- from 18 to 28 percent, 
and sheep and goats -- from 28 to 38 percent. 
<H6>  Transport and Communications </H6>
  In 1993, freight shipments fell as a result of the 
continuing 
decline in output production. The amount of freight shipped by 
transport in public use fell by 1.2 billion tonnes (25 percent) 
compared with 1992 to total 3.6 billion tonnes. Freight 
shipments were down 18 percent by rail, 40 percent by road, 8 
percent by the merchant marine, 31 percent by internal 
waterways, 28 percent by air, and 8 percent by pipeline. 
  Freight shipments by internal water transport in public use 
to parts of the Far North and equivalent localities were 
virtually complete in October. From the start of the shipping 
season the river fleet dispatched 35 million tonnes of freight 
to these areas, 24 percent down on 1992, while maritime 
transport accounted for around 8 million tonnes of freight (down 
28 percent). 
  Public transport passenger turnover dropped 5 percent in 
1993 
compared with 1992. Some passenger flow switched to relatively 
cheaper railroad transport, where passenger turnover rose 7 
percent. Road transport passenger turnover dropped 6 percent, 
while passenger turnover on the internal waterways and by air 
was down 16 and 29 percent respectively. Notwithstanding a 
37-percent drop in passenger turnover on domestic air routes, a 
29-percent increase was recorded on international routes. 
  Over the year communications enterprises provided services 
totaling R1.6 trillion, including R314 billion in consumer 
services, which represents a 12-fold increase on 1992 at 
effective prices. At the same time the volume of communications 
services is still falling in real terms. Thus over 11 million 
requests for domestic telephone installation have still not been 
met. 
<H6>  The Consumer Market </H6>
  In 1993 the population was sold goods and services via all 
sales channels worth R65.2 trillion, which represents a 
10.7-fold increase on 1992 at actual prices; at comparable 
prices the figure is virtually the same as the 1992 level (down 
0.5 percent). Spending on consumer goods and services from 
unorganized trading outlets accounts for around 40 percent of 
this. 
  Compared with 1992 the retail trade network was more 
saturated with goods. Whereas in 1992 the food and nonfood 
availability coefficients at retail trade outlets were around 50 
and 70 percent respectively, in 1993 the figures were 60-70 and 
80-90 percent. Compared with 1992 the retail trade saturation 
index hovered around 120-130 percent. 
  The private sector (including consumer cooperatives) 
accounted for 71 percent of commodity turnover (62 percent in 
1992), while the state sector and other nonstate forms of 
ownership accounted for 25 percent (27 percent) and 4 percent (1 
percent) respectively. 
  Certain changes in the structure of retail commodity 
turnover 
occurred in 1993 with the increase in the population's monetary 
income and their acclimatization to the new prices: the 
proportion of foodstuffs dropped from 55 to 53 percent, while 
nonfood commodities rose from 45 to 47 percent. 
  In 1993, Russia's population was provided with paid services 
to the value of R6.4 trillion, which in actual prices 
represented a 12-fold increase on the 1992 level, but a 
30-percent drop in comparable prices. Consumer services 
accounted for R1.1 trillion rules, a 38-percent drop in real 
terms on 1992. 
<H5>  Foreign Economic Ties With Distant Foreign Countries </H5>
  In 1993 Russia's foreign trade turnover (excluding the CIS 
countries), allowing for imports and exports by private 
individuals, totaled $70 billion, a 12-percent drop at current 
prices compared with 1992. 
  Exports were equivalent to $43 billion and rose 1.4 percent, 
including $25 billion to industrially developed countries (a 
1.2-percent rise), $6 billion to developing countries (a 
39-percent rise), and $12 billion to other countries (the former 
CEMA countries, the republics of the former Yugoslavia, China, 
the DPRK, and the Baltic countries), representing a 5-percent 
drop. 
  Fuel and energy resources accounted for 48 percent of the 
export commodity structure in 1993, including crude oil -- 19.1 
percent, natural gas -- 17.0 percent, and petroleum products -- 
8.0 percent; machines and equipment represented 6.7 percent of 
total exports. 
  In 1993, Russian imports totaled $27 billion, or 27 percent 
down on 1992, including $16.4 billion from industrially 
developed countries (down 31 percent), $2.9 billion from 
developing countries (down 39 percent), and $7.7 billion from 
other countries (down 11 percent on 1992). 
  Machines and equipment accounted for 26.5 percent of total 
imports in 1993, while grain accounted for 5.8 percent, textiles 
and knitted clothing -- 4.5 percent, and sugar (including raw 
sugar) -- 3.0 percent. 
  There was a positive balance of trade in 1993 of $16.0 
billion (in 1992 the positive balance was $5.4 billion). 
<H5>  Foreign Economic Ties With Nearby Foreign Countries </H5>
  Foreign trade turnover with the nearby foreign countries 
totaled R22.5 trillion in 1993, or just 50 percent of the 1991 
level. In this period there has been a drop in shipments from 
Russia to the CIS states of oil -- 60 percent, natural gas -- 8 
percent, coal -- 68 percent, automobile gasoline -- 60 percent, 
and rolled metal -- 64 percent. Fuel resources are the 
top-priority export from Russia (accounting for 88 percent of 
total production and technical exports as against 51 percent in 
1992). 
  These debts are being partially paid off by means of state 
loans, which Russia has granted the CIS countries. What is 
more, more extensive use of payments in national currencies at 
an agreed rate of exchange. 
<H5>  Privatization </H5>
  Some 39,000 enterprises were privatized in the period 
January-November, and 36,000 [figure as published] enterprises 
have been privatized in total since privatization began in 
Russia. Some 31 percent of the total number of enterprises 
privatized in the first 11 months of 1993 have switched to 
private ownership by means of flotation (entirely or in part), 
while 69 percent have been sold. 
  Enterprises in the retail and wholesale trade sphere account 
for 35 percent of the total number of privatized enterprises, 
industry -- 29 percent, consumer services -- 18 percent, 
construction -- 9 percent, public catering -- 7 percent, the 
automobile industry -- 3 percent, and agriculture -- 2 percent. 
  The enterprises privatized in the period January-October (in 
terms of residual value at the prices before their fixed capital 
was revalued in 1992) had a total value of over R753 billion. 
  The average value of one privatized enterprise in municipal, 
territorial, and federal ownership was R12 million, R16 million, 
and R54 million respectively. 
  Preference continued to be given during flotation to Option 
2 
of the three options for concessions that labor collectives were 
given -- the option which allows the labor collective to own the 
controlling block of shares. Over three-fourths of the 
enterprises that became joint-stock companies chose this option 
for concessions. One-sixth of enterprises were floated under 
Option 3, while around 1 percent opted for Option 1. In 
addition, some enterprises (3.3 percent) were floated by 
transforming leasehold enterprises. 
  Large and medium-sized enterprises were in the main 
privatized by means of flotation. Of the enterprises privatized 
in the period January-November by means of flotation the state 
was assigned the controlling block of shares in 305 (2.7 
percent), and the state holds the "golden" share in another 158 
(1.4 percent) enterprises. The majority of these enterprises are 
in industry (54 percent) and construction (12 percent). 
  Small enterprises were generally privatized by being sold 
and 
in effect without restrictions imposed by the state. Some 44 
percent of enterprises were sold by commercial tender, 43 
percent by buying up leased property, and 9 percent at auction. 
  The average rate of value of the enterprises sold (the ratio 
of the sale price to the initial price) in the period 
January-November was 5.7 (3.2 in 1992); the rate was 7.2 at 
enterprises assigned to municipal ownership, 3.3 for those in 
territorial ownership, and 2.3 for enterprises in federal 
ownership. 
  Some 13 percent of the floated enterprises sold all the 
shares for sale, while over three-fourths of the number of 
enterprises privatized by sale paid the full purchase contract 
price. 
  Monetary resources totaling R340 billion and 40 million 
privatization checks were obtained from the privatization of 
enterprises in January-November (including money from 
enterprises privatized in 1992). 
  Some R181 billion rubles (53 percent of total money revenue) 
and 6.2 million checks (16 percent of the total number of 
redeemed privatization checks) were obtained from the 
privatization of municipally-owned enterprises, while the 
figures were R56 billion (17 percent) and 9.6 million checks (24 
percent) respectively for enterprises in territorial ownership 
and R103 billion (30 percent) and 24.2 million checks (60 
percent) respectively for enterprises in federal ownership. The 
territories' budgets, the federal budget, and state 
privatization bodies received 64 percent, 20 percent, and 16 
percent of the revenue respectively. 
<H5>  Development of Market Structures </H5>
  The development of a market infrastructure for the Russian 
Federation is currently undergoing certain changes. A gradual 
reduction in the number of exchanges is being observed. Around 
180 of the 303 exchanges that had received a license were in 
operation by the end of 1993, of which 40 were working steadily 
and holding auctions twice a week or more. The six largest 
commodity exchanges, four of them in Moscow and one each in 
Saratov and Omsk, accounted for the bulk of exchange commodity 
turnover (40 percent). 
  According to preliminary figures, exchange turnover totaled 
R1.6 trillion in 1993, a 4.5-fold increase at current prices on 
1992 turnover. The amount of production and technical output 
and consumer goods dropped in the exchange turnover structure 
(from 65 to 41 percent and from 31 to 12 percent respectively). 
  Operations involving monetary resources and securities 
expanded at stock exchanges. Total sales in overall exchange 
turnover rose from 3 percent in 1992 to 46 percent in 1993. 
  By the end of 1993 around 2,000 commercial and cooperative 
banks with Bank of Russia licenses to conduct banking operations 
and around 4,000 branches (excluding the Russian Federation 
Savings Bank) had been registered. 
  Around one-third of the total number of commercial banks 
have 
been organized on the basis of former special banks and over 60 
percent are newly-formed banks. 
  Commercial banks are given 80 percent of the total credit 
investment in the national economy. 
<H5>  Prices </H5>
  Prices of consumer goods and paid services rose by a factor 
of 9.4 in 1993 compared with December 1992, including increases 
by a factor of 9.0 for food (including alcoholic beverages), 7.4 
for nonfood commodities, and 24.1 for consumer services. Prices 
on city markets rose by a factor of nine, including factors of 
8.5 and 10 for crop farming and livestock farming output 
respectively. 
  In 1993 the dynamics of inflationary processes developed as 
follows. During the first half of 1993 the composite consumer 
price index dropped from 125 percent in January to 118 percent 
in May. However, early in the second half of the year the rate 
of inflation once again began to rise. In July consumer prices 
rose at a rate of 122 percent and the figure was 126 percent in 
August. In the fall, price increases slowed, totaling 123 
percent in September, 120 percent in October, 116 percent in 
November, and 113 percent in December. 
  In 1993, the rate of increase in consumer prices was close 
to 
that of manufacturing enterprises' prices. Industrial 
manufacturers' and agricultural producers' prices rose by 
factors of 10 and 8.5 respectively on average over the year 
compared with December 1992. Prices of capital investment 
projects rose by a factor of 11.6, including an 11.9-fold 
increase for construction and installation work. 
<H5>  Finances </H5>
  In 1993 the consolidated Russian Federation budget was 
implemented with income of R53 trillion and expenditure of R64 
trillion. The budget deficit was around R11 trillion (7 percent 
of GDP) and rose compared with 1992 by more than 18 times, 
notwithstanding a 10-fold rise in the inflation rate. 
  Federal budget income for 1993 (estimated) totaled R29.4 
trillion rubles. Following the indexation of the main items of 
expenditure and new expenditure for which provision had not 
previously been made, the federal budget deficit topped R12 
trillion (7 percent [as published] of GDP). 
  Credit provision in the national economy totaled R30.5 
trillion at the beginning of 1994, a six-fold increase on early 
1993, and totaled 19 percent of GDP as opposed to 28 percent in 
early 1993. 
  Because of the continuing inflation, monetary resources are 
provided on a short-term basis. In 1993 a reduction was 
recorded in the proportion of long-term credit granted for terms 
of over a year. It dropped in overall credit provision from 5 
percent in the first quarter to 3 percent by the end of the year. 
<H5>  The Population's Living Standards and Income </H5>
  The population's money income, counting the income of people 
engaged in entrepreneurial activity, totaled R78.3 trillion 
rubles in 1993, an 11-fold increase on 1992. Of this increase 
in income figure, wage increases accounted for 73 percent, 
social payments accounted for 16 percent, and other income 
accounted for 11 percent. 
  Measured against the consumer price index, money incomes 
increased 9 percent and disposable money income 10 percent. 
  The proportion of income from state and cooperative 
organizations dropped in the structure of families' incomes from 
78 to 74 percent, while the proportion of social payments rose 
from 13 to 15 percent and other income (from selling food, 
livestock, buildings, and income for handicrafts and trades) 
rose from 9 to 11 percent. 
  For the bulk of the population wages were the main source of 
money income. The average wage in Russian economic sectors was 
R141,200 in December 1993, a 39-percent increase on November. 
  In 1993, pension payments were revised quarterly. The 
minimum old age-pension rose from R2,250 in January to R26,320 
in December 1993 (including compensatory payments). It is 
estimated that the average fixed monthly pension overall stood 
at R39,400, with old age pensions at R41,400. 
  The stratification of society into rich and poor is 
proceeding at a rapid pace. At present the income of the most 
well-off 10 percent is 11 times that of the least well-off, 
whereas this figure was 7.5-8 in late 1992 and 4.5 in 1991. By 
the end of 1993 there were 40 million people (27 percent of the 
total population) with average per capita money incomes below 
the subsistence minimum. In December that minimum averaged 
R42,800 per capita, including R48,400 for the working 
population, R30,200 for pensioners, and R42,800 for children. 
  The differentiation of the population in terms of property 
is 
not as great as that in terms of income. According to a 
Russia-wide survey of households, families with incomes below 
the minimum subsistence level have 8 percent fewer refrigerators 
than other families, 11 percent fewer washing machines, 26 
percent fewer color televisions, 20 percent fewer sewing 
machines, and 25 percent fewer tape recorders and wall units. 
<H5>  Employment </H5>
  In 1993, there were 71 million people, or 48 percent of the 
total population, employed in the Russian economy. The nonstate 
sector, in which over 40 percent of workers are now employed, is 
playing an ever-increasing role. 
  In 1993 compared with 1992 the number of personnel increased 
in the main sectors of the social complex -- public education 
and the health service. The number of people employed in credit 
provision and state insurance, tax inspectorates, notaries' 
offices, and legal services is steadily rising -- which is 
evidence that the infrastructure characteristic of a market 
economy is starting to take shape. However, the number of 
people employed in science and the scientific service sphere, 
design, and research organizations dropped. 
  At the end of 1993 there was a total of 7.8 million people 
-- 
or 10.4 percent of the economically active population -- without 
work or actively seeking work in addition to those not in full 
employment (the potential unemployed). Some 3.8 million (5.1 
percent) of the letter are classified as unemployed in 
accordance with International Labor Organization methodology. 
Some 0.8 million people, or 1.1 percent of the economically 
active population, have official unemployed status. 
  In 1993, strikes of one day or more were recorded at 265 
enterprises, establishments, and organizations in Russia -- 
one-fourth of the 1992 figure. 
<H5>  The Demographic Situation </H5>
  In 1993 the population of the country fell by 300,000, or 
0.2 
percent, to 148.4 million at the beginning of 1994. This is due 
to adverse changes in the birth and death rates determined not 
only by the present situation but also by the nature of past 
demographic development. 
  In 1993, 1.4 million babies were born, 226,000 or 14 percent 
down on 1992. The birth rate per 1,000 dropped from 10.7 to 9.2. 
  The number of deaths over the year rose by 360,000, or 20 
percent, to 2.2 million, and the total death rate per 1,000 rose 
to 14.6 against 12.2; 348,000 people died from injuries or 
poisoning -- a 1.4-fold increase on 1992. 
  The death rate among the working-age population increased 
faster, increasing by one-third over the year, while the 
proportion of people of this age among total deaths rose to 30 
percent as opposed to 27 percent in 1992. 
  Adverse changes in the birth and death rates brought an 
increase in natural population loss: 800,000, or 60 percent, 
more deaths were recorded than births (in 1992 the figure was 
220,000, or 14 percent).
