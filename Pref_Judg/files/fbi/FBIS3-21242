<H5>  The Beginnings of Earth Observation </H5>
  The history of earth observation with satellites began with 
mankind's first satellite, Sputnik-1, launched by the former 
USSR in 1957. Following on from this, the United States and the 
former USSR, sent up satellites one after another. 
  Amongst these early satellites, Explorer-6, launched by the 
United States in 1959 was a breakthrough for earth observation. 
It was the first satellite to photograph the Earth from space. 
In the same year, the former USSR used a satellite to photograph 
the dark side of the moon for the first time. 
  The next big leap was to be in 1961, when Vostok-1, the 
first 
manned space ship, was launched by the former USSR. Cosmonaut 
Yuri Gagarin on board this primitive space ship was the first 
man in space, a tremendous step in man's history. 
  Scores of astronauts have since that time had the 
opportunity 
to realize the beauty of the Earth and the frail thinness of the 
layers of Earth's life-supporting atmosphere. Manned satellites 
gave us a new viewpoint of our planet. 
  The first earth observation satellite, LANDSAT-1, was 
launched by the United States in 1972. This was followed by 
another five LANDSATs. Out of these, two, LANDSAT-4 and 
LANDSAT-5, are still in operation. 
  In the latter half of the 1970's, the two superpowers were 
joined by a new face. Japan started earth observation in earnest 
at this time. 
<H5>  Japan's Earth Observation </H5>
  Five years after LANDSAT-1, in 1977, Japan launched a 
geostationary meteorological satellite called Himawari-1. This 
satellite was put in operation and run by the Meteorological 
Agency the following year. 
  In 1978, the Earth Observation Center of the National Space 
Development Agency was established in Saitama Prefecture, north 
of Tokyo. Initially, the center was set up to receive and record 
data from LANDSAT-2 and LANDSAT-3. This function still continues 
to the present day. The data were used to make composite 
photographs of the Japanese landmass and sales of photographs to 
users started. The Earth Observation Center continued to expand 
developing its initial functions until it became the key organ 
for earth observation that it is today. 
  Meanwhile, four satellites in the Himawari series have been 
launched so far. 
  The data from the Himawari satellites are utilized mainly by 
the Meteorological Agency for the prediction of adverse weather 
conditions such as typhoons and heavy rain and snowfall in 
addition to normal weather forecasting. The images taken by 
Himawari appear in TV weather forecasts and weather columns in 
newspapers. TV stations also compose the images and use computer 
graphics to superimpose cloud movements when typhoons approach 
and so on. Such weather information is now a vital part of 
everyday life. 
  The first marine observation satellite Momo-1 was launched 
in 
1987, ten years after the Himawari-1. This was followed by 
Momo-1b, which was mounted with the same observation equipment 
as that of Momo-1, in 1990. The 1b unit has the same orbit as 
Momo-1 and is set at an angle of 180 degrees. 
  The purpose of developing the marine observation satellite 
No. 1 was to establish the basic technology needed to make earth 
observation satellites. This task included development of 
observation equipment to be mounted on the Momo-1, confirmation 
of the functions of the equipment and use of the equipment to 
make experimental observations of the Earth. Momo-1 carries 
three kinds of equipment to observe the following: 
  --Distribution of plants, situation of land utilization, 
geological features, distribution of snow on land, disaster 
prevention, etc. 
  --Water temperature on sea surface, conditions of ocean 
currents, red tide, conditions of water contamination, etc. 
  --Volumeof vapor in atmosphere, ice floes, snow on ground, 
etc. 
  In addition, Momo-1 has a function to collect data from 
buoys 
floating on the ocean and a basic experiment was also carried 
out using this system. 
  After completing its initially scheduled two-year service 
with no malfunction, Momo-1 is still in operation. The satellite 
Momo-1b, as a successor to the Momo-1, is continuing to observe 
the ocean, in particular, and the whole Earth. 
  The most recent in the series is the earth resources 
satellite Fuyo-1, which was launched last year. Fuyo-1 was 
developed in order to evolve observation equipment, including a 
high-performance radar, to confirm the functions of the 
equipment and establish a comprehensive system for earth 
resources observation. 
  Fuyo-1's main purpose is to probe resources, but the 
satellite also serves to survey national land and observe the 
conditions of agriculture, forestry and fisheries and 
environmental preservation, to prevent disasters and to keep a 
watch on coastal waters. 
  The observation equipment on board the Momo-1 is capable of 
checking the undulations and inclinations of land surfaces even 
under rainy conditions and at night. It is also able to observe 
land shapes in three dimensions and distinguish rocks, minerals, 
etc. 
  Japan's earth observation technology is thus shifting from 
an 
experimental stage to a stage of new development, in which the 
technology is widely recognized as effective. It will soon 
become important for Japan to show what she can offer to 
international society. 
<H5>  Future Plans </H5>
  Under development now are the Advanced Earth Observing 
Satellite (ADEOS) and Tropical Rainfall Measuring Mission (TRMM). 
  ADEOS is designed to succeed the marine observation 
satellite 
and the earth resources satellite to continue collection of 
data in earth observation. The development of ADEOS is also 
aimed at developing new technology that will be required in 
order to develop future earth observation satellites. 
  A total of eight kinds of observation equipment, of which 
two 
will be supplied by the National Space Development Agency and 
six will be selected from among those offered generally, will be 
mounted on ADEOS. The function of this equipment is to observe 
the marine climate, the ozone layer, etc. 
  The following are the missions for NASDA's two observation 
apparatuses: 
  --Frequent acquisition of data on water color and water 
temperature of oceans and detection of chlorophyll density, 
floating materials and dissolved substances. (These missions 
will give data on the volume of substances produced by marine 
activities, the mechanism of the circulation of carbon dioxide 
gas and conditions for fishing operations.) 
  --Observation of land and coastal waters and surveys of the 
destruction of tropical forests, desertification and water 
contamination. The equipment will also be able to serve in 
surveys of land use and to probe resources. 
  TRMM will make observations on global-scale climatic 
changes, 
such as the El Nino phenomenon and desertification. To solve the 
mystery of climatic changes, it is necessary to make 
comprehensive observations of the atmosphere, oceans and land 
over a long period of time. It is particularly important to 
observe the circulation of water and energy (heat). For this 
reason TRMM will observe rainfall and radiation of heat from the 
ground surface. 
  These observations should be conducted on a global scale, 
but 
special emphasis will be placed on the tropical regions, because 
two-thirds of the rainfall on the earth occurs there. 
  The TRMM project is being jointly promoted by Japan and the 
United States. On this side, NASDA of Japan is to launch the 
satellite with an H-II rocket and to develop radar apparatus for 
rainfall observation, while NASA in the United States is to 
develop the main body of the satellite and the remaining 
observation equipment. The United States is also in charge of 
operating TRMM after its launch, using a data relay satellite. 
  Two further satellites, ADEOS-II and High Resolution 
Observation Satellite, HIROS are under development. They will be 
launched to succeed the above satellites in operation and 
continue to collect data and to improve observation functions. 
ADEOS-II will be launched in 1999 mainly to conduct global-scale 
earth observation as a successor to ADEOS. 
  HIROS will be utilized for map drawing and disaster 
prevention, as it is capable of gathering detailed information. 
Its launch is scheduled for the year 2000. 
<H5>  Postscript </H5>
  The technology for earth observation is thus about to enter 
a 
mature stage. The important issue from now will be how to make 
use of it, using the given means. The following are some of the 
expected applications: 
  (i) Use of satellites for weather forecasting and other 
activities which directly affects peoples' daily lives 
  (ii) To serve in national land development, covering 
agriculture, fisheries, urban development, etc., and to probe 
resources 
  (iii) To watch for disasters and enable effective 
countermeasures 
  (iv) To understand what is happening on the Earth and to 
enrich man's fund of useful knowledge 
  (v) To balance the development and preservation of 
environment. To use satellites to find the most effective method 
to solve earth environmental problems, by warning the need to 
curb human activities, etc. 
  It is important today to widen the fields in which satellite 
data are effectively used and to expand the data utilization 
volume. It is necessary to gain a solid recognition of Japan's 
earth observation efforts from not only Japanese people, but 
also from the peoples of the world.
