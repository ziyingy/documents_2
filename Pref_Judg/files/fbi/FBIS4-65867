<F P=106> [Article by John Hibbs: "Labour Aims for Mid-Way Vote </F>
Appeal"] 
  [Text] Action for growth, jobs and investment is Labour's 
priority in its European election manifesto Make Europe Work for 
You. 
  It seeks to position Labour's appeal midway between the 
unconditional federalist aspirations of the Liberal Democrats 
and a divided Tory Party. 
  The document says Labour wants Britain to take a leading 
role 
in re-shaping Europe, making its institutions more accountable. 
Its key proposals are: 
<H5>  ECONOMY </H5>
  A "practical jobs strategy," which acknowledges that growth 
and full employment will only be achieved through sustained 
investment. It calls for: 
  a. Co-ordinated monetary and fiscal policies; 
  b. Better use of the European Investment Bank; Creation of a 
European fund to generate jobs; 
  c. Development of trans-European transport and 
telecommunications networks; d. Incentives to industry to 
increase investment in research and development; implementing 
regulations to bar unfair competition; 
  e. A campaign for greater take-up of European structural 
funds by local authorities in the regions. 
  Labour supports the principle of a managed exchange rate, 
and 
also progress towards economic and monetary union, but makes it 
clear there first has to be convergence of the economic 
performance of member-states. 
<H5>  SOCIAL CHAPTER </H5>
  Labour would immediately sign the Social Chapter of the 
Maastricht Treaty. Meanwhile its MEPs [members of the European 
Parliament] would strive for a guaranteed minimum wage improved 
health and safety at work, the right to belong to a trade union, 
equal opportunities for women, and protection against 
redundancy. 
  While ruling out legislation to enforce a 35-hour week, it 
expects reductions in hours, to share work, subject to agreement 
between employers and staff. It demands greater consultation 
with unions over training, issues relating to multi-national 
companies, full-time and part-time work regulations on young 
workers and environmental measures at work. 
  Sex discrimination legislation should be strengthened, 
giving 
part-time workers the same rights as full-timers. Race 
relations laws should be enforced, outlawing harassment, 
discrimination and racial violence. A commissioner should be 
appointed for racial issues. 
<H5>  COUNTRYSIDE </H5>
  The Common Agricultural Policy should be replaced in 1996 
with a strategy "to reinvigorate the countryside." 
  The manifesto mentions incentives for farmers to manage land 
in socially and environmentally acceptable ways, promoting the 
cultivation of healthy food at prices all can afford, and 
encouraging small producers. 
  Labour wants better conditions for the transport of animals 
an end to cruel battery farming and changes to the Treaty of 
Rome, treating animals as "sentient beings." 
  It backs a joint approach to health promotion, research into 
cures for cancer and Aids, and programmes for tackling drug and 
alcohol abuse. Labour demands a ban on tobacco advertising. 
<H5>  A WIDER EUROPE </H5>
  Aid and trade agreements should help the new democracies of 
eastern Europe offering full membership when they are able to 
bear its responsibilities. 
  Labour backs the harmonisation of migration and asylum 
policies, while maintaining each nation's responsibility for 
implementing the rules. 
  It urges more open decision-making within EC institutions 
and 
greater powers for the Parliament. Qualified majority voting 
should extend to environmental and social affairs, but Britain 
should retain its veto on tax policy foreign affairs and defence 
changes to the Treaty of Rome and "other areas of key national 
interest". 
  European spending should be kept under scrutiny. Increases 
in the European aid budget should not be at the expense of 
Britain's overseas aid programme. International trade 
agreements should include clauses to promote human rights, 
combat child labour and guarantee collective bargaining.
