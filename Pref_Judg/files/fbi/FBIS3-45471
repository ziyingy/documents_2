  [Text] Shanghai, January 15 (CNS) -- Deputy Secretary of 
the Shanghai municipal party committee, Mr. Chen Liangyu, who is 
in charge of organizational and personnel affairs, recently 
revealed that the municipality had now set its goals for 
personnel training beyond the end of this century. 
  According to Mr. Chen, this personnel-training project 
includes 100 high-level party and government leaders, 800 to 
1,000 high-level management personnel and a large batch of 
internationally well-known experts of various kinds. 
  The deputy secretary held that the key to realizing this 
goal 
was the further freeing of people's thinking, the converting of 
their ideas and the selection and promotion of cadres in a bold 
way. The city authorities will create the conditions for these 
people to bring their talents into full play and for them to 
gain experience in various posts at both higher and lower levels.
