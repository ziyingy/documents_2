  [Text] Johannesburg Feb 24 SAPA -- The Democratic Party 
[DP] on Thursday [24 February] condemned incidents leading to 
the shooting of a woman at a National Party rally on Wednesday. 
In a statement, the DP said all political parties had the right 
to campaign where they wanted to. "Establishing no-go zones for 
any political party will make it extremely difficult for the 
elections to be free and fair," the statement said. It called 
on political parties and their leaders to accept the 
responsibility of educating and controlling their supporters. 
The police were also urged to monitor the carrying of weapons 
by supporters and bystanders at campaigns and rallies.
