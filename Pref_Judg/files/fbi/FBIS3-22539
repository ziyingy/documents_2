  [Text] Beijing, January 28 (XINHUA) -- The incidence of 
epidemic diseases decreased steadily in 1993 in the capital city 
of Beijing. 
  Sources disclosed that in 1993 reported cases of contagious 
hepatitis A and B fell by 7.39 percent from that of 1992 and the 
spread of viral hepatitis remained low. 
  The hepatitis B vaccination rate went up during the year, to 
reach 92.80 percent among newborn babies. The hepatitis B 
surface antigen (hbsag) carrying rate was reduced to 0.41 
percent, 87.94 percent down from that over the period 1988-1990. 
  By July 1, 1993, no case of infantile paralysis caused by 
wild strains had been discovered.

million yuan to buy advanced equipment for epidemic prevention 
stations in districts or towns. A computer network has also 
been employed to enable quick reactions to epidemic diseases.
