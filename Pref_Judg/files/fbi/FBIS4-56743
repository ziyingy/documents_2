  [Text] Attention: Tonight, the Constitutional Court 
declared that so-called personal drug doses are not illegal in 
Colombia. For example, arrests such as that of Carlos Sosa, who 
was taken into custody by police for possession of a marijuana 
joint, will no longer occur. From now on, individuals may 
legally possess the following amounts for personal consumption: 
20 grams of marijuana, 1 gram of cocaine, 5 grams of hashish, 
and 4 grams of methacholine (metacualona).
