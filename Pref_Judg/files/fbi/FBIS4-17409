  [Text] St. Petersburg, 23 Apr -- The project to build a 
port in the Ust-Luga firth certainly is in line with Russia's 
national interests and fully meets the economic needs of the 
Russian Federation, said Yevgeniy Fedorov, chairman of the State 
Duma Security Committee, at today's parliamentary hearings in 
St. Petersburg. Leading experts of the State Duma and of the 
Leningrad Oblast government, representatives of design bureaus, 
and environmental and financial organizations took part in these 
hearings on the construction of a major port complex in the 
Russian northeast. 
  Speaking of the economic importance of the new port, experts 
recalled that due to the absence of communications networks 
allowing a quick access to wold markets, $16 billion that could 
be earned through exports are being "mothballed." 
  Ilya Baskin, chairman of the bord of directors of the 
Ust-Luga joint-stock society, told ITAR-TASS that the project's 
total cost is $2 billion and that the port will be built within 
five to six years. He said that the society is now actively 
establishing the environmental monitoring system, building a 
complex of water- cleansing and environmentally safe 
installations, creating a network of mobile facilities for 
industrial waste disposal, and building housing for specialists. 
  The deputies' corps approved, by and large, the project to 
build the port in the Ust-Luga firth of the Gulf of Finland. 
The joint- stock society Ust-Luga has been advised, however, to 
take notice of all possible environmental consequences of this 
human intervention into this region of Russia's maritime 
northwest.
