  [Text] Adolfo Diaz, vice president of the Council of 
Ministers, said that the productive results achieved by the 
cigarette industry is leading it toward stabilization since the 
factories are close to reaching the expected levels for 1994, 
aimed at satisfying the national demand for the product. In an 
extensive communique printed in the TRABAJADORES newspaper, Diaz 
referred to the increased number of smokers among the Cuban 
population and stressed that the stable production and sale of 
cigarettes not only satisfies the consumers' needs, but 
represents a considerable contribution to the national economy, 
which is suffering the consequences of excess currency. Adolfo 
Diaz was hesitant to predict when the sale of cigarettes would 
be released, considering the many factors that would make such a 
prediction inaccurate.
