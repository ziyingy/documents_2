  [Text] Concerning the U.S. State Department's reiteration 
of its one China policy, Presidential Office Spokesman Tai 
Jui-ming pointed out that one China is an unrealized goal 
pursued by our country. China currently consists of two 
political entities. The Republic of China is a sovereign 
country in Taiwan and on Penghu [Pescadores], Chinmen [Quemoy] 
and Matsu islands. There is no question at all on this issue. 
The two sides of the Taiwan Strait are being governed 
separately. The Republic of China and the People's Republic of 
China [zhong hua ren min gong he guo 0022 5478 0086 3046 0364 
0735 0948] are not under the jurisdiction of each other's rule. 
Therefore, when we talk about a unified China, we must not 
forget that a unified China is a goal which is not yet realized. 
It is hoped that the U.S. State Department's policy of 
advocating one China is also a goal. It is hoped that all 
countries in the world will look squarely at this fact.
