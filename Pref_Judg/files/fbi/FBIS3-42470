  [Text] The Vympel Moscow State Machine-Building Design 
Bureau 
(GosMKB), which is entering into an association with 
Spetstekhnika, demonstrated aircraft guided missiles at the 
exhibition for the first time. A comparison of the data reported 
by the KB [Design Bureau] with the specifications of foreign 
missiles indicates that domestically produced missiles, as a 
rule, have somewhat larger dimensions and launch weight but a 
greater launch range, although the numbers clearly characterize 
the maximum unaimed range in the majority of cases. The emphasis 
on the development of medium-range missiles in Russia draws 
attention: the family of R-27 missiles has a large number of 
different variants that are equipped with various homing 
systems, in contrast to similar foreign missiles. A number of 
Russian missiles, especially the latest generation of 
series-produced R-73's and the newly developed RVV-AE 
generation, have substantial design innovations (for example, 
combined aerogasdynamic guidance and latticed control surfaces) 
that permit them to provide heightened maneuvering 
characteristics to missiles in contrast to similar foreign 
missiles. A brief description of Russian missiles with an 
indication of their specific features is cited below. 
  The R-27--is a medium-range aircraft guided 
missile. It is employed from aircraft launcher (APU) and 
catapult (AKU) devices against the following targets: highly 
maneuverable aircraft, helicopters, cruise missiles, etc. 
Destruction of targets is ensured on all aspect angles, during 
the day and at night, in simple and complex weather conditions, 
in the presence of natural or man-made interference, and in the 
background of ground and water surfaces with active 
countermeasures. It has been developed in the following variants: 
  R-27AE--a variant that has inertial guidance with 
radio correction and active radar homing in the terminal phase 
of flight. Independence of operations is ensured within seeker 
lock-on range. The multifunctional monopulse Doppler active 
radar seeker, developed by Agat MNII, provides search, lock-on, 
and tracking of moving targets based on preliminary target 
designation by the radars of the airborne launch platforms or 
antiaircraft systems. The seeker has the following operating 
modes: 

  -  totally autonomous (active) based upon initial target 
designation without the radar support of other radars in 
flight; 
  -  inertial-correcting mode by a radar; 
  -  and, a programmed 
mode under which the user can enter a new program for the 
onboard computer.

  R-27R--a variant that has inertial guidance with 
radio correction and semiactive radar homing in the terminal 
phase of flight. Air Force spokesmen cited a launch range 
equal to 50 km at "Kubinka-92" and the developer's promotional 
materials indicated a range of 80 km at "Mosaeroshow-92" 
(obviously, this is the maximum range of an unaimed launch). The 
9B-1101K inertial-semiactive radar seeker was also developed at 
Agat MNII. The seeker is designed to lock on to targets in 
altitude ranges from 20 to 25 km with a maximum altitude 
separation (vertical separation) of 10 km with target speeds of 
up to 3,500 kph [kilometers per hour] and a G-load of eight. The 
launch of two missiles against two targets is possible. It 
ensures the seeker's readiness for employment one second after 
receipt of the target designation from a MiG-29 type platform's 
weapons control system.

  R-27RE--a modification of the R-27R variant with 
enhanced launch range. It is employed on MiG-29K, MiG-29M, 
MiG-29S, Su-27, Su-27K, and Yak-141 aircraft. 
  R-27T--a variant with all-aspect passive IR 
homing. It is employed based on the "fire and forget" principle. 
The Air Force cited a 45 km launch range at the "Kubinka-92" Air 
Show and the developer's advertising at "Mosaeroshow-92" 
indicated a maximum launch range in the target's forward 
hemisphere of 72 km. A launch weight of 246 kg was cited at 
"Kubinka-92" and 254 kg at "Mosaeroshow-92." 
  R-27TE--a modification of the R-27T variant with 
enhanced launch range. It is utilized on MiG-29K, MiG-29M, 
MiG-29S, Su-27, Su-27K, and Yak-141 aircraft. 
  R-27EM--a variant that has inertial guidance with 
radio correction and semiactive radar homing in the terminal 
phase of flight. It is employed from aircraft launcher and 
catapult devices against the following targets: highly 
maneuverable aircraft, helicopters, Tomahawk cruise missiles, 
and Harpoon-type antiship missiles, etc., at a minimum altitude 
of three meters over water. It ensures destruction of targets in 
all aspect angles, during the day and at night, under simple or 
complex weather conditions, in the presence of natural or 
man-made interference, in the background of ground or water 
surfaces with active maneuvering, jamming, and weapons 
countermeasures. 
  R-33E (AA-9 Amos)--is a long-range aircraft guided 
missile that has inertial guidance and semiactive radar homing 
in the terminal phase of flight. It is employed on the MiG-31 
aircraft from ventral aircraft catapult devices (four missiles 
are suspended) for interception of aircraft and cruise missiles. 
It ensures the destruction of targets that are flying at 
altitudes from 25-50 meters to 26-28 km over various surfaces at 
Mach 3.5 with an altitude separation or vertical separation of 
up to 10 km relative to the launch platform. Destruction of up 
to four targets simultaneously at various altitudes and 
intervals is possible. According to foreign data, the range is 
more than 160 km, although a total of 120 km was indicated at 
"Mosaeroshow-92." 
  R-40T (AA-6 Acrid)--a medium-range aircraft guided 
missile with a TGS [television seeker]. It also has a variant 
with a semiactive radar seeker. Range is approximately 72 km. It 
is utilized on MiG-31, MiG-25, and Su-15 aircraft. 
  R-60 (AA-8 Aphid)--close-range air-to-air missile 
with an infrared seeker. It is utilized on MiG-21, MiG-23M, 
MiG-25PD, MiG-29, MiG-29S, MiG-31, Su-24M, Su-25T, and Yak-38 
aircraft. 
  R-73 (AA-11 Archer)--close-range aircraft guided 
missile. It is utilized on the MiG-21, MiG-23ML, MiG-29, 
MiG-29M, MiG-29S, MiG-29K, Su-27, Su-27K, Su-25T, and Yak-141. 
It has an all-aspect passive IR seeker and combined 
aerogasdynamic guidance. It is employed against the following 
targets: highly maneuverable aircraft, helicopters, cruise 
missiles, etc. It ensures destruction of targets at altitudes of 
up to 5 km in all aspect angles, during the day or at night, 
under simple or complex weather conditions, in the presence of 
natural or man-made interference, and in the background of 
ground or water surfaces. It exceeds existing similar types of 
missiles based on maneuvering characteristics, does not impose 
restrictions on initial launch conditions, and is completely 
autonomous. It has target designation angles of 45Î for the 
RMD1 variant and 60Î for the RMD2 variant. It can serve to 
organize antimissile defense and permits realization of a 
reverse launch mode for defense of the launch platform's rear 
hemisphere. A missile length of 2,100 mm, a maximum launch range 
of 35 km, and a 7.4 kg warhead were indicated at the 
"Kubinka-92" Air Show and the developer cited these somewhat 
different figures for those missile parameters in the RMD1 
variant at "Mosaeroshow-92": 2,900 mm, 30 km, and 8 kg, 
respectively. 
  RVV-AE--A mockup of this medium-range aircraft 
guided missile with an active radar seeker system that is under 
development and which is similar to the American AIM-120 
(AMRAAM) guided missile was displayed at the exhibition. 
Development of the missile has been ongoing for 10 years and it 
should replace existing R-73 missiles. The missile has 
low-aspect-ratio aerodynamic surfaces and four latticed control 
surfaces that are located in the tail section that increase the 
effectiveness of guidance and reduce the missile's RCS. It is 
employed against the following targets: highly maneuverable 
aircraft, cruise missiles, air-to-surface and air-to-air 
missiles, strategic bombers, helicopters, including in the hover 
mode, etc. It ensures destruction of targets from any direction 
in all aspect angles, during the day and at night, under simple 
or complex weather conditions, under conditions of electronic 
countermeasures, and in the background of ground or water 
surfaces based on the "fire and forget" principle, including 
with multichannel fire. In the future, it is envisioned 
configuring the missile with an IR homing warhead with in-flight 
lock-on. They also plan to develop a variant with a motor with 
increased dimensions to increase launch range at low altitudes 
and to destroy AWACS aircraft-type targets at ranges of up to 
150 km or more. It is capable of attacking targets with a side 
angle of 90Î (relative to the launch platform). 
  Tests have been successfully completed and it is proposed 
initiating series production of the missile for installation on 
the Su-27 and MiG-29 aircraft in the near future. Deliveries for 
export are proposed and organization of joint production is 
possible. 
<H5>  Air-to-Surface Guided Missiles and Antiship Missiles </H5>
  Air-to-surface missiles that have been developed at various 
design collectives were displayed in pavilions and on the 
hardstand. 
  The Vympel GOSNKB [State Scientific Design Bureau] displayed 
various variants of the Kh-29 guided missile to destroy hardened 
ground and naval surface targets (steel-reinforced concrete 
shelters, concrete runways, large rail and vehicle bridges, 
ships, and surfaced submarines). The missile is manufactured 
based on a canard design and is equipped with a solid-fuel motor. 
  The Kh-29L guided missile has a semiactive laser 
seeker (illumination of the target from aircraft equipped with 
the Kayra, Klen, or Smerch optical-electronic systems or from 
ground-based laser target designators). Combat employment 
altitude is from 200 meters (maximum launch range of nearly 8 
km) to 5,000 meters (maximum launch range of more than 10 km). 
Minimum launch range is 2-3 km. Seeker lock-on of the 
illuminated target is carried out prior to launch of the guided 
missile. It has a catapult missile launcher. Circular probable 
error when utilizing the Smerch guided missile system for 
missile guidance is 1-2 meters. The Smerch guided missile system 
is employed on the Su-25TK. The use of a helmet-mounted target 
designation system is possible. 
  The Kh-29T guided missile is equipped with a 
television seeker system and is designed to destroy surface 
ships with a displacement of up to 5,000-10,000 tonnes 
(destroyer or cruiser class), steel-reinforced concrete 
shelters, concrete runways, bridges, and industrial facilities. 
Seeker lock-on of the target is carried out prior to launch of 
the guided missile; a depiction of the acquired target is 
reproduced on a television display in the aircraft cockpit, 
after which the missile is fired from the launcher and executes 
an autonomous flight to the target. Maximum launch range 
(depending on the launch platform aircraft's altitude) is 10-12 
km, minimum launch range is 2-3 km, and the launch altitude 
range is 200-5,000 meters. 
  The Kh-29T and Kh-29L guided missiles are equipped 
with 320 kg high-explosive-penetrating warheads and are employed 
from Su-25TK ground attack aircraft, from MiG-23BN, MiG-27K, 
MiG-27M, Su-17M3, Su-17M4, Su-24M and Su-27IB fighter-bombers, 
and from Su-27M and MiG-29M fighter aircraft. 
  During the Iran-Iraq War, Kh-29L guided missiles were 
delivered to Iraq and were successfully employed from MiG-23BN 
and F1E Mirage aircraft with the French ALTIS target designation 
system that is located in a pod (in this case, maximum launch 
range increased to 15 km). 
  The Zvezda Machine-Building Plant displayed a series of 
missiles designed to destroy various land and naval surface 
targets. 
  Kh-25MP antiradiation guided missiles (known in 
the West as the AS-12 Kegler), which are manufactured according 
to a canard design and equipped with a solid fuel motor, are 
designed to destroy enemy radars at a range of up to 40-60 km. 
Hawk surface-to-air missiles and the improved variant are the 
missile's typical targets. Maximum guided missile speed is 900 
meters per second [mps]. 
  The Kh-25L missile has a semiactive laser seeker, 
launch range (depending on the flight altitude of the launch 
platform aircraft) is 10-20 km and maximum speed is 850 mps. A 
variant of the guided missile with a thermal seeker has been 
developed for use at night (maximum launch range is 10-20 km). 
  The Kh-25MR guided missile is equipped with a 
radio command guidance system, attains a maximum speed of 860 
mps, and maximum launch range reaches 10 km. 
  MiG-21, MiG-23, MiG-27, MiG-29, Su-17M, Su-24, Su-25, 
Yak-38, 
and Yak-41M aircraft and also helicopters are equipped with the 
Kh-25M family of missiles. This type of guided missile is 
similar in dimensions, weight, and primary specifications to the 
American-made Hughes AGM-65 Maverick family of guided missiles 
and somewhat exceed the latter in maximum speed. However, a 
thermal seeker that permits effective use of the missile at 
night was introduced earlier on the American guided missiles. 
  The Kh-31A antiship guided missile is equipped 
with a combined solid-fuel/ramjet engine and active radar 
seeker. The missile is manufactured based on a normal 
aerodynamic design with a low-aspect-ratio wing. Four circular 
air intakes covered by cone-shaped protective caps that are 
jettisoned in flight are located along the sides of the fuselage. 
  Based on its primary specifications and design solutions, 
the 
Kh-31A guided missile is close to the Franco-German ANS missile 
which is in the stage of development (however, the domestically 
produced missile has a somewhat greater maximum speed). The 
guided missile is capable of destroying targets when jamming is 
being used. 
  MiG-29M, MiG-29K (an aircraft with a guided missile was 
displayed on the hardstand), MiG-27K (an aircraft with a guided 
missile was displayed on the hardstand), Su-27M, SU-27IB, 
Yak-41M, and also helicopters are armed (or are proposed to be 
armed) with this missile. 
  According to the developing firm, at the present time the 
Kh-31P antiradiation guided missile is the best 
missile of its class in the world. The guided missile is capable 
of effectively destroying all existing types of air defense 
medium- and long-range surface-to-air missile radars (including 
the best American Patriot surface-to-air missile system) and 
also early warning and air traffic control radars. The firm 
states that the Kh-31P exceeds the American AGM-88 HARM guided 
missile and the French ARMAT in its combat specifications. 
MiG-21 and MiG-23BN (after completion of modernization work), 
MiG-27M, MiG-29M, MiG-29K, Su-24M, Su-27M, Su-27IB, and Yak-41M 
aircraft are platforms for this missile. Structurally, the 
Kh-31P is similar to the Kh-31A and differences consist of the 
guidance system and less powerful warhead. The maximum speed of 
the Kh-31 missile family is 1,000 mps. The developing firm 
states that the combat capabilities of aircraft should increase 
by a factor of 3-5 after they have been armed with its family of 
missiles. 
  The Kh-35 guided missile (Western 
designation--SS-N-25) is a missile with transonic speed (300 
mps) and is equipped with a turbojet bypass sustainer engine. 
Its development began in 1983 based on a Navy order which was 
interested in an antiship missile to arm light ships (craft) and 
aircraft. The entry of the aircraft variant of the missile into 
the inventory of the CIS countries' air forces and navies is 
anticipated in 1994. 
  The guided missile is manufactured based on a normal 
aerodynamic design and has a folding wing and tail assembly. A 
trapezoidal air intake is located in the lower portion of the 
fuselage. A variant of the missile that is designed for launch 
from ships, ground-based launchers, and helicopters is equipped 
with a solid fuel rocket booster engine and has a 
high-aspect-ratio folding cruciform tail assembly. It has an 
active radar guidance system on the terminal phase of the 
trajectory that is capable of operating under conditions of 
electronic countermeasures. The missile's combat effectiveness 
increases due to flight at extremely low altitudes (3-5 meters 
depending on the height of the waves) which significantly 
complicates interception of the guided missile by shipborne 
antimissile systems. The missile is equipped with a 145 kg 
high-explosive-fragmentation-incendiary warhead armed with high 
explosives. 
  After appropriate refitting, practically all types of 
tactical aircraft (including the MiG-21, which is capable of 
carrying one Kh-35 guided missile on a ventral hard point), the 
Tu-142 antisubmarine warfare aircraft (eight missiles located on 
two underwing hard points), and also the Ka-27 and Ka-28 
helicopters can be launch platforms for the aircraft variant of 
the missile (without the booster rocket). The shipborne variant 
of the guided missile, which is part of the Uran system, is 
accommodated in transport-launch canisters, grouped in packages 
of four each, on missile boats and small missile ships and also 
on ships of other classes (SKR's [escort vessels] and BPK's 
[large antisubmarine warfare ships]) during the course of their 
modernization. 
  A drawing of a coastal defense system using Kh-35 guided 
missiles was displayed at the exhibition. The self-propelled 
system, mounted on a four-axle off-road chassis, includes a 
command and control and communications vehicle equipped with a 
radar on a mobile mast, a launcher with eight transport-launch 
canisters, and also a transloader [transporter-loader] vehicle 
that carries eight transport-launch canisters and a crane. 
Launch of the coastal variant of the Kh-35 can also be 
accomplished from closed positions. 
  Based on its design solutions and tactical-technical 
specifications, the Kh-35 missile is close to the American 
AGM/RGM-84 Harpoon antiship guided missile, however, according 
to the developing firm's statement, it somewhat exceeds the 
latter in combat effectiveness (the Kh-35 has a somewhat greater 
launch range and weighs 80 kg less). 
  Information on a future antiship missile in the stage of 
development at the present time was presented at the Almaz NPO 
[Scientific Production Association] Pavilion. The all-weather 
supersonic missile is designed to destroy hardened single or 
group naval surface targets and is equipped with a solid-fuel 
rocket motor. A launch is conducted from a transport-launch 
canister at angles of 19-90Î (depending on the type of 
launch platforms). Maximum launch range is 250 km. It is 
proposed using future nuclear submarines and also reequipped 
nuclear submarines of old designs as missile launch platforms 
(the capability to install a package of several missiles in SLBM 
[submarine-launched ballistic missile] launch tubes is 
envisioned). Furthermore, it is planned to arm surface 
combatants of various classes (destroyers, cruisers) and also 
ground-based self-propelled coastal defense mounts (the 
installation of three missiles launched at a slant on one 
four-axle off-road motor vehicle is envisioned) with the new 
guided missile. 
  A Moskvit supersonic heavy antiship missile designed to 
destroy major surface targets was suspended on a ventral 
hardpoint on a special pylon under a Su-27K aircraft displayed 
on the exhibition's hardstand. The missile's length is 9.7 m, 
launch weight is 4,500 kg, launch range is 150-250 km (depending 
on the flight altitude of the missile launch platform aircraft), 
and it has a 320 kg warhead. The guided missile is equipped with 
a combined solid-fuel ramjet engine, has four semicircular air 
intakes with a central cone, a folding wing, and 
low-aspect-ratio tail assembly. Utilization of both passive and 
active homing systems is possible. 
  Sovremennyy class destroyers (eight launchers), missile 
boats 
(four launchers), Sivuch class hydrofoils (eight launchers), and 
also wing-in-ground effect vehicles are equipped with the 
shipborne variant of this missile (known in the West as the 
SS-N-22). 
  Information on the state of work on the future aircraft 
guided missile was reported to journalists during the course of 
the exhibition's operation. 
  FLIGHT INTERNATIONAL magazine reported on the cessation of 
work, for financial considerations, on the program to develop an 
improved, strategic, supersonic, stealth cruise missile, which 
is known in the West as the AS-19. The development of this 
missile, which is designed to equip the Tu-160 and Tu-95MS 
bombers, was begin in the mid-1980's and its entry into the 
inventory was planned for the mid-1990's. The missile was 
designed to replace the RKV-15B cruise missile (AS-15). The 
cruise missile has a maximum launch range of approximately 4,000 
km and carries two warheads with independent guidance that are 
capable of detecting and attacking targets up to 100 km from 
each other. The conduct of the cruise missile program's flight 
tests has been impeded for political reasons (the test ranges 
where the launches are being conducted are located on the 
territory of the Republic of Kazakhstan). 
  A hypersonic aeroballistic antiship missile (a modification 
of the RKV-500B short-range nuclear aircraft missile known in 
the West as the AS-16 Kickback) has a launch weight of 1,200 kg 
and is externally similar to the American AGM-69 SRAM aircraft 
missile with which American B-52, B-1B, and B-2 bombers are 
armed. The antiship missile can be mounted on Tu-160 and Tu-22M 
bomber drum launchers. The missile is equipped with an inertial 
guidance system that is used on the cruise portion of the 
trajectory and an active radar seeker that operates in the 
millimeter band. The launch range of the antiship missile is 
60-150 km. After launch, the missile carries out a supersonic 
cruising flight using aerodynamic lift and, in the terminal 
phase, moves along a ballistic trajectory with a speed 
equivalent to Mach 5. 
  A subsonic medium-range antiship missile known in the West 
as 
the AS-18 can be accommodated both on ships and on aircraft. The 
antiship missile is 5 meters long, is manufactured based on a 
canard design with a cruciform wing and tail assembly, is 
equipped with a solid-fuel rocket engine installed in a pod 
under the fuselage, and has a 315-kg warhead and a maximum 
launch range of 200 km. The guidance system is inertial for the

<H5>  Antisubmarine Warfare Weapons </H5>
  Several guided aircraft weapons systems that have no equals 
in the navies of foreign countries were displayed at the 
exhibition. 
  A mock-up of the APR-2Ye aircraft antisubmarine solid-fuel 
missile torpedo developed by the Region GNPP [State Scientific 
Production Association] and designed to destroy submarines 
moving at speeds of up to 80 kph (43 knots) at a depth of up to 
600 meters (the future American Seawolf nuclear submarine under 
construction at the present time should have a maximum speed of 
35 knots and a maximum depth of up to 500 meters) was 
demonstrated on a stand. The missile's guidance system is 
hydroacoustic with phase correlation. Target lock-on range is 
1,500 meters, space surveillance sector by the guidance system 
is 90 x 45Î. The probability of destruction of a submarine 
at a depth of 300-500 meters is 70-85%. The guided 
missile is 
dropped from a helicopter, after which the missile begins a 
target search in the autonomous mode, and time of completion of 
the combat mission is 1-2 minutes. 
  The system includes the AKIP-1Ye automatic verification 
unit, 
a PA-2 training missile-torpedo, and an A4 simulator that 
ensures rehearsal of the combat mission without dropping the 
missile-torpedo. 
  The SZV guided depth bomb is designed to destroy modern and 
future submarines from periscope depth to 600 meters. The small 
munition does not have a power plant and it is planned to use 
hydrodynamic force at an angle of 60Î. The depth bomb's 
trajectory can be changed within 120Î. It has an active 
hydroacoustic guidance system. The probability of destruction of 
a submarine increased by a factor of 1.2-1.5 in contrast to 
depth bombs at depths of up to 200 meters, and by a factor of up 
to 4-8 at depths of 200-600 meters. A 19 kg shaped warhead has 
been employed on the depth bomb. 
  A full-scale mockup of the Zapad rocket-propelled guided 
bomb 
designed for use with a standard shipborne RBU-6000 which was 
developed for firing unguided rocket-propelled depth bombs and 
installed on many domestically produced and foreign combat ships 
was demonstrated. 
  The bomb has a hydroacoustic guidance system (submarine 
detection range--130 meters) and can be employed at distances of 
600-4,300 meters, the sailing depth of the submarine being fired 
at can reach 1,000 meters and the probability of its destruction 
is 0.8.

  The munitions presented at the exhibition are distinguished 
by their relative simplicity of design and low cost, they can be 
used from various classes of ships and aircraft, and at the same 
time they approximate significantly more complex Western systems 
in combat effectiveness. 
<H5>  Guided Aircraft Bombs </H5>
  At the present time, guided bombs are one of the most 
effective types of aircraft weaponry, combining high destruction 
accuracy with the relatively low cost of the munition. 
  Materials on KAB-500Kr and KAB-1500 bombs that have 
television and laser guidance, respectively, were presented at 
the exhibition. The KAB-500Kr bomb is designed to destroy fixed 
ground-based targets (rail bridges and fortified transportation 
hubs during the day under good weather conditions). The 
correlational type television guidance system provides the 
capability to destroy camouflaged targets. In contrast to other 
types of guided aircraft bombs, specifically, the American 
Walleye bombs that lock on to an optically contrasting target, 
the KAB-500Kr's seeker head records the relative position of 
various optically contrasting objects and in the process the 
target itself does not have to be separated from the background 
of the terrain and the munition will be guided to an arbitrary 
point assigned by a marker. 
  After release from the aircraft, the bomb is completely 
autonomous and requires correction and the circular probable 
error is 4-7 meters. The munition is equipped with a 380 kg 
armor-piercing warhead that is designed to destroy 
well-fortified targets (there is also a variant with a 
high-explosive warhead that ensures a destruction area of 1,500 
m[.sup]2[/]. The range of speeds of the aircraft-platforms 
during release of the munition is 550-1,100 kph and the range of 
release altitudes is 500-5,000 meters. 
  The KAB-500Kr-U training munition, which permits simulation 
of the entire bombing cycle and records its results without an 
actual bomb drop (the KAB-500Kr-U is a nondroppable canister 
weighing 85 kg, is 1,830 mm long and 350 mm in diameter, and is 
equipped with a television system similar to the one installed 
on the KAB-500Kr bomb that is attached to the aircraft's 
external hardpoints), has been developed to rehearse combat 
employment of the KAB-500Kr. 
  The KAB-1500-L-Pr powerful guided bomb is designed to equip 
frontal and long-range aviation aircraft. Its targets are small, 
super-hardened facilities or facilities that are buried deep in 
the earth (powerful fortifications, nuclear munitions dumps, 
strategic command posts). 
  The munition consists of a semiactive laser seeker that 
ensures a circular probable error of 7-10 meters (up to 1-2 
meters on the latest modifications) and is manufactured 
according to a canard design. A cruciform wing with deployable 
outboard wings is located in the tail section, behind which are 
biplane control surfaces that ensure high maneuvering 
characteristics. A special subcaliber armor-piercing incendiary 
warhead is utilized in the bomb that is capable of penetrating 
10-20 meters into the ground and piercing the covers of 
fortifications up to 2 meters thick. 
  The KAB-1500L-F munition is equipped with a warhead that is 
utilized in the FAB-1500 standard free-fall bomb (upon 
detonation, a 20 meter diameter crater is formed) and is similar 
to the KAB-1500L-Pr bomb in the remainder. The KAB-1500L-Pr 
bomb's range of combat employment altitudes realized during 
utilization of the munition from frontal aviation aircraft is 
500-5,000 meters (KAB-1500L-F--1,000-5,000 meters) at bombing 
speeds of 550-1,100 kph (expansion of these parameters is 
possible in the future). 
  In April 1992, a KAB-500L bomb with a laser guidance system 
and high-explosive warhead was displayed at the "Kubinka-92" Air 
Show.

  The Impuls State Scientific Production Association presented 
information on a television seeker for various types of guided 
aircraft bombs. The television seeker is designed for use in 250 
to 4,000 kg precision guided munitions with target lock-on prior 
to launch. The munitions can be utilized from both domestically 
produced and foreign aircraft (specifically, from Mirage and 
SEPECAT Jaguar fighter aircraft). Target selection and lock-on 
is carried out using a television display in the 
weapons-carrying aircraft cockpit. 
  The television seeker ensures precision guidance of the bomb 
against small targets such as cruise missile and mobile 
surface-to-air missile [SAM] launchers, command and control 
centers, ships, bridges, etc. The television seeker has been 
successfully tested in a combat situation. Based on a customer's 
requirement, it can be modernized for a specific type of 
aircraft and manufactured based on a buyer's product base.

  Domestically produced guided aircraft bombs with television 
and laser systems do not lag behind similar American munitions 
based upon primary specifications, however, a certain lag has 
been observed in guided aircraft bombs that are equipped with 
infrared imaging guidance systems (no munitions with an IR 
guidance system were displayed at the exhibition). 
<H5>  Unguided Aircraft Rockets </H5>
  Various types of unguided aircraft rockets and pods for them 
that are designed for installation on various types of combat 
aircraft and helicopters were demonstrated at pavilions and on 
hardstands. 
  The S-8 (80 mm) aircraft rocket system, with which the 
Su-17M, Su-24, Su-25, Su-27, MiG-23, and MiG-27 aircraft and 
also the Mi-8, Mi-24, Mi-28, and Ka-25 helicopters are equipped, 
was displayed along with the widely known S-5 57 mm unguided 
aircraft rockets. B-8M1 launch pods that are designed for 20 
rockets (length--3,550 mm, diameter--410 mm, empty weight--160 
kg, loaded weight--400 kg) and have improved aerodynamics with a 
conical nose section are used to launch them from aircraft. 
B-8V20 pods that also have a 20 rocket capacity (length 1,790 
mm, diameter--521 mm, empty weight--100 kg, and loaded 
weight--342 kg) are used on helicopters. 
  The rocket is equipped with a solid-fuel motor and has 
various warhead configurations.

  The S-13 122 mm unguided aircraft rocket launched from the 
B-13 launch pod with a five rocket capacity is another powerful 
rocket that was displayed at the exhibition. Su-27 and MiG-29 
fighter aircraft, Su-25 ground attack aircraft, and also the 
future Su-37 strike aircraft are equipped with this type of pod 
(weight of empty pod--160 kg, weight of loaded pod--510 kg, 
length--3,558 mm, and diameter--410 mm). 
  S-24 and S-25 large caliber unguided aircraft rockets are 
launched from identical launchers and there are no similar 
foreign rockets at the present time. A variant of the S-25 
rocket with a semiactive laser guidance system was demonstrated 
at the exhibition.

  Gun mounts that are designed for suspension on various types 
of combat aircraft and helicopters were demonstrated at the 
exhibition's pavilions. The mobile gun-cannon mounts 
manufactured by MMPP have a remote control system in one or two 
planes with an electric drive and selsyn communications with a 
target assigning device. They are designed to destroy point and 
lengthy, lightly defended targets and also airborne targets 
using 7.62 to 23 mm guns with a basic load that is sufficient to 
accomplish several attacks. The mounts function without recoil 
at temperatures from -60 to +60 ÎC and at altitudes up to 
15,000 m, are simple to operate, reliable, and require minimum 
time to prepare for use. The pod mounts can be hung on aircraft 
and helicopters that have third group beam brackets (up to a 500 
kg capacity). 
  The SPPU-6 removable gun mount is armed with a 9A-620 or 
9A-768 23 mm six-barrel gun with a rate of fire of 9,000-10,000 
rounds per minute. The gun can be aimed in the vertical plane to 
8Î. Guidance along the azimuth (to an angle of up to 
12Î) is provided by rotating the entire canister around the 
longitudinal axis. The SPPU-6 pod is designed for installation 
on two-seat combat aircraft (specifically, the Su-27UB) and the 
second crew member carries out aiming. The SPPU-6 weighs 525 kg, 
is 5 meters long, 0.5 meters in diameter, and the basic load is 
400 rounds. 
  The UAK-23-250 pod with the GSh-23 (23 mm) gun can be 
attached to the external hard points of various types of 
aircraft or helicopters. The pod is 3,166 mm long, 340 mm in 
diameter, weighs 217 kg, and has a basic load of 250 rounds. 
  The SPPU-1 pod, also armed with a GSh-23 gun with a 3,400 
rounds per minute rate of fire, has a system to divert the gun's 
barrels 30Î below which provides the capability to conduct 
fire against ground-based targets in horizontal flight. The 
pod's basic load is 260 rounds and it weighs 290 kg. 
  The GUV universal helicopter pod can be equipped with one 
YaKB-12.7 (12.7 mm) machine gun or two GShG's. The basic load is 
4,350 rounds, dimensions 3,000 x 480 mm, empty weight--140 kg, 
loaded weight--452 kg. 
  The NUV-1UM machine gun turret mount with remote control is 
armed with a 9A-622 four-barrel machine gun (7.62 mm, 6,000 
round per minute rate of fire). Angles of vertical laying are 
0-30Î, horizontal -30-+28Î. Weight of the mount is 27 kg 
and, in particular, the Ka-29 helicopter is armed with it. 
  A removable, mobile gun mount for firing at ground-based and 
airborne targets equipped with a GSh-30-1 gun (30 mm, 1,500 
rounds per minute) aimed in the horizontal plane to -15-+15Î 
and to 0-30Î in the vertical was demonstrated on the 
Dzerzhinets MAZ hardstand. It has an electric remote control 
servo aiming drive. The system's basic load is 150 rounds, 
weight--480 kg, dimensions--3,030 x 540 x 550 mm. The mount can 
be hung on a beam bracket or can be attached directly to the 
aircraft airframe. The SPPU is designed to equip Su-25 ground 
attack aircraft and is undergoing testing at the present time.

  The division that reflects work in the sphere of developing 
antiaircraft weapons was one of the most represented at the 
exhibition. Many promising SAM systems that are being prepared 
for acceptance into the inventories of the CIS countries troops 
were demonstrated here. 
  The Antey Concern displayed the S-300V Mobile SAM System 
(known in the West under the designation SA-12A/SA-12B), which 
is designed for defense of troop formations and the front's most 
important facilities from tactical or operational-tactical 
ballistic missiles, and also from aircraft, cruise missiles, and 
UAV's [unmanned aerial vehicles]. The system has high 
jam-proofing and is capable of simultaneously firing at up to 24 
targets with guidance of up to two missiles from one launcher or 
up to four missiles from two launchers against each target. The 
entire combat operations process has been automated to the 
maximum extent possible thanks to the use of high-speed digital 
computers. 
  The SAM system (up to four units) and the detection and 
target designation unit are part of the system's combat 
components that are entirely mounted on off-road tracked chassis 
and are equipped with protective devices from the destructive 
factors of nuclear weapons. The latter includes a command post, 
a 360Î surveillance radar, and a sector surveillance radar 
(all the radars have phased array antennas). Each SAM unit 
consists of multichannel missile guidance equipment and six 
launchers of two types: type 1 for two long-range missiles that 
are designed to intercept Pershing class intermediate-range 
ballistic missiles and type 2 for four lesser-range missiles 
that are designed to intercept Lance/Scud class short-range 
ballistic missiles. 
  Type 1 missiles are equipped with an additional solid-fuel 
booster which provides them with a flight speed of up to 2,400 
mps and a maximum guaranteed target destruction range of up to 
100 km (during tests, an aerodynamic target was intercepted at a 
range of 204 km). The single-stage type 2 missile attains a 
maximum speed of 1,700 mps. The remaining portions of the type 1 
and type 2 missiles have been standardized to the maximum 
possible degree. The fuselage is nearly a conical shape (similar 
to Spirit and Arrow antimissile fuselages) and is equipped with 
a radar translucent nose fairing that is capable of withstanding 
dynamic head and kinetic heating at speeds that correspond to 
Mach 6.5. It has a combined guidance system: inertial--in the 
cruise phase of the trajectory and semiactive radar--in the 
terminal phase. Target illumination is carried out using a 
special radar with round antennas that are mounted on each 
launcher and are raised up on special masts that permits it to 
conduct fire from positions in a city, forest, or rugged terrain. 
  Using the S-300V system, you can intercept targets with an 
RCS of approximately 0.02 m[.sup]2[/], which permits you to 
combat small cruise missiles and aircraft manufactured using 
Stealth technology (according to the assessments of American 
experts, the minimum RCS in a course projection of the B-2 
stealth bomber is 0.02-0.05 m[.sup]2[/] and the RCS of the 
F-117A and F-22 aircraft is somewhat greater). Lock-on and 
automatic tracking of MIRV'ed targets (specifically, of 
ballistic missile warheads) is possible. 
  The missile is equipped with a directed energy warhead 
(before detonation of the warhead, the missile is oriented in a 
bank in the appropriate manner). The fuze has two positions: for 
operations against aerodynamic targets (destruction of aircraft 
in the central section); for operations against ballistic 
missiles (destruction of the warhead).

  The S-300V system has been accepted into the Russian ground 
forces inventory and is being series produced (the combat 
vehicles that were displayed at the exhibition are part of a 
system that arrived from a line unit where they performed combat 
alert duty). 
  Based on its combat capabilities the S-300V system has no 
equals in the world at the present time. Systems with 
specifications that approximate the specifications of the 
domestically produced system are being developed abroad within 
the framework of the American SDI Program and are only in the 
developmental stage. 
  Israel, jointly with the United States, is developing the 
Arrow Regional Antiballistic Missile [ABM] Defense System that 
is closest in capabilities to the S-300V SAM System, which they 
plan to accept into their inventory at the end of the 1990's. In 
the United States, work is being conducted on the LEDI (Low 
Endoatmospheric Defense Interceptor) Tactical ABM System. 
Furthermore, modernization of the Patriot MIM-104 SAM System is 
being conducted within the framework of the PAC (Patriot 
Antitactical Missile Capability) program directed at increasing 
its capabilities to combat ballistic missiles (missiles 
modernized during the course of the first stage of this program 
participated in combat operations in the Persian Gulf region in 
the winter of 1991). Comparative specifications of the 
antimissile capabilities of the S-300V SAM and future foreign 
antimissile systems are cited in the table.

  The Tor All-Weather SAM System (known in the West as the 
SA-15) was developed by Antey Concern and is designed to 
accomplish air defense missions at the battalion level. The 
system will permit them to provide effective defense of 
facilities from surprise strikes of guided missiles, guided 
bombs, aircraft, helicopters, and UAV's. 
  The system with a transported basic load (eight missiles in 
vertical armored launchers) is mounted on a single armored 
tracked chassis that has adjustable clearance and can be 
transported by all types of transportation, including aircraft 
(chassis weight is 34,250 kg, maximum speed along hard-surfaced 
roads is 65 kph). The crew consists of the commander, operator, 
and driver-mechanic. 
  The system is equipped with a C-band Doppler surveillance 
radar capable of detecting targets while moving (detection 
range--up to 25 km, number of simultaneously detected 
targets--48, number of track-while-scan targets--10). The 
assessment of the degree of threat and selection of priority 
targets are conducted automatically. The radar antenna folds in 
the travel position. The Doppler fire control radar with a 
phased array antenna that operates in the K-band is capable of 
simultaneously identifying and tracking up to two targets within 
a 15 x 15Î operating sector. The system also has an optical 
detection and sighting device (detection range of a typical 
target--20 km). Two targets can be fired at simultaneously. 
  The 9M330 single-stage solid-fuel missile with a radio 
command guidance system that is part of the Tor system is 
manufactured according to a canard design and is equipped with a 
folding wing and tail assembly. It is transported and stored in 
transport-launch canisters (four missiles in each). 
  The launch of the guided missile is carried out vertically 
from a canister using a catapult. Turning the missile onto the 
combat course after it leaves the launcher is carried out using 
gas control surfaces in the missile's nose section. The 
missile's maximum speed is 850 mps and the maximum maneuverable 
G-load is 30. 
  A special transloader vehicle (TZM) is utilized to transport 
an additional basic load of missiles and the loading device. A 
simulator has been provided to train system operators.

  During the exhibition it was reported that approximately 200 
Tor SAM Systems have been delivered to the troops of the CIS 
countries. The Tor systems are replacing the Osa 9K33 Battalion 
Element Mobile SAM System which is widely used in CIS countries 
armed forces and which was supplied to other countries. 
According to data that has not been confirmed by the American 
side, an F-117A stealth aircraft was shot down by an Iraqi Osa 
SAM System during the course of military operations in the 
Persian Gulf region. One of the latest modifications of this 
system--the Osa-AK 9K33M3 SAM System--has the following 
specifications: detection range of a typical target--28 km, 
target altitude range--25-6,000 m, minimum range--1,500 m, 
maximum range--10,000 m, maximum target speed at an altitude of 
more than 100 m--500 mps, kill probability--0.4-0.94. The SAM 
system is mounted on a BAZ 3937 amphibious off-road three-axle 
chassis. 
  The Ulyanovsk Mechanical Plant presented the Gang SAM System 
(export variant of the Buk Tactical SAM System or SA-11) that is 
designed to destroy high-speed maneuvering aerodynamic targets, 
aircraft-projectiles, and cruise missiles under conditions of a 
massive air raid and intense enemy electronic countermeasures 
and also fire support helicopters, including those hovering at 
extremely low altitudes. The target guaranteed kill zone is 
15-22,000 meters in altitude and 3,000-32,000 meters in range. 
Maximum speed of approaching targets can reach 830 mps, of 
targets moving away--300 mps. The system supports simultaneous 
firing against up to six targets that are flying from any 
direction at various altitudes. The target kill probability is 
0.7-0.9. 
  The system's combat elements include a command post (KP), a 
target detection station (SOTs), six self-propelled launchers, 
and six launcher-reloaders (all--on armored off-road tracked 
chassis that weigh 30-35 tonnes, have a maximum highway speed of 
65 kph and a range of 500 km). Equipment includes a vehicle and 
maintenance shop, mobile automated monitoring-test equipment to 
inspect the surface-to-air missiles, three repair and 
maintenance vehicles, a SAM transport vehicle, a compressor and 
a truck crane (all--on ZiL-131, Ural-43202, or KrAZ-255B 
off-road truck chassis). 
  The SAM system command post has an information depiction 
system, a digital computer, communications encoding equipment, a 
data transmission device, an internal telephone communications 
and switching system, a speech communications system, navigation 
equipment, documentation and simulation equipment, and an 
independent electrical power source. Habitation conditions 
permit a crew to operate continuously for a 24-hour period. 
  The command post is capable of simultaneously processing 
information on 75 targets and simultaneously tracking 15 tracks 
in the automatic mode. The target detection station, equipped 
with a radar with a folding phased array antenna, ensures 
detection of airborne targets, identification of friend or foe

  The self-propelled gun mount is capable of operating both as 
part of the SAM system based on target designation data and also 
in the independent mode in a previously assigned sector of 
responsibility. Firing against airborne targets can be conducted 
both from the mount itself and also from the PZU 
[launcher-reloader] assigned to it, which significantly 
increases the system's combat capabilities. 
  The SPU [self-propelled launcher] consists of the fire 
control radar with a jam-proof system, a radar interrogator, 
command and control and information processing equipment, data 
transmission equipment, navigation equipment, a speech and 
intercom system, and also an independent electrical power source.

  In the event that its own radar malfunctions, the SOU 
[self-propelled gun mount] can be utilized in the firing mode 
with target illumination by another SOU. 
  There are four missiles on a self-propelled launcher which 
are launched at an angle. The weight of the self-propelled 
launcher is 32,340 kg and set up/tear down time is five minutes. 
  The launcher-loader is designed to launch, transport, and 
store missiles and also to conduct loading and unloading work. 
It consists of an internal intercom and switching equipment, a 
speech communications and telecode communications system, a 
load-lifting device, an analog computer, navigation equipment, 
documentation equipment, and an electro-hydraulic servo drive. 
  Four missiles are transported on launchers and can be 
launched and another four missiles are carried under them on 
transport brackets. Self-loading time for the launcher-loader 
with four missiles that are on the transport brackets is 15 
minutes and loading time of the self-propelled gun mount is 13 
minutes. 
  The 9M38M1E single-stage SAM is manufactured according to a 
normal aerodynamic design with a low-aspect-ratio wing and has 
semiactive radar guidance, an autopilot, a radar fuze, a system 
of contact sensors, electrical equipment with a turbogenerator 
power source, a control surface gas feed system with a gas 
generator, and a solid-fuel engine.

  The Gang SAM System's distinctive features include its high 
mobility and combat survivability. 
  The Fakel MKB, headed by Academician P. Grushin until 1991 
(V. Svetlov heads the MKB at the present time), presented 
information on the S-200DE (SA-5) and S-300PMU (SA-10) SAM 
Systems and the future S-300PMU-1 SAM System that has been 
developed for a PVO [air defense] system. 
  The country's PVO troops cover more than 400 economic and 
military targets on the territory of Russia (including more than 
100 strategic targets) from the potential enemy's strategic 
offensive forces' air strikes. Sixty-five percent of the air 
defense weapons that previously belonged to the USSR are 
concentrated in Russia. 
  The S-200 SAM System was developed at the end of the 1960's 
to destroy aircraft, first of all strategic bombers. The 
experience of the combat employment of the S-75 SAM System in 
Vietnam was widely utilized during development of the system. 
The S-200 SAM System was supplied to Syria and employed in 
combat operations during the winter of 1982-1983 against Israeli 
and American aircraft (they were serviced by Soviet crews). In 
1986, a S-200 SAM System that was serviced by Libyans 
participated in repelling an air raid by American aircraft 
against Tripoli, during the course of which the United States 
lost an F-111 fighter-bomber and, according to Libyan 
information, several other carrier-based aircraft. 
  The missiles that are part of the S-200DE SAM System have a 
semiactive radar guidance system. A battalion has 12 
restrictedly mobile launchers, and missile firing preparation 
time is 1.5 seconds. The maximum guaranteed target kill range of 
a strategic bomber/AWACS aircraft/jammer aircraft is 300 km, the 
altitude ranges of intercepted targets--300-35,000 meters, and 
maximum target speed is 4,300 kph. 
  The S-300PMU Multichannel Mobile SAM System was accepted 
into 
the inventory in the mid-1980's and is designed to destroy enemy 
aircraft, helicopters, cruise missiles, and ballistic missiles 
at a great distance in a broad range of altitudes. The system 
consists of a command post, radar (mounted on MAZ off-road 
four-axle chassis), and 12 self-propelled launchers (each 
carries four missiles in a TPU [launcher-transporter]). The 
self-propelled launcher is manufactured in two modifications: 
5P85TE--trailer on a KrAZ three-axle truck and 5P85SE--on a MAZ 
four-axle truck. 
  The 48N6Ye single-stage solid-fuel guided missile has a 
guidance system that is similar to the one employed in the 
Patriot MIM-104 SAM. Maximum guaranteed target destruction range 
is 90 km, and the range of destruction altitudes is 25-25,000 
meters. The missile is launched vertically from a 
transport-launch canister (TPK) using a catapult and after 
launch the engine is canted by gas control surfaces-ailerons in 
any required direction depending on the position of the target. 
  The guided missile was developed based on the concept of 
guaranteed reliability, is operated in a sealed transport-launch 
canister, and does not require inspection or adjustment during 
the entire period of service. 
  The fire control radar is equipped with a phased antenna 
array with a digital beam control system that has a 
multiprocessor computer. During deployment in a city, forest, or 
rugged terrain, the radar can be raised to a great height using 
a special lift device that is transported on a separate trailer. 
  The SAM system can operate both in the air defense system 
radar target designation receipt mode and independently (in this 
case, it includes a 360Î surveillance radar that is capable 
of detecting low-flying targets and is raised to a height of 
several dozen meters on a special pole). 
  System deployment and teardown time is five minutes and the 
rate of fire is five seconds. Twelve missiles can be fired 
simultaneously against six targets. 
  The future S-300PMU-1 SAM System which they plan to accept 
into the Russian PVO Troops inventory in 1993 was displayed at 
the exhibition. In contrast to the S-300PMU System, the new SAM 
system has an expanded range of speeds of destroyed targets 
(aircraft flying at speeds of up to 6,450 kph can be 
intercepted), the radar surveillance sector has been increased, 
and the maximum guaranteed kill range for aerodynamic targets 
has been increased to 150 km, for ballistic missiles--to 40 km. 
  There is a built-in simulator to train the SAM system's 
crews.

  The 9A35M3 Strela-10M3 (Western designation SA-13) Light SAM 
System is designed for direct cover of troops on the battlefield 
and on the march from low-flying aircraft and helicopters, and 
also for destruction of cruise missiles and UAV's. 
  The SAM system mounted on an MTLB tracked armored chassis 
includes: 

  -  a 9S86 zone assessment device (AOZ) that is designed for 
automatic determination of the position of the target relative 
to the borders of the missile launch zone (in a range of 
450-10,000 m) and calculation of the angles of a prohibited 
launch that are worked out by the launcher prior to missile 
launch; 
  -  a 9S16 passive direction finder (PRP) designed to detect 
and get an accurate bearing on airborne targets that are flying 
with turned-on onboard pulse radiotechnical systems (a 360Î 
surveillance sector along the azimuth and an elevation of 
40Î); 
  -  an 1RL246-10-2 ground-based radio interrogator (NRZ) 
that is designed to determine whether an airborne target is 
friend or foe at a range of up to 12,000 meters and altitudes of 
25-5,000 meters; 
  -  a 9V179-1 reception and target designation 
device (APTs) and a 9V180 target designation realization device 
(ARTs) that is designed for centralized command and control of 
the combat operation of the systems from mobile command and 
control facilities that are equipped with a standardized data 
transmission device (ASPD-U); 
  -  a 9V38M3 projectile launch device 
(AZS) that serves for prelaunch preparation of missiles in the 
manual and automatic mode of switching posts (emergency missile 
launch and the capability to train crews with monitoring of 
operator actions has been provided for. Sound and light signals 
are given to the operator as an indication of fulfillment of 
operations during combat work). 

    Four missiles ready for combat are on the launcher in 
transport-launch canisters and another four SAM's are carried in 
the combat vehicle. The missile operates in the autonomous mode, 
guiding itself according to photo contrast or target IR 
radiation. Firing is conducted in place or at short halts. The 
crew consists of a commander, an operator, and a 
driver-mechanic. An RPK (7.62 mm) machine gun is attached to the 
saddle in front of the commander's hatch on the hull of the 
combat vehicle for self-defense of the SAM system. 
  The 9A35M3 Strela-10M3 SAM System is being widely exported 
to 
foreign countries.

<H5>  Dual and Multipurpose Tactical Missile-Artillery Systems </H5>
  The 2K22M Tunguska Regimental Air Defense System presented 
by 
the Ulyanovsk Mechanical Plant is the first series-produced 
system in the world that permits the destruction of targets by 
both SAM's and artillery fire. The system is capable of 
conducting fire both on the move and from short halts and can 
destroy various airborne and ground-based targets, including 
hovering helicopters. The kill zone of one ZSU [antiaircraft 
artillery system] while firing the automatic antiaircraft guns 
is 0-3,000 in altitude and 200-4,000 m in range and 15-3,500 and 
2,500-8,000 m, respectively, while firing a 9M311 SAM. 
  The system consists of combat weapons (a battery of six 
SAM's) and maintenance equipment (six TZM's on KamAZ-43101 
chassis, two repair and maintenance vehicles on Ural-43203 
chassis, a maintenance vehicle on a Ural-43203 chassis, a 
maintenance shop on a ZiL-131 chassis, and automated 
monitoring-test equipment on a GAZ-66 chassis). 
  The 2S6M antiaircraft artillery system is manufactured on an 
armored tracked chassis and is designed to destroy airborne 
targets using artillery weapons in place, at short halts, or 
while moving under various weather conditions at any time of 
day, and also using missiles in place or at short halts under 
conditions of optical visibility. Effective firing by the 
automatic antiaircraft artillery guns is possible against ground 
troops and surface targets at a range of up to 2,000 meters. 
  The ZSU system consists of a radar, a digital computer, an 
optical gunsight with a guidance and stabilization system, 
hydraulic laying drives, two twin-barrel 30 mm automatic guns, 
eight launchers for installation of 9M311 SAM canisters, 
navigational equipment, a pitch and course angle measurement 
system, internal and external communications equipment, a 
life-support system, an electrical power supply system, and a 
tracked chassis.

  The system consists of a 9M311 guided missile that is 
designed to destroy airborne targets in the range of speeds from 
0-500 mps with a semiautomatic radar guidance system with manual 
target tracking and the system automatically brings the missile 
to the sighting line based on signals transmitted over a radio 
channel. 
  The SAM consists of an onboard electronic device, gyroscope 
coordinator, control surface drive unit, a tracker, a power 
unit, a warhead, a proximity target sensor, and separating 
engine unit (the missile moves toward the target based on 
inertia after the SAM's speed run and separation of the first 
stage).

  In contrast to similar Western systems, Tunguska corresponds 
to cost-effectiveness criteria to a greater degree because the 
most expensive elements in its design (the SOU [self-propelled 
gun mount] and the tracked armored chassis) are used to 
simultaneously support combat employment of the artillery and 
missile systems (in the FRG army the Roland SAM and the Gepard 
AAA systems and in the American army the Chaparral SAM and the 
Vulcan AAA systems are used simultaneously to support air 
defense at the battalion level). 
  The 9P149 Shturm-S System is designed to combat both tanks 
and other mobile armored targets and also low-flying, low-speed, 
airborne targets (helicopters and UAV's). 
  The mount is manufactured based on the MTLB amphibious, 
armored, tracked transporter. In the travel configuration, the 
launcher is retracted inside the hull. Reloading missiles is 
carried out automatically. The multipurpose 9M114 guided missile 
that is part of the system is manufactured according to a canard 
design with folding PGO [foreplanes] and wing (the latter has a 
semicircular shape and is pressed against the missile's 
cylindrical fuselage in the nonoperational state). It has a 
launch booster that ensures the missile exits the 
transport-launch canister, which is manufactured from fiberglass. 
  It has a semiautomatic radio command guidance system with an 
IR missile tracking system that has high jam-proofing (two codes 
and five fixed frequencies are employed to guide a missile).

  Development of the Shturm System was preceded by work on the 
development of antitank missile systems [ATGM] that began in the 
USSR in the 1950's (similar work began somewhat later in France, 
where they utilized German ATGM development experience at the 
end of World War II). Based upon primary specifications, 
domestically produced ATGM's are close to similar 
foreign-designed systems.

  Self-propelled artillery, which has been undergoing a 
process 
of rapid improvement both in our country and also abroad in 
recent times, is one of the most effective weapons to combat 
enemy tactical SAM's and ATGM's. 
  The 2S19 Msta 152 mm self-propelled howitzer on a tracked 
chassis that has been standardized with the chassis of the T-72 
and T-80 medium tanks and is equipped with a V84A 780-horsepower 
multifuel engine was displayed at the exhibition. The 
self-propelled artillery piece was developed under the 
leadership of General Designer Yu. Tomashov at the Uraltransmash 
Production Association, was accepted into the inventory in 1989, 
and is manufactured at a plant in Sterlitamak. 
  The self-propelled artillery piece includes the 2A64 gun; a 
PZU-5 antiaircraft gun mount with a Utes NSVT 12.7 mm 
antiaircraft machine gun that has remote control from the 
turret; an automatic loader with an automatic program to feed 
rounds that permits loading to be carried out from any angle of 
elevation of the gun; mechanization of ammunition feeding from 
the ground; an underwater tank driving equipment kit; a built-in 
bulldozer blade that ensures rapid preparation of firing 
positions; a filtering-ventilation unit; and a thermal smoke 
device to create a camouflage smoke screen. The elevation of the 
gun during firing is adjusted without the participation of the 
loader (the loader controls aiming only along the azimuth). The 
Msta self-propelled artillery piece can utilize all types of 
organic munitions, including precision-guided projectiles.

  Joint work in the sphere of self-propelled artillery is one 
of the possible directions of the Russian defense industry's 
international cooperation. In 1992 the French firm GIAT, which 
specializes in the production of artillery systems, demonstrated 
a model of its F1 (155 mm) caliber self-propelled automatic 
howitzer manufactured on a T-72 tank chassis (they were produced 
or are being produced in the USSR, Czechoslovakia, Poland, 
India, and Yugoslavia). In the opinion of foreign experts, the 
F1 howitzer is one of the best weapons of this class in the West 
and approaches, based on its specifications, the 2S19 
self-propelled artillery piece (the weight of the F1 
self-propelled artillery piece on an AMX-30 tank chassis--42 
tonnes, speed--60 kph, firing range of a conventional 
round--23.5 km, maximum rate of fire--8 projectiles per minute, 
carried basic load--42 projectiles, crew--4 men). More than 400 
GIAT systems are in the inventories of the armies of France, 
Iraq, Kuwait, and Saudi Arabia. 
  The Krasnopol Guided Artillery Projectile with a semiactive 
laser guidance system was developed in Russia for firing from 
152 mm guns. The projectile is designed both for firing from the 
most modern guns like the 2S19 Msta and 2S5 Giatsint and also 
from the older 2S3M and D-20 self-propelled and towed artillery 
systems. It can destroy with a high probability (0.7 when firing 
at a distance of 18,000 m) small mobile and fixed targets 
(tanks, motor vehicles, artillery pieces, fortified firing 
positions, etc.). So, during the course of a test firing, a tank 
that was moving at a speed of 36 kph was destroyed at a distance 
of 14,000 m. 
  A portable laser target designator installed on a tripod 
(installation of the illumination system on a helicopter, UAV, 
etc., is possible) is used for illumination. They managed to 
destroy three different targets in 30 seconds during test 
firings using one target designator. During firing at maximum 
range, the projectile's seeker is capable of locking on to 
targets in a radius of 1 km that are illuminated by the laser. 
The capability has been provided to fire at wind speeds of 25 
mps. During use of a 152 mm guided projectile in contrast to a 
conventional projectile of the same caliber, the expenditure of 
projectiles is reduced by a factor of 40-50 and the time 
required to destroy a target is reduced by a factor of 3-5. 
  The 9K112/9M117 Kobra ATGM (Western designation AT-8) was 
developed in 1981 for firing from 125 mm tank guns at a range of 
100-4,000 m. The missile has a radio command guidance system and 
is fired from T-64B, T-64B1, T-64B1K, T-80, T-80B, and T-80BVK 
tank smoothbore guns. 
  The 9K116/9M117 Bastion ATGM (AT-10) was developed in 1985 
and is designed to arm tanks and BMP's [armored infantry 
vehicles] and has a 100 mm gun (the missile is part of the basic 
load of the T-55AM2P, T-55AM2B, and T-55AMV tanks and the BMP-3; 
a special variant of this ATGM has been developed to arm the 
T-62M tank with a smooth bore gun). 
  The 9K120/9M119 Svir ATGM (Western designation AT-11) with a 
laser beam guidance system was developed in 1986. The missile 
attains speeds of up to 800 mps and is capable of penetrating 
700-800 mm thick armor and is part of the basic load of the 
T-72V, T-72S, T-80U, and T-80UD tanks. 
  The Kastet ATGM was developed for firing from the MT-12 (100 
mm) smoothbore towed antitank gun. 
  At the present time, foreign tanks do not have similar 
weapons and their development is not being conducted (the 
Shillelagh ATGM, which was launched through the barrel of a 
special short gun--a 155 mm launcher--was accepted into the 
inventory of the M60A2 medium tank and the Sheridan M551 light 
tank in the United States in 1967). However, the low ballistic 
specifications of the gun, which is incapable of conducting 
effective combat with enemy tanks using conventional projectiles 
at short and medium ranges, resulted in the rejection of this 
system. Development of a similar system in France also ended 
unsuccessfully.

<H5>  Shipborne Antiaircraft Missiles </H5>
  A significant amount of the exhibition's materials were 
concerned with shipborne antiaircraft missiles. 
  The Altair NPO, the general developer of maritime 
surface-to-air missile systems, presented information on the 
Shtil Medium-Range SAM System (Western designation SA-N-7) 
designed for air defense of ships or ship formations from 
antiship missiles and aircraft simultaneously attacking from 
different directions. It has the capability to conduct fire 
against surface targets. 
  The SAM system can be mounted on ships with a displacement 
of 
1,500 tonnes or more, has a modular design that ensures great 
combat survivability, simplicity of operation, and the 
capability for the customer to acquire the configuration he 
needs, with the number of channels, rate of fire, and basic load 
depending on the displacement of the ship-launch platform and 
the conditions of its combat employment. 
  The system operates with a ship three-dimensional [3-D] 
360Î surveillance radar that transmits current secondary 
information and can additionally have a built-in system of 
television-optical sights. 
  High automation of computer and execution devices, expansion 
of the missile fire zone from aimed launchers with regard to 
launch sectors restricted by the ship's superstructures, and 
stable operation of the system with seas of up to sea state five 
are ensured in the SAM system. 
  The system underwent testing on the Provornyy Design 61 BPK 
[large antisubmarine warfare ship], which was reequipped for 
this purpose in the mid-1970's, and at the present time is 
installed on Sovremennyy Class destroyers (the first ship of 
this class entered the line in August 1980). 
  The Shtil Single-Stage Solid-Fuel SAM Missile with a 
semiactive radar guidance system is standardized to a 
significant degree with the Gang/Buk SAM Systems missile. The 
SAM has a 70 kg warhead, a radio fuze, and is capable of 
maneuvering with a G-load of 20.

  The missile is launched from a surface launcher designed for 
one missile ensuring a high rate of fire. The weight of the 
launcher (without the missile) is 30 tonnes, the area of the 
magazine is 5.2 x 5.2 m, and the depth of the magazine is 7.42 m. 
  A high degree of modularity (numbers of configurations) of 
the design permits the system to be accommodated on ships of 
various classes and displacements (a design 61 model large 
antisubmarine warfare ship with two launchers mounted on a 
single gun platform on a tank was demonstrated on a stand at the 
exhibition).

  The Klinok Multichannel All-Weather Independent 
Surface-to-Air Missile System (Western designation SA-N-9) is 
designed for self-defense of combatants and civilian ships from 
massive attacks of low-flying antiship missiles and other 
unmanned and manned aircraft that operate at low and medium 
altitudes and also ships (including wing-in-ground effect 
vehicles). 
  The SAM system is capable of simultaneously destroying up to 
four targets in a spatial sector of 60 x 60Î while being 
aimed in a circle. Furthermore, the system is capable of 
controlling the fire of 30 mm automatic guns. 
  Its own airborne target radar detection systems provide the 
system with complete independence from ship radars and the 
capability for operations in the most complex situation. 
Furthermore, information that is received from any other target 
designation systems can be utilized. 
  The phased array antennas with electronic beam control and a 
high-speed computer system with developed software based on 
processing information in real time that uses a universal system 
of servicing subscribers is the basis of the system's 
multichannel capability: with sequencing, interrupts, and 
priorities. 
  The Klinok SAM System has high automation of combat 
operations--from the detection of targets to their destruction, 
low reaction time, and a high rate of fire. The system has an 
adequate depth of automated functional control and is reliable 
in operation. The television-optical target tracking devices 
built into the antenna mast increase its jam-proof feature under 
conditions of intensive countermeasures. 
  The underdeck launcher has three to four drum-type launch 
modules. There are eight transport-launch canisters with 
missiles in each module. 
  The SAM that has been standardized with the Tor Tactical SAM 
System has been utilized in the Klinok SAM System. Missile 
launch is vertical and is carried out using a catapult. After 
the missile leaves the launcher, a gas-dynamic system is set 
into motion that inclines the missile in the direction of the 
target. The engine is started at a safe altitude after the SAM 
is turned toward the target. Detonation of the 
high-explosive-fragmentation warhead is carried out according to 
the command of the pulse radio fuze in direct proximity to the 
target. The destruction of maneuvering and straight-flying 
high-speed targets is ensured thanks to the high speed of the 
missile's flight. 
  The missile is transported and stored in a transport-launch 
canister that ensures its storage, constant combat readiness, 
convenience while being transported, and safety while being 
loaded into the launcher. The missile needs to be inspected once 
every 10 years of storage. 
  According to the developing firm, there are no other 
self-defense SAM systems similar to the Klinok System. It can be 
installed on combatants and ships with displacements of 800 
tonnes or more. The system's modular design principle suggests 
different variants for its installation. The SAM system can be 
operated in various climactic conditions and can destroy targets 
under seas of up to sea state five. The crew strength of the 
Klinok System is 13 men.

  Admiral of the Fleet of the Soviet Union Kuznetsov, Admiral 
of the Fleet of the Soviet Union Gorshkov, and the Novorossiysk 
heavy aircraft-carrying cruisers, Kirov Class nuclear missile 
cruisers, Udaloy Class large antisubmarine warfare ships, and 
Neustrashimyy Class escort vessels are armed with the system. 
  The Rif SAM System, which is a development of the Fort 
Shipborne SAM System (Western designation SA-N-6), was developed 
at the Altair NPO for destruction of aerodynamic and ballistic 
targets at long range from the defended ship. The 48N6Ye missile 
that is part of the system has been standardized with the PVO 
strany S-300PMU SAM System. 
  The system can be accommodated on ships with a displacement 
of 5,000 tonnes or more. The SAM's are located in vertical 
underdeck launchers (a basic load of 48 or 64 guided missiles 
depending on system configuration). The rate of fire is three 
seconds. The SAM system is capable of simultaneously tracking 12 
targets and intercepting six targets. Maximum airborne target 
destruction range is 90 km. The missile is equipped with a 
powerful 130 kg warhead and can be employed against both 
airborne and surface targets. 
  Tests of the Fort SAM System were conducted on the Azov 
Large 
Antisubmarine Warfare Ship (Nikolayev Class) in the Black Sea 
Fleet. Kirov Class nuclear missile cruisers and Slava Class 
missile cruisers are equipped with Fort or Rif systems. 
<H5>  Multiple Rocket Launcher Systems </H5>
  Rockets that are part of the latest generation multiple 
rocket launcher systems were displayed at the exhibition. 
  The Prima (122 mm) Multiple Rocket Launcher System is 
designed to replace the Grad Multiple Rocket Launcher System and 
is also manufactured on a Ural motor vehicle chassis but has an 
increased number of launchers from 40 to 50. Remote introduction 
of the time of separation of the warhead in flight to increase 
the shrapnel kill area has been provided for. The operating 
temperature range is +/-50 ÎC. 
  The Uragan Multiple Rocket Launcher System (on a ZiL-135 
chassis) has rockets with high-explosive and fragmentation 
warheads and also warheads that are loaded with antitank and 
antipersonnel mines. One rocket can carry 30 cluster elements, 
24 antitank mines, or 312 antipersonnel mines. The firing of 
rockets singly or in salvos is possible. The area destroyed by a 
salvo from one launcher is 426,000 m[.sup]2[/], the duration 
of one salvo is 20 seconds, and the combat vehicle's range is 
570 km. The system includes a transloader vehicle. According to 
its specifications, the Uragan Multiple Rocket Launcher System 
is close to the American MRLS Multiple Rocket Launcher System. 
  At the present time, the Smerch Multiple Rocket Launcher 
System is the most powerful system of this class in the world. 
  The system consists of combat and transloader vehicles, each 
of which is a self-propelled unit based on a MAZ-534M four-axle 
motor vehicle chassis. An artillery section with 12 launchers is 
mounted on a combat vehicle and the transloader vehicle 
transports 12 projectiles and is equipped with a crane. The 
Smerch Multiple Rocket Launcher System is manufactured by the 
Perm Machinebuilding Plant. The fire control system supports 
salvo or single rocket launches. 
  Based on the assessments of the developing firm, the Smerch 
Multiple Rocket Launcher System exceeds other countries' latest 
salvo fire systems, including the American MLRS system that was 
employed in the war against Iraq in 1991. Superiority over 
similar foreign systems is noted not only based on the 
specifications of the artillery section but also based on the 
quality of the automated fire control system that is 
manufactured by Tomsk's Kontur Production Association. The 
automated control system links several command-staff vehicles 
that are at the disposal of the commander, unit chief of staff, 
and subunit commanders. Each of these vehicles, which are based 
on a KamAZ-4310 motor vehicle chassis, has radio equipment that 
supports communications in the UHF band at a range of up to 50 
km and in the HF band--up to 350 km. The rocket that is part of 
the system is configured with various types of warheads, 
including cluster warheads with 12 elements. The time required 
to bring the multiple rocket launcher system to combat readiness 
after a march is three minutes.

<H5>  8. Electronics and Reconnaissance Equipment </H5>
  The Nizhniy Novgorod Television Plant displayed the 1R13-3 
Metric Band Early Warning Radar that is designed for use in an 
air defense system. The radar is capable of detecting and 
determining the coordinates (azimuth and range) of airborne 
targets at great range under conditions of intensive electronic 
countermeasures and of determining whether they are friend or 
foe and transmitting information on the air situation to the 
command post via landline and radio communications channels. 
  The radar can be utilized as part of automated air defense 
and air force command and control systems (including those that 
are part of rapid deployment forces) and also independently. The 
entire radar system can be accommodated on four chassis and 
consists of: 

  -  a device module (weighing 12 tonnes and mounted on a Ural 
motor vehicle); 
  -  a trailer with a 2PN4-M with an NRZ 
[ground-based radio interrogator] radar antenna (weight five 
tonnes); 
  -  a primary antenna module with an APU cabin (Ural 11.5 
tonne); and, 
  -  an ED-2X30-T30P-3RA electrical power generator 
(KamAZ 12 tonne). 

    An additional configuration of the radar with a removable 
command post with two operator workstations that is mounted in a 
K1.P4 van is possible. 
  Speed along roads is 75 kph, maneuvering is possible on 
areas 
without roads, and transport is also possible by rail, water, 
and air. Deployment time from the travel configuration and 
teardown totals 45 minutes and, in the process, no special 
preparation of the area is required to install the radar. 
  The 1L13-3 Radar equipment module consists of a transceiver, 
an operator workstation, computer equipment, an information 
processing computer, built-in equipment monitoring and 
malfunction isolation equipment, a landline telecode 
communications system, two external radio communications sets, a 
simulator, and an IFF device. 
  The 1L13-3 Radar that is mounted on a separate three-axle 
trailer consists of a flat antenna array, an electric drive with 
a support-turning device, a deployment mechanism from the travel 
configuration, and canisters with an HF receiver and a removable 
protective cover. The ground-based radio interrogator antenna 
trailer consists of an antenna, a synchronized servo drive, and 
a spare parts kit. The radar is capable of detecting F-117A 
class low-observable aircraft. 
  The mobile electrical power generation unit consists of two 
30-kw diesel generators, automated and remote control equipment, 
and a panel for connection to an industrial grid. 
  The more powerful 55Zh6-1 Metric Band 3-D Radar developed by 
the same enterprise is designed for effective detection and 
determination of the coordinates of modern and future aircraft, 
helicopters, cruise missiles, aerostats, and also other aircraft 
under conditions of intensive reflections from ground clutter 
and man-made electronic countermeasures. 
  The radar can be operated under any meteorological 
conditions 
and in any climactic zones. The radar is capable of operating 
both as part of automated command and control systems and 
independently. Transportation of the radar is carried out by 
motor vehicle, rail, air, river, and maritime transport. 
Information on the radar's display can be recorded by the 
objective monitoring device. The system consists of an 
antenna-mast device (AMU); the antenna that is attached to the 
mast has a 16 x 3.24 m phased array. The vertical position of 
the mast is ensured by guy cables. The design of the 
antenna-mast device ensures its operability under conditions of 
an ice storm and wind loads of up to 35 mps. 
  The radar's transmitter and maintenance area are located in 
KPP-15 vans and include a radar reception device, a specialized 
microcomputer, two operator workstations, a function monitoring 
and diagnostics device, an IFF device, and also a simulator. 
  The transfer device contains a radar operating mode control 
device and three displays. The transfer indicator device 
equipment is designed to control and depict radar information at 
air traffic control facilities with a distance of up to 1,000 m 
via a cable line (it is possible to increase the number of 
operator workstations to five and to connect a second 55Zh6-1 
Radar). 
  The 50E6 Electrical Power Supply System consists of two 
diesel electrical power generators and a 
distribution-transformer device (it is possible to control the 
operating modes and turn the generator on from the maintenance 
area).

  The 35N6 2-D Radar was developed to replace the P-15 Tropa 
and P-19 radars. It is designed to detect targets with a reduced 
RCS (cruise missiles, UAV's, and light motor aircraft) that are 
flying at low altitudes at a range of speeds from extremely low 
to supersonic. Work on the development of the radar was begun in 
1983 under the leadership of V. Kopeykin and Yu. Stepanov headed 
the program after him. The first models of the new radar began 
to enter RTV [radiotechnical troops] units in 1986. 
  The 35N6 Radar permits the detection of small targets in the 
background of intensive reflections of the underlying surface, 
ground clutter, and hydrometeorological formations. The 
three-channel moving target selection system permits targets to 
be effectively isolated from interference. 
  The radar is mounted on two KamAZ motor vehicles: the 
electronic equipment (transmitter, receiver, monitoring and 
communications equipment, operator workstation, etc.) are 
located in the first KamAZ and the second KamAZ carries the 
antenna, a diesel electrical power generator for an independent 
power source, and an external power grid frequency transformer. 
It has a reserve power generator on a single-axle trailer. The 
operator's portable workstation can be deployed at a distance of 
up to 300 meters from the radar. 
  The radar can operate both with the main antenna and with an 
antenna that has been installed on a light mobile mast with a 
raised height of up to 50 meters. This permits the radar to be 
deployed in a forest, city, or on rugged terrain. 
  The 35N6 Radar's mean time between failures is 300 hours, 
and 
operation is possible at temperatures from -50 to +50 ÎC and 
at wind speeds of up to 25 mps in snow, ice storms, and rain. 
During the development of the radar, an adequately high level of 
comfort for the operators was ensured: the noise level has been 
reduced, there are air heating and cooling systems, and 
individual and sanitary ventilation. The absence of high-voltage 
power sources promotes work safety for the crew. The effect of 
X-rays and SHF radiation on people has been excluded. 
  During tests the radar successfully detected small 
light-motor aircraft piloted by test pilots who attempted to 
penetrate the air defense line at extremely low altitude. 
  The possibility of developing a specialized coastal radar 
based on the 35N6 radar to detect ships with small RCS's is 
being studied.

<H5>  8. Business Results of the "Mosaeroshow-92" Exhibition </H5>
  The "Mosaeroshow-92" Exhibition permitted Russian experts to 
expand business contacts with foreign partners. A number of 
contracts were signed with foreign and domestic aircraft 
companies. 
  The managers of the OKB imeni A.I. Mikoyan conducted 
preliminary negotiations with the British firm GEC Avionics on 
the possible large-scale modernization of the avionics of MiG-21 
aircraft that are widely operated in the world; signed an 
agreement on the creation of a joint venture with a German firm, 
the tasks of which will be the organization of assistance in the 
operation of the MiG-29's that are in Germany's inventory; and 
conducted preliminary negotiations on the sale of MiG-29's to 
Malaysia, and MiG-29's and MiG-31's to Portugal, South Korea, 
and Switzerland. Attempts are continuing to convince Germany to 
purchase an additional number of MiG-29 aircraft in an improved 
variant instead of the West European EFA fighter aircraft. 
  The OKB imeni P.O. Sukhoy also conducted negotiations with 
South Korea with regard to a possible sale of Su-27 fighter 
aircraft; it signed a protocol on intentions with Erbas 
Industries on certification of the Su-26 sports-acrobatic 
aircraft in France; and signed a contract with the French firm 
Thomson on cooperation in the sphere of the development of 
aircraft and navigational equipment for civilian aircraft. A 
preliminary agreement was attained on the sale of S-300PMU, 
S-300V, and Tor SAM Systems abroad. 
  On the opening day of the air show, the signing of an 
agreement took place between Russian International 
Airlines--Aeroflot, the Aviation Complex imeni S.V. Ilyushin, 
and the Voronezh Aircraft Production Association on the delivery 
of 20 Il-96M aircraft equipped with American Pratt &amp; Whitney 
engines and Rockwell-Collins equipment to Aeroflot beginning in 
1995 (the aircraft's first flight is planned for March 1993 and 
they propose deliveries beginning in 1995). At the same time, 
the receipt of an order for three Il-96M aircraft from Uzbek 
National Airlines was announced. The next day the signing of an 
agreement between Aeroflot, Rockwell-Collins, and the firm imeni 
S.V. Ilyushin took place for the installation of TCASII 
collision warning systems on Il-86 aircraft that are already 
being operated. 
  The leading Western firm Honeywell formed a new Russian firm 
under the name Honeywell Aviation Control Moscow to equip 
passenger aircraft with the latest flight-navigation equipment 
systems and delivered the first shipment for the new Tu-204 
airliner. The former socialist countries and China displayed 
interest in the exhibition and restoration of cooperation with 
these countries is considered possible. 
  The American concern Allied Signal, which sent the most 
representative delegation among Western firms to 
"Mosaeroshow-92" (30 experts), is already carrying out a number 
of joint programs with Russian partners and Bendix, which is 
part of the concern, and signed an agreement at the exhibition 
with the NII of Aviation Equipment on joint development and 
production of avionics equipment for existing and future Russian 
aircraft. This is the first major joint project of Western and 
Russian enterprises on avionics. At first, they propose 
installing liquid crystal displays (ZhKI) developed by Bendix in 
Il-96, Il-114, and Tu-204 passenger aircraft that are being 
produced for the Russian domestic market--this should be the 
first employment in the world of liquid crystal displays on 
series-produced aircraft. The liquid crystal displays on these 
aircraft will be used as part of flight mode optimization 
systems. In the future, they plan to develop complete 
flight-navigation systems based on liquid crystal displays for 
the Yak-42M, Yak-46, and Be-200 aircraft. 
  Allied Signal's projects that have already been carried out 
jointly with Russia are associated with other directions of the 
concern's activities: for example, Garret, a subsidiary of the 
firm, has begun to realize a major joint program with Omsk 
Engine Building Design Bureau for the development of a new 
auxiliary power plant that is oriented on Russian aircraft 
(which have different required air consumption than Western 
power plants) and includes Garret's turbine along with an Omsk 
MKB compressor and other auxiliary components. Allied Signal's 
large-scale presence is associated with the concern's basic 
policy toward expansion of cooperation with the CIS as a result 
of the strength of the CIS aircraft industry and the promise of 
its domestic market.
