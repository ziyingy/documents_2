  [Text] Guiyang, May 23 (XINHUA) -- China has succeeded in 
its water and soil control project on the upper reaches of the 
Chang Jiang river, the country's longest river, bringing 26,300 
square km of eroded land under control and raising forest 
coverage by 33 percent. 
  In an interview with XINHUA, Chen Junfu, an official in 
charge of water and soil conservation in the Chang Jiang River 
Water Conservancy Committee, said that the water and soil 
erosion control project started in 1989 on 795 rivers and 
streams in Yunnan, Guizhou, Sichuan, Shaanxi, Gansu and Hubei 
provinces. 
  To carry out the government-funded construction, local 
farmers have been improving farmland and building various water 
conservation projects and water diversion canals. They have 
also planted economic and water and soil conservation trees in 
the project areas. 
  A recent survey of 169 of the rivers involved showed that 
the 
harnessing percentage has now reached 87, and 72 percent of the 
soil there has been retained. The per capita arable land in the 
area has gone up from 0.035 hectares to 0.07 hectares. Each 
farmer has added 0.02 hectares of fruit trees. 
  The official said China will increase investment in the 
water 
and soil erosion control project so as to bring 93,000 square 
kilometers of soil erosion land under control before the end of 
the century, with special focus on the three gorges dam, a 
multimillion dollars hydroelectric project being built on the 
Chang Jiang river.
