  [Text] The United States is satisfied with Thailand's 
consistent efforts to solve the labour problem, notably that of 
child labour, in the country, Labour and Social Welfare Minister 
Phaithun Kaeothong claimed on Wednesday. 
  He said the message was conveyed to him during a courtesy 
call by US Ambassador David Lambertson. 
  The ambassador met him to discuss developments in Thailand's 
efforts to solve the problem, particularly as it affected 
children, women and work safety. 
  The labour issue was used by the US as a trade barrier, Mr 
Phaithun said. 
  He said the Thai Government had brought clauses on child 
labour up to international standards with the banning of any 
child under 13 from the work force. 
  The law also specified the type of work children could or 
could not do, he said. 
  Many revolutionary decrees were lifted and the state 
enterprise labour law was amended to allow state employees to 
set up unions, he said.
