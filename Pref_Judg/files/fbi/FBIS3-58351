<F P=106> [Article by Gilles Paris: "Preparing for the European </F>
Election -- Mr. de Villiers Will Lead Own List"] 
  [Text] There will be at least two competing lists from the 
majority at the next European Election. In addition to the 
one(s) devised by the RPR [Rally for the Republic] and the UDF 
[Union for French Democracy], "Combat pour les valeurs" 
[Defending Values], the group led by Philippe de Villiers 
(UDF-PR [Republican Party], will make its presence felt in an 
attempt to reignite the debate that went on during the 
Maastricht ratification campaign, on behalf of those whose 
opposed the Treaty. "We want a sovereign France in a new 
Europe. We want the election on 12 June to be an opportunity to 
ask for a referendum on a new European project," the Vendee 
representative [de Villiers] told his group's departmental 
officials in Paris on Sunday 8 January. 
  Mr. de Villiers' takes issue with at least six elements in 
the common platform which the two right-wing parties have been 
drawing up. These relate to the "urgent" integration of greater 
Europe, in other words, that of the former Soviet Block 
countries; the application of a "genuine Community preference"; 
the rejection of the single currency ultimately provided for by 
the Maastricht Treaty; the restoration of internal border 
controls removed pursuant to the Schengen Accord; the defense of 
a "strict and integral national citizenship"; and finally, the 
preservation of French sovereignty, "which Community practice 
has made meaningless." On the other hand, the president of the 
General Council of the Vendee Region [de Villiers] did not give 
any information on the identity of his fellow Brussels-bashing 
candidates. 
  Intent on avoiding a political split with the majority, the 
former first cohabitation minister [1986] [de Villiers] insists 
that a rival right-wing list in the European Election is no sign 
of dissidence. "The proportional voting system does not 
divide," he contends, "it enhances and enriches. Just imagine 
there is only one list, a pro-Maastricht one. What of all the 
French people who want another Europe?" Mr. de Villiers remains 
cautious, however. He does not expect high praise from the 
government for his initiative. 
  Mr. de Villiers is equally cautious in his appraisal of the 
prime minister's record; he describes Mr. Balladur as an 
"estimable and honorable" man. "The majority is large enough 
for it to include people who do not shrink from the truth," he 
suggests. While he said "no" to the GATT agreement through a 
vote of no-confidence in the prime minister, the leader of 
"Combat pour les valeurs" does commend the government for 
amending the Falloux Act [on private Catholic and state school 
funding]. "We said we would do it and so we did; it is as it 
should be and the government has earned praise for this," he 
claims.
