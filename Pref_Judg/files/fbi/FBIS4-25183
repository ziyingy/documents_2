  [Text] Shenzhen, June 6 (XINHUA) -- A factory building 
collapsed on Saturday [4 June] in a village in Longgang Town at 
Shenzhen, killing 11 people and seriously injuring nine who were 
all living in this unfinished construction. 
  Investigations so far indicate that the building was put up 
in breach of various regulations. 
  The building belongs to a plastics factory, in which the 
investor is a Hong Kong businessman named Wang Chengen. The 
firm is said to have hired an unregistered construction team. 
  The construction of the building was not given official 
approval. It did not have the necessary certificate for a new 
building. No geological survey was done. There were no proper 
architectural drawings, either, officials said. 
  It was jerry-built and the building materials and 
construction quality were very poor. Before the building was 
finished, when the third, fourth and fifth floors were still 
incomplete, the company had arranged for 106 of its workforce to 
live on the second floor. 
  When the accident happened, all the people living on that 
floor, except 32 who had gone out for early morning outdoor 
exercises, were trapped in the building. 
  The labor contractor of the building and a factory manager 
in 
charge of daily business were detained for further 
investigation. The detained person named Wang Ruipei is a 
younger brother of Wang Chengen. 
  The local procuratorate is investigating the accident.
