  [Text] A veritable powder keg was set off by the 
Constitutional Court's decision to legalize personal drug use. 
President Cesar Gaviria Trujillo was the first to express his 
rejection, stating very strongly that he does not agree with the 
decision. The Court, in view of the avalanche of criticism by 
presidential candidates and by the population in general, 
defended itself by saying that a mountain is being made out of a 
molehill. 
  The government and the Constitutional Court had a difference 
of opinion regarding the impact of the decision to legalize the 
personal consumption of drugs. The president says it is 
dangerous, while the Constitutional Court says the government 
and the Congress have ways to cope with the situation. 
  [Begin recording] [Gaviria] First, the government believes 
this will encourage an increase in drug consumption in Colombia, 
thus seriously undermining the tranquillity of the people and 
family development. It could also significantly increase crime 
and violence. 
  [Constitutional Court President Jorge Arango Mejia] That is 
a 
respectable opinion, which I do not share. The Constitutional 
Court has exercised its legitimate function of interpreting the 
Constitution. It has determined that a norm is contrary to the 
Constitution. 
  [Gaviria] It must also be clear that drivers or pilots 
cannot 
take drugs. No one could live in this society if that were 
allowed on the grounds that it is personality development. 
  [Arango] Regarding alcohol, a person can imbibe liquor, but 
he could commit a crime if he infringes upon the rights of 
another person in a criminal way. [end recording] 
  Finally, the court president said it was contradictory to 
authorize personal drug consumption and punishments for it at 
the same time.
