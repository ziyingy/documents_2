  [Text] For the first time in history, 1993 saw a natural 
decline in the number of people in the oblast. The birthrate 
dropped by 13 percent, while the death rate increased by 22 
percent compared with 1992. The number of births plunged to an 
unprecedented figure -- 8.9 births per 10,000 inhabitants. 
Meanwhile, the death ratio rose to 13 to three. According to 
specialists from the Committee for Employment and Social Issues 
at the Oblast Administration, the unfavorable changes in the 
residents' age that have occurred over the past few years are 
responsible for the declining birthrate. Another reason is the 
drop in the number of women of reproductive age (between 20 and 
29) as a result of the demographic wave caused by World War II, 
as well as of the family conditions of the adult population -- 
the larger part of those who have always been single or who are 
divorced. Other factors that are having an increased influence 
on the demographic process, in particular, on the natural 
population growth, are the critical economic situation, the drop 
in living standards, and residents' uncertainty over the future.
