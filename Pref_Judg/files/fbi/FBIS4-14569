  [Text] Samples of sea water and of the sea bed in the 
vicinity of where the nuclear submarine Komsomolets sank in the 
Norwegian Sea showed that radiation levels there stayed within 
normal background values over 10 recent days, the Russian Navy 
press office reported. 
  The report was made public in response to allegations, made 
public on 29 March 1994 in NEZAVISIMAYA GAZETA, that the 
radiation situation had dramatically deteriorated in the area. 
  The Northern Fleet Press Office emphasized that radiation 
was 
continuously monitored in the area where Komsomolets had sunk. 
Now the research ship Semyon Dezhnyov is staying in the area. 
The instruments it carries and the skill of its personnel make 
it possible to obtain reliable data on the situation.
