  [Text] The spokesman for the Jewish settlers in Hebron and 
activists of various right-wing organizations have declared a 
non-violent civil uprising in the wake of reports that most 
cabinet ministers support the evacuation of Jews from Hebron. 
According to our correspondent Gil Litman, they announced the 
upgrading of their opposition to the government's actions to the 
level of a civil uprising, which will be manifested in passive 
resistance to evacuation and other orders.
