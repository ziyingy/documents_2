  In the 10 years that AIDS has been reported in Colombia, it 
has officially caused 1,800 deaths. Nevertheless, according to 
the National Survey on Knowledge, Attitudes, and Practices 
Related to Sexually Transmitted Diseases, 121,000 people may be 
infected with the virus in Colombia. The survey was carried out 
among 18,000 people and was contracted by the Social Security 
Institute. It found that 20.3 percent of the men tested positive 
while 1.3 percent of the women tested positive. That means that 
out of the total population, 118,093 men and 3,538 women might 
test positive. This would be equivalent to 35 out of every 
10,000 Colombians. (Santa Fe de Bogota EL TIEMPO in Spanish 1
