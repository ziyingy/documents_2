  [Text] Washington, 3 May (XINHUA) -- U.S. President 
Clinton said on the evening of 3 May that he hoped the United 
States and China would be able to reach agreement on the human 
rights issue so that he could make a decision in early June on 
extending most-favored-nation [MFN] status to China. 
  Clinton made the above statement at a news conference in 
Atlanta, Georgia, which was televised by CNN worldwide. 
  Clinton said: Judging from current actual conditions, China 
has made significant comprehensive progress in many areas. 
However, in order to work out the differences existing between 
the United States and China before the 3 June deadline, "we 
still have a way to go." 
  He added: I believe that if we were to withdraw China's MFN 
status, U.S.-Chinese relations would be undermined. He said he 
did not wish to see this happen.
