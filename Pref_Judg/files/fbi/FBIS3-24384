  [Text] Heretofore unheard-of figures were cited yesterday 
at a meeting in Smolnyy: 32,400 children were born in St. 
Petersburg in 1993, while in the same period 85,600 persons 
died. For the first time in the history of the city, the 
mortality rate exceeded the birth rate by a factor of more than 
2.5. The family crisis situation is leading to the fact that the 
birth rate is dropping catastrophically not only in St. 
Petersburg, but in the whole country--89.9 percent of the 
families consist of two to four persons; moreover, a big part 
consists of two persons. There has been a significant increase 
in recent years in the number of single mothers older than 40 
years of age and younger than 18. 
  The attention of the rayon family and children departments 
was turned at the conference to the socially unprotected 
families--giving them material (and humanitarian) assistance and 
offering moral support. The obligations of the rayons also 
include making resources available for subsidizing school 
lunches. After approving the city budget, compensation will be 
paid, as before, for newborn children.... 
  How effective such assistance is can be evaluated according 
to the very same statistical data--only 98,000 children out of 
the 997,700 children of St. Petersburg are being reared in large 
families. It is probable that the birth rate is unlikely to 
increase this year either.
