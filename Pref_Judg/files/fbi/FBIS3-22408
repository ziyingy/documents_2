  [Text] New Delhi -- Former vice chairman of Planning 
Commission Mohan Dharia, who is currently heading Vanarai, 
people's movement for a green India, has alerted Prime Minister 
P.V. Narasimha Rao of moves by certain vested interests to 
secure forest land for growing raw material for industries. 
  The disclosure made during an international workshop on 
India's forest management and ecological revival, have spurred 
Dharia to write to the Prime Minister and seek his intervention 
in attempts to dilute the forest policy. 
  "Raw material required for paper or wood industry should be 
produced on private lands and valuable forests reserved for 
permanent green cover and natural biosphere," Dharia says. 
  Most of the wastelands in the country belong to individuals 
and with farm forestry, it is possible to make them productive. 
"In view of the great threat to our environment, I am sure you 
will not deviate from the earlier policy of the Government on 
forests. Environmentalists in the country are opposed to the 
move to hand over forest lands to industry," says Dharia.
