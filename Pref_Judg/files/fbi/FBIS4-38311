  [Text] Sanaa, 29 Jun (INA) -- A Yemeni pilot flying a Mig 
[not further identified] today carried out a heroic assignment. 
He hit a battleship of the secessionists in Wa'm Am'an [name as 
received] in the Arabian Sea. The battleship was destroyed and 
sunk, according to a military source [word indistinct] here 
tonight. 
  The pilot, who was martyred, had swooped on the ship that 
was 
bombarding Aden refinery and the legitimate forces in Little 
Aden, al-Haswah, and al-Sha'b. 
  The source emphasized that the secessionists are seeking 
[words indistinct] all the economic facilities in Aden, having 
realized their flight from the city is imminent.
