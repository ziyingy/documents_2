  [Text] International treaties are usually agreements 
benefiting two parties; one party cannot decide when to comply 
and when not to. It seems that this is now the case with an 
agreement signed by the United States and Colombia on bases for 
the surveillance of drug trafficking. 
  In this case, it was clear Colombia rendered a service to 
the 
United States and not the other way around. It would be 
preferable for our policy to be increasingly independent because 
those installations are not useful even for monitoring civilian 
air traffic in Colombia, rather for rendering service only to 
U.S. addicts [viciosos].
