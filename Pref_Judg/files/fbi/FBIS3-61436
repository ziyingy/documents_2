  [Abstract] Two global decreases in the total transparency 
of the atmosphere have been observed in long-term measurements 
of the total fluxes of direct solar radiation in the Arctic and 
Antarctic. These were associated with the eruptions of Agung in 
March 1963 and El Chichon in April 1982. Direct measurements of 
the spectral aerosol optical depth of the atmosphere at both 
poles showed that a new decrease in total transparency since 
1982-3 is associated with an increase in aerosol attenuation. 
Measurements of optical d epth using the ABAS solar photometer 
were used to pinpoint the effect of the eruptions of Mt. 
Pinatubo (Philippines) and Mt. Hudson (Chile). It was found that 
the aerosol optical depth of the atmosphere in 1992 was a factor 
of 2-3 larger than the average value and was comparable with the 
value observed in the Arctic after the El Chichon eruption. 
Tables present atmospheric transparency values and aerosol 
optical depth figures for this time period (and other periods, 
for comparison). Figures 2; tables 2; references 4: 3 Russian, 1
