  [Text] Taipei, Feb. 28 (CNA) -- Taiwan is seeking 
cooperation from Russia for the joint management of Taiwan's 
nuclear waste, a UNITED DAILY NEWS report from Moscow said 
Monday. 
  Deputy Manager Lin Ying of the state-run Taiwan Power 
Company, who is currently heading a Taipower nuclear energy task 
force on a fact-finding tour of Russia, said Russia's 
established nuclear expertise and facilities could serve as an 
example for Taiwan. 
  Lin also said that Taiwan is seeking approval for processing 
and storage of high-level radioactive waste in Russia. He noted 
that the proposed plan could proceed after discussion of issues 
including shipping and processing charges. 
  Waste incinerators in Russian nuclear power plants are 
fueled 
with high temperature and low pollution plasma rather than oil, 
a technology superior to that used in the United States, Lin 
said. 
  Taipower is under strong pressure to develop a nuclear waste 
management policy. Government laws stipulate that Taipower must 
finalize its nuclear waste policy and present for government 
review by 1997. 
  Currently, low-level radioactive waste from Taipower's 
nuclear power plants is incinerated on-site before being sent to 
Lanyu Island for storage. 
  However, Lanyu villagers have protested against the storage 
and Taipower's planned expansion of storage facilities on the 
island. 
  Taipower has also proposed the storage of nuclear waste at 
more than 30 spots around Taiwan, but the company is facing 
enormous opposition from environmentalists and residents of 
proposed waste sites. 
  The opposition has forced Taipower to seek waste storage 
sites overseas and the company is now planning to ship low-level 
radioactive waste to several sites in Zhejiang and Guangdong 
Provinces on the Chinese Mainland, the newspaper reported.
