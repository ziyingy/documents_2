  [Text] The Uzbek Interior Ministry expressed concern over 
what it called "the subversive activities" pursued by 
politicians who had left the country. In a statement made 
public Tuesday the ministry said that "certain megalomaniac 
figures who left Uzbekistan have started attempts at 
destabilizing the republic." 
  "Slanderous literature" on alleged human rights violations 
in 
Uzbekistan is said to be smuggled into the country through 
channels which are used to traffic weapons and narcotic drugs. 
The overall aim, the statement said, is to "discredit the 
policies of the Uzbek leadership and sow panic and ethnic 
tension." 
  The ministry promised to do its best, jointly with other law 
enforcement agencies in the country, to put an end to the 
subversive activities. 
  No names are mentioned in the statement. Leaders of the 
Birlik popular movement, the Erk democratic party and the human 
rights society who have left the country over the last two years 
accuse the Uzbek authorities of having installed a totalitarian 
regime.
