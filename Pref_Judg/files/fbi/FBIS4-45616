  [Text] Puerto Vallarta, Mexico, May 23 KYODO -- The 
International Whaling Commission (IWC) opened its annual meeting 
Monday [23 May] to uncertainty over a French-led proposal for a 
giant whale sanctuary in the Antarctic to prevent commercial 
whaling. 
  Taking part in the five-day meeting are delegates from 33 of 
the IWC's 41 member countries along with observers from 
environmental groups. 
  The Japanese delegation issued a statement ahead of the 
meeting claiming the sanctuary lacks justification on scientific 
and biological grounds. 
  The sanctuary proposal is meant only to hamper sustainable 
use of marine resources, said chief Japanese delegate Kazuo 
Shima, deputy head of the Fisheries Agency. 
  There is no choice but to depend on marine resources for 
long-term food supply for the next generation when a worldwide 
food shortage is expected in the early 21st century due to steep 
population growth, he said in the statement. 
  The proposed sanctuary runs from the Antarctic to the 40th 
parallel. 
  Opponents led by Japan and Norway have advanced a 
counterproposal calling for the sanctuary to be set southward 
from the 60th parallel and excluding minke whales, which have 
survived in bigger numbers than other species. 
  Any proposal requires a three-quarters' majority to be 
passed 
but chances of a sanctuary being approved are almost even, 
delegates said.
