  [Text] Tokyo, April 6 KYODO -- A joint survey of the Sea 
of Japan by Japan, South Korea and Russia found no particular 
effects of Russia's radioactive waste dumping, Foreign Ministry 
officials said Wednesday [6 April]. The survey team, consisting 
of experts from the three nations and from the International 
Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA), found no particular abnormalities 
in seawater and seabed samples compared with past data, the 
officials said. 
  Operating from a Russian-registered oceanographic survey 
ship, the Okean, the team began a study of the seawater and 
seabed of the Sea of Japan on March 18 following the Russian 
dumping of liquid nuclear waste in October. The team took water 
samples from both the ocean surface and deep within the sea at 
seven survey spots southeast of Vladivostok, and the survey 
ended Wednesday. 
  Official results of the survey will be announced after 
detailed analysis is complete, the officials said. 
  The Russian Navy dumped 900 tons of liquid nuclear waste in 
the Sea of Japan in October 1993. A planned second dumping was 
canceled following protests from Japan and South Korea.
