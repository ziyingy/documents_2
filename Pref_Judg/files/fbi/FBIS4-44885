  [Text]NTT and Microsoft are developing delivery services 
for multimedia information. They have begun work on a software 
delivery system that uses compact-disc ROMs (CD ROMs). In 
another venture, NTT Data Communication is working with Softbank 
on setting up a company to deliver video-on-demand. Both 
alliances are efforts by NTT to borrow outside expertise to 
realize the idea of multimedia. 
  NTT announced it formed a joint venture with Microsoft in 
March to begin developing a multimedia information delivery 
service. The joint development by both companies is a basic 
technology for distributing software for personal computers, 
movies, and music over networks. Their goal is to implement a 
new delivery system for multimedia information. 
  NTT had just entered into a joint venture with General Magic 
in January 1994. That makes this the second agreement made with 
a foreign software vendor. NTT's aim is to reflect the powerful 
software technology for terminals onto its network services. 
  Several days after the announcement of the venture between 
NTT and Microsoft, NTT Data Communication and Softbank, the 
giant distributor of PC software, revealed that they will 
bolster NTT's efforts. Both companies will use NTT's 
optical-fiber network and establish a new service-providing 
company for video-on-demand to deliver movies to viewers when 
desired. 
  In the announcement made in January 1994, NTT emphasized the 
need to form bonds with other companies. (See ``The Basic Idea 
of Multimedia,'' Nikkei Communications, 7 February 
1994, pp. 21-23.) Through this dramatic series of alliances, NTT 
stands at the starting line for achieving this idea. 
<H5>  Distributing CD ROM Encrypted Keys </H5>
  Two technologies will be developed with Microsoft. One is a 
delivery system for PC software and movies using CD ROMs. The 
software is encrypted and stored on CD ROMs. The user will pay a 
software licensing fee to receive an encrypted key on line. The 
second technology connects NTT's facsimile communication 
service, F-Net, to Microsoft's software systems for office 
automation, At Work. Neither technology, however, is touted as a 
true multimedia delivery system. 
  Figure 1 illustrates the system configuration of a software 
delivery system using CD ROMs. The user buys inexpensive CD ROMs 
storing encrypted PC software, movies, music, and games. The 
encryption method is based on NTT technology. Encrypted software 
cannot be directly used. The key must be purchased to release 
the code; it is transmitted over the NTT network. NTT will 
collect software usage fees from users. Future studies will 
involve transmitting not only keys, but the software itself.

  Who will supply the CD ROMs? Distributors of PC software are 
among the companies expressing interest. Masayoshi Son, 
president of Softbank, comments that if a new delivery 
infrastructure can be created, his company would aggressively 
use it. According to him, the job of a distributor is to collect 
software and store it on CD ROMs. Softbank is already beginning 
a similar service in the United States. The user places an order 
by telephone, receives the key to release the encryption from an 
operator, and enters it into the personal computer. 
<H5>  Making F-Net Compatible with At Work </H5>
  The objective of connecting F-Net to At Work is to use the 
graphical user interface (GUI) provided by At Work and simplify 
the operation of F-Net. Its implementation is planned for a year 
from now. At that time, the data transmission protocol of At 
Work will be supported by F-Net. 
  The advantage is communication costs are controlled if F-Net 
is used when a large number of facsimiles are broadcast over 
short distances. However, using F-Net is not always convenient, 
for example, registering the broadcast destinations presents 
problems. There are two registration methods. The first sends 
the list of destinations to NTT. Here, registration lasts 
several days. In the second method, the destinations are entered 
on the mark sheet used by NTT, then this sheet is sent by 
facsimile. In this case, registration is immediate, but filling 
in the mark sheet is complicated. This task can be simplified by 
using the facsimiles incorporated into At Work and PCs. 
<H5>  Target: 10 Million Subscribers by 2000 Using NTT Optical </H5>
Fibers 
  The joint venture established in April 1994 by NTT Data 
Communication and Softbank is called Mediabank Enterprises. NTT 
Data Communication's percentage of the investment is 40% 
and 
Softbank's is 60%. Masayoshi Son, Softbank's president, 
is also 
acting as the president of the joint venture. In addition to 
video-on-demand, ticket sales, karaoke, games, telemarketing 
businesses are being planned. 
  Full operation is slated to begin in March 1995. Until then, 
preparation of the rate structure for users and information 
providers and selection of the equipment needed in two-way cable 
and television are proceeding. NTT Data Communication will be in 
charge of the operation of the center's facilities. 
  Son stated a goal of 10 million household subscribers by the 
year 2000 and presented a model plan for a bold rate structure 
(Figure 2). A set-top CATV converter box is loaned free of 
charge.

its name to Mediabank when it begins operation.

  According to Son, NTT's infrastructure will be the maximum 
limit of the network for providing services. As one link in the 
multimedia idea, optical fibers will extend to ordinary 
households who will probably become major users. There are no 
plans at this time to use the cables owned by CATV businesses. 
In 1995 NTT will participate in tests of multimedia services for 
homes. 
  Until the optical-fiber network spreads, business start-ups 
will focus on markets for specific applications, for example, 
delivering movies to hotels, or supplying karaoke and software.
