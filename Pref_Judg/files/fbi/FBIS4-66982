  [Text] Homong, Burma -- Opium warlord Khun Sa said over the 
weekend he hoped to be able to declare the Shan State's 
independence from Burma in three years, and called for European 
support for his movement. 
  His associate, Chao Saengdeun Saengkham, also expressed hope 
that the group and its supporting Mong Tai Arny (MTA) would be 
able to extend its authority over a larger portion of Burma's 
northeastern Shan State within one to two years. He said they 
hope by then to be able to declare a govemment with the 
participation of seven other ethnic groups -- Akha, Lahu, 
Palaung, Pa-O, Tai, Tashin, and Wa. 
  Khun Sa was being interviewed by THE NATION at his 
headquarters in Homong. At the time he was seeing off about 
3,000 newly trained troops who were leaving for the frontlines 
to counter advancing Burmese forces approaching from the westem 
side of the Salween River. A few days earlier the MTA had 
dispatched other fighters to join about 2,000 MTA forces already 
operating on the other side of the river. An aide said the 
fresh troops would be sent to the Sino- Burmese border to 
encircle Burmese forces.
