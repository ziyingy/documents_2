Billion Rubles From Government"] 
  [Text] The State Duma Committee for Information Policy and 
Communications has made a proposal in the draft 1994 Russian 
Federation budget that 1.5 trillion rubles [R] (of the R2.2 
trillion requested) be allocated to the "Ostankino" state 
television and radio company, that R287 billion be allocated to 
regional state television and radio studios, and that R176 be 
allocated to newspapers. This was reported by M. Poltoranin, 
the committee's leader. 
  Meanwhile the government has prepared a directive to the 
Finance Ministry to allocate R4 billion to the SOVETSKAYA 
ROSSIYA newspaper. This decision was made after a meeting 
between SOVETSKAYA ROSSIYA's chief editor and Vice Premier Yuriy 
Yarov. The reliable source who reported this recalled that mass 
publications such as TRUD and LITERATURNAYA GAZETA had been 
unable to obtain state subsidies.
