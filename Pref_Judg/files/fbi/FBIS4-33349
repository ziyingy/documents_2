  [Excerpt] Admiral Jorge Martinez Busch, Navy commander in 
chief, told LA TERCERA that Chile's effective occupation of its 
ocean territory can be accomplished only by increasing the 
merchant fleet capacity and fishing activities, scientific 
research, ocean sports, and the development of maritime culture, 
not only through art but also with photography, poetry, and 
novels. 
  These comments by the high-ranking Navy officer were in 
reaction to President Eduardo Frei Ruiz-Tagle's proposal to 
create, in six months, a National Oceanic Commission to seek the 
effective occupation of the seas. 
  Following his policy of refraining from public comment on 
issues raised by the highest political authorities of the 
country, Martinez Busch said, however, that when the commission 
is installed "our institution will be ready to provide all the 
necessary technical data to achieve the objectives proposed by 
the president." [passage omitted]
