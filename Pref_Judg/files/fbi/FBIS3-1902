Come Here for the Sake of Friendship"] 
  [Excerpts] Kitakyushu (Japan), 2 Mar (XINHUA) -- Chinese 
Vice Premier Zhu Rongji and his party, who are on a tour of 
Japan's Fukuoka Prefecture, visited the Yasukawa Electric 
Machinery Company in Kitakyushu city this afternoon. They were 
accorded a warm welcome. 
  On display in the company's reception hall, where Zhu Rongji 
and the other Chinese guests entered, was a horizontal board 
inscribed with four big characters: "Peace in the World." It 
was given to Mr. Keiichro Yasukawa, founder of the electric 
machinery company, by Dr. Sun Yat-sen, the great pioneer of 
China's democratic revolution. [passage omitted] 
  Zhu Rongji told Mr. Yasukawa with deep feeling: "The 
Yasukawa family's support and assistance to Dr. Sun Yat-sen 
contributed to China's revolution, and to friendship between the 
Chinese and Japanese people. I feel it is particularly 
meaningful to visit your company today. I come for friendship 
between the Chinese and Japanese people that will last from this 
generation to future generations." 
  Yasukawa Electric Machinery Company manufactured the world's 
first electric-powered industrial robots in 1970, and since then 
it has been a leading industrial robots manufacturer in the 
world. As Zhu Rongji and his party entered the company's 
workshop amidst applause, a pair of robots danced to welcome the 
Chinese guests. One robot, accompanied by a lady, presented a 
bouquet of beautiful fresh flowers to Zhu Rongji. The vice 
premier and his entourage viewed the demonstration of different 
robots with great interest. [passage omitted]
