  [Text] The attorney general says the refusal of IDF [Israel 
Defense Forces] soldiers to carry out any order to evacuate 
Jewish settlements in the territories would be an act of 
disobedience bordering on rebellion. In an address to the 
Editors Committee, Mikha'el Ben-Ya'ir said: A soldier can 
disobey an order only if it is patently illegal. He said the 
issue of withdrawal from settlements was in dispute among 
jurists and, therefore, soldiers were duty-bound to obey such an 
order since it was not indisputably illegal.
