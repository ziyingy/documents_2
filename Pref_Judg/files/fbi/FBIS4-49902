  [Text] Guangzhou, May 10 (XINHUA) -- A Chinese ocean survey 
ship, the "Haiyang No. 4", left here for mid-Pacific waters 
yesterday to search for seabed minerals. 
  Official sources said the vessel would engage in a survey of 
metal nodules in an area of 150,000 sq [square] km that has been 
allocated to China by the United Nations for investigation. 
  The sources said that this is the sixth time since 1986 for 
the vessel, owned by the Chinese Ministry of Geology and Mineral 
Resources, to carry out such a mission. 
  By employing submarine photography and detection means, 
scientists on the vessel will try to work out a metal nodule 
distribution map in an area of 33,000 sq km, the sources said. 
  They added that scientists on the vessel were also equipped 
with the most advanced international "sea beam" system, which 
would be used in drawing maps of the submarine terrain. 
  The "Haiyang No. 4" will also continue the unfinished survey 
which was being carried out by the "Xiangyanghong No. 16", 
another Chinese survey vessel, before it was involved in an 
accident, the sources said. 
  Two technicians -- one from Algeria and one from the Sudan 
-- 
dispatched by the United Nations, will be trained on the ship in 
ocean survey operations, the sources said. 
  The ship also carries three experts from "International 
Ocean 
Metals", and their equipment for joint studies. 
  On board the "Haiyang No. 4" are 86 persons, 46 of them 
being 
researchers. 
  The vessel will cover about 30,000 nautical miles in the 
survey, which is scheduled to last until December 26 this year.
