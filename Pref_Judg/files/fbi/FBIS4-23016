  [Abstract] A 14.8 kbp chromosomal DNA fragment, designated 
T16, was cloned from Yersinia pestis TWJ and a 
restriction map made of the fragment. T16 was tested with 
subfragments in dot hybridization with Y. pestis, Y. 
pseudotuberculosis, and Y. enterocolitica, as 
well as with enterobacteria such as shigella, salmonella, and 
various strains of intestinal bacilli. The fragment was used to 
construct a 980 bp DNA probe species-specific for Y. 
pestis. In a number of strains of the pseudotuberculosis 
microbe, the researchers found nucleotide sequences with a 
relative homology for Y. pestis. The restriction map 
indicates the absence of the EcoRI site of the CM fragment in 
the T16 sequence, suggesting either that the authors cloned DNA 
fragments similar to those cloned by Bardarov et al. (FEMS 
Microbiol. Lett., 1990, Vol.71, pp 277-280) or that there are 
structural differences in that region of DNA in the strains 
Y. pestis TWJ and EV. A nucleotide repeater was, 
indeed, found. Figures 2, references 15: 7 Russian, 8 Western.
