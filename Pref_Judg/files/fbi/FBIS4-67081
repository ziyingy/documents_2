  [Text] The Muang Tai Army (MTA) of drug warlord Khun Sa 
has attacked a Burmese government "caravan of gems" thought to 
be carrying 1,000 kilograms of heroin to Tachilek, near the Thai 
border, an MTA source in Chiang Mai said yesterday. 
  Fighting was continuing with reinforcements from both sides 
arriving at the battlefield, the source said. 
  He said fighting between the MTA and Burmese army had 
started 
on April 23 in the middle of Shan state. 
  "We are certain that the gem caravan also carries a ton of 
Number 4 heroin to Tachilek (a Burmese border checkpoint 
opposite Chiang Rai)," the source said. 
  "There are 10 trucks carrying goods and another 10 carrying 
soldiers as guards." 
  The caravan had set out from Mong Hsu, a mining city. It had 
passed through Kunhing, Huapaang, Mong Ping, Tongtaa, Keng Tung, 
Doi Muai, Mong Lang and Mong Ko, the source said. 
  The location of the battle is Mong Ping. 
  The source said the convoy guards belonged to the State Law 
and Order Restoration Council (Slorc) Army Unit 331, which 
recently occupied Mong Kyood, in MTA territory. 
  He claimed the MTA had taken the first two trucks of the 
caravan but could not say whether they were army or goods trucks. 
  "We are predicting an extended phase of military engagement 
here. If MTA's leader Khun Sa can get hold of all the trucks, it 
will considerably discredit Slorc's image. 
  "Slorc maintains that it has nothing to do with the drug 
trade," the source said. 
  Khun Sa had sent nearly 800 soldiers from Hua Mong, the 
headquarters town of MTA, to support the forces engaging Slorc. 
  Slorc had sent nearly 4,000 soldiers from Mong Pan, Unit 99, 
to protect the caravan and fight off MTA forces. 
  Slorc was also getting support from the army of a minority 
Chinese group, the Kokang, which engaged in gem mining with 
Slorc, the source said. 
  Khun Sa said last week that he was sending 3,200 soldiers to 
the North, but would not reveal their precise destination for 
security reasons.
