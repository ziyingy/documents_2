  [Text] Vienna, April 13 (XINHUA) -- China will support as 
ever international efforts in drug control, said a Chinese 
delegate at the 37th session of the UN Commission on Narcotic 
Drugs opened here today. 
  ``The Chinese government will...devote serious attention to 
and intensify international cooperation in the field of 
narcotics control...and take an active part in every specified 
activity in the domain of international drug control and will 
make its own contribution in this regard,'' said Chen Shiqiu, 
head of the Chinese delegation. 
  In particular, China will ``spare no effort to support the 
Golden Triangle sub-regional drug control cooperative activities 
and projects,'' he added. 
  Chen, who is also the Chinese representative in the 
Vienna-based UN and other international institutions, reported 
to the meeting on China's anti-drug achievements. 
  China has been placing special emphasis on the interdiction 
effort against transit drug smuggling in its southwestern border 
areas through comprehensive measures to strictly prohibit drug 
trafficking, cultivation and abuse, and intensified drug law 
enforcement, he noted. 
  In 1993, the Chinese drug law enforcement agencies handled 
26,191 cases, apprehended 40,834 suspects and seized 3,354 
kilograms of opium, 4,459 kilograms of heroin and 90 metric tons 
of essential chemicals and precursors destined for the Golden 
Triangle area for drug processing. 
  In addition, China had last year 50,000 persons/times [as 
received] treated in more than 200 drug detoxification centers 
and currently gives treatment to 15,000 drug addicts. 
  Chen said that the Chinese government has put all 22 
controlled chemicals under the export licensing system as 
requested by the 1988 UN convention designed to prevent 
diversion of pharmaceutical drugs into illicit channels. 
  The conference of the UN Commission on Narcotic Drugs, which 
will conclude on April 22, is expected to review the work of the 
UN International Drug Control Program and International 
Narcotics Control Board. 
  It will in particular review the progress made by individual 
countries in implementing the drug control convention and a UN 
resolution on the issue approved by the 48th session of the UN 
General Assembly last year.
