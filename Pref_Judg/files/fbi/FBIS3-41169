  [Text] U.S. Assistant Secretary of State for International 
Narcotics Matters Robert F. Gelbard, accompanied by a group, 
paid a courtesy call this morning on Deputy Prime Minister 
Amnuai Wirawan. The deputy prime minister noted the longstanding 
good relations between Thailand and the United States, 
especially their cooperation and mutual understanding in 
narcotics suppression. The Thai Government has paid special 
attention to this problem, and has been trying to get 
cooperation from its neighbors Burma, Laos, and China to wipe 
out production sources. Gelbard said that there is a trend of 
drug addiction becoming a more complicated and more serious 
problem as technology continues to advance. There is also 
growing consumer demand. He thanked the Thai Government for its 
consistent cooperation with the U.S. Government in fighting 
against narcotics.
