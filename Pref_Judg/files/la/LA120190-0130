Attorneys for Robert Alton Harris, in another try to save the convicted killer 
from the gas chamber, said Friday they have new evidence backing their claim 
that authorities improperly recruited and coached a jailhouse informant to 
testify falsely at Harris' 1979 trial. 
</P>
<P>
The lawyers asked the U.S. 9th Circuit Court of Appeals to order a hearing 
where they could prove the informant acted as a "police agent" and had been 
planted in Harris' cell to elicit statements to show Harris murdered his two 
teen-age victims to prevent them from testifying against him for robbery. 
</P>
<P>
The informant, Joey Dee Abshire, said in an affidavit signed Nov. 7 that 
investigators -- not Harris -- provided him with details of the crime. Abshire 
also disputed testimony by a San Diego sheriff's sergeant who said he overheard 
Harris tell Abshire he killed the boys because he "couldn't have no punks 
running around that could do that (identify him) so I wasted them." 
</P>
<P>
But while challenging the sergeant's version of the conversation, Abshire said 
in the affidavit -- just as he said at the trial -- that Harris "told me the 
boys were killed to prevent them from identifying him." 
</P>
<P>
The testimony by Abshire and the sergeant were key elements in showing the 
killings were premeditated and deliberate -- rather than impulsive -- and thus 
made Harris eligible for first-degree murder and the death penalty. 
</P>
<P>
State Deputy Atty. Gen. Jay M. Bloom said the new allegations had just been 
received and were being studied. "It does seem that this is a claim that could 
have been raised much earlier in a case that's 12 years old," Bloom said. 
</P>
<P>
Harris, 37, is seeking a retrial in the murders of John Mayeski and Michael 
Baker, both 16, in San Diego in 1978. If he loses in his current round of 
appeals, he could become the first person to be executed in California since 
restoration of the death penalty in 1977. 
</P>
<P>
The condemned man's legal team -- attorneys Charles M. Sevilla, Michael J. 
McCabe and Michael Laurence -- had contended earlier that Harris had been 
victimized by Abshire's role as police agent. But last August a federal appeals 
panel rejected the claim, citing a lack of sufficient evidence. 
</P>
<P>
In their new motion, Harris' lawyers said that after extensive investigation 
they had finally located Abshire and another jailhouse witness. Their new 
testimony revealed Abshire's previous statements were "false in several 
material respects," they said. Harris, they said, was the victim of a 
"carefully orchestrated maneuver" by authorities. 
</P>
<P>
The attorneys said that contrary to prosecution claims, investigators had 
recruited Abshire, advised him of the specific information they needed from 
Harris, supplied details of the case, coached him on how to testify and then 
told him to "conceal his role as a state agent." 
</P>
<P>
Such conduct by officials would violate a defendant's constitutional rights and 
invalidate any resulting evidence. If a hearing is held and the state is found 
to have acted illegally, Harris could win a new trial. 
</P>
<P>
Abshire, whose current whereabouts were not divulged, said in the Nov. 7 
affidavit that when he first encountered Harris in jail Abshire considered him 
as a "nut case." Abshire said he complained to a bailiff that the inmate was 
"talking about killing kids" and subsequently was taken to an office where 
authorities told him about the case and recruited him to inform on Harris. 
</P>
<P>
Abshire said that after being placed in a cell with Harris, the accused killer 
"did not seem mentally balanced or rational," and that without the information 
he received from police, "it would have been very difficult for me to get 
Harris to say much about it." 
</P>
<P>
The informant also said that contrary to the sergeant's testimony, Harris did 
not refer to the victims as "punk" or say he had "wasted them." 
</P>
<P>
Abshire said that before the trial he met with investigators at least three 
times "to rehearse my testimony." He said he had been "coached" to say he had 
not had any discussion with authorities over what punishment he should receive 
for jail escape and theft, the charges he faced in California. In fact, Abshire 
said, he had told investigators he wanted to dispose of the charges with a 
16-month prison sentence. 
</P>
<P>
The informant said further he had been coached to say a deputy was outside the 
cell where he spoke with Harris and to say no one had asked him to question 
Harris about the case. 
</P>
<P>
In a separate affidavit dated Nov. 15, Sonny Arthur Wisdom said he had been in 
the jail nearby and had been surprised to hear Abshire "persisting in asking 
incriminating questions" while Harris "did very little talking." Wisdom said 
Harris did not refer to the boys as "punks" and "did not volunteer anything" 
incriminating.
