At last! Your splendid series has moved the debate beyond rehash and rhetoric 
to a serious weighing of the risks and benefits of decriminalization.

Like democracy as a form of government, decriminalization is surely the worst 
form of drug control except for all those other forms of repression that we're 
now trying. And when Decter calls advocates of decriminalization "would-be 
engineers of human conduct," and Los Angeles Police Chief Daryl Gates (March 
15) labels them "treasonous," we can see what the war on drugs really is: a 
make-believe Armageddon between two kinds of addicts -- those addicted to 
drugs, and those addicted to force.
