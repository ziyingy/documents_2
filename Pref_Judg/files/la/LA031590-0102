The first meeting of the two Germanys and the four victorious World War II 
powers on the subject of German unity was held here Wednesday, and the 
participants agreed to invite Poland to attend sessions at which the 
Polish-German border issue is discussed. 
</P>
<P>
The head of the host West German delegation, diplomat Dieter Kastrup, said that 
at this first meeting, the Germanys, the United States, the Soviet Union, 
Britain and France discussed procedural questions and an agenda for further 
meetings. The meeting lasted seven hours. 
</P>
<P>
He said the participants had agreed not to spell out the details of their 
meetings, the next of which will be held in East Berlin after the East German 
national election Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
But Kastrup did reveal that Poland, whose government had expressed anger at 
being left out of the talks, will be permitted to attend any sessions concerned 
with the controversial border question. He gave no details. 
</P>
<P>
"The participants agreed Poland will be invited as soon as questions are 
discussed . . . that especially affect its borders," Kastrup said. 
</P>
<P>
The government of Prime Minister Tadeusz Mazowiecki wants firm guarantees that 
Poland's postwar frontier with East Germany, incorporating vast tracts of 
prewar Germany, will remain undisturbed. West German Chancellor Helmut Kohl 
earned himself widespread international criticism by seeming to hedge on making 
such a pledge. 
</P>
<P>
Under pressure of world opinion, Kohl reversed himself last week, and his 
government offered a resolution in the Bundestag, or Parliament, making the 
pledge. But the Poles were not satisfied with promises. They want negotiations 
on the border issue to begin before the two Germanys are reunited. 
</P>
<P>
The so-called two-plus-four talks on reunification, agreed to by the Western 
allies and the Soviet Union, are designed to resolve the terms of a reunified 
Germany, as well as its future place in the European security system and such 
matters as the final status of Berlin. 
</P>
<P>
The four victorious nations have residual rights in Germany and over Berlin 
because no peace treaty was signed to formally end World War II. The division 
of postwar Germany into eastern and western zones of occupation by the victors, 
followed by the formation of separate states as the Cold War quickly hardened 
the East-West dividing line, foreclosed the possibility of a final peace 
settlement for the past 40 years. 
</P>
<P>
The process was set forth during a meeting of foreign ministers in Ottawa last 
month. The two Germanys first are to forge a preliminary accord on steps toward 
unity, dealing with internal and domestic issues, and the four powers would 
then deal with the security and foreign policy issues. 
</P>
<P>
The two Germanys held their first meeting on unification last Friday. 
</P>
<P>
Wednesday's talks were at the mid-diplomatic level, with the United States 
represented by State Department counselor Robert Zoellick, Assistant Secretary 
for European Affairs Raymond Seitz and National Security Council official 
Condolenza Rice. 
</P>
<P>
West German Foreign Minister Hans-Dietrich Genscher said Wednesday before the 
meeting that West Germany's goal at the talks is "that the foreign aspects of 
the establishment of German unity be dealt with in harmony with the European 
unification process and European security." 
</P>
<P>
The German unity question will probably be taken up informally at a higher 
level when the foreign ministers of all six countries -- except East Germany -- 
are scheduled to attend independence ceremonies for Namibia on March 21 in 
Windhoek. 
</P>
<P>
A chief sticking point in the discussions is expected to be whether a united 
Germany should be neutral or remain within the North Atlantic Treaty 
Organization. 
</P>
<P>
Kohl and the three Western allies want a united Germany to remain a staunch 
member of the alliance, but Soviet President Mikhail S. Gorbachev has insisted 
that a united Germany remain neutral. 
</P>
<P>
Poland, however, believes that a united Germany within NATO poses less of a 
risk to East European countries than a strong, united Germany that is not 
anchored to the Atlantic Alliance. 
</P>
<P>
The East German position will be unclear until after the results of Sunday's 
election are known and a new government formed.
