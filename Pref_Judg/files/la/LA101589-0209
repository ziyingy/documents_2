The philosophy and beliefs expressed by Sherry Lee Meddick ("Traffic Solutions 
and Measure A," Oct. 8) sadly reflect the ideas and misconceptions of many 
Orange County residents with regard to their responsibilities for solving our 
transportation and other societal problems.

By stating that she has paid gasoline taxes for 20 years in justifying her 
opinion, Meddick ignores the fact that Californians, compared with 1969, should 
be paying a 50-cent-per-gallon gasoline tax just to keep up with the effects of 
inflation and the fuel-efficient automobile.

The Silverado resident also says she did not cause the problems. Nonsense! We 
all did, and we will continue to make them worse unless we end our 
recalcitrance toward justifiable taxation and overcome the demagoguery of many 
of our political leaders.
