Andy Rooney Sparks Gay Protest: Andy Rooney was accused Tuesday of homophobia 
by a major gay organization after they said he suggested that homosexual 
relationships caused AIDS. Rooney, whose "A Few Minutes With Andy Rooney," 
often serves as a tag to "60 Minutes," has said that he "feels innocent of any 
negative behavior toward homosexuals," and that he counts gays among some of 
his friends.

Many of the objections raised by the Gay and Lesbian Alliance Against 
Defamation (GLAAD) stemmed from Rooney's year-end television special which 
aired on CBS Dec. 28. Rooney said: "There should be some recognition that in 
1989 many of the ills that killed us are self-induced. Too much alcohol, too 
many drugs, homosexual unions and cigarettes quite often led to premature 
deaths." Rooney said he has gotten hundreds of letters about his comments and 
had sent a response to the gay magazine The Advocate in which he apologized and 
promised: "I'll be more careful." GLAAD spokesman Craig Davidson said GLAAD 
wanted Rooney to apologize on the air for his remarks. CBS said it was 
reviewing the situation. BETH KLEID
