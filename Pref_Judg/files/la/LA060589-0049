<P>
The woman loved mirrors and had placed them lavishly around her apartment, 
where she lived alone. 
</P>
<P>
Normally an easygoing, sociable type, she seemed agitated one day and finally 
confessed to her visiting sister that her house mates made her angry. They 
never returned her friendly greetings. 
</P>
<P>
Later, her doctor listened sympathetically and explained to the woman's family 
that such delusional beliefs -- springing from an inability to recognize people 
-- are common in patients with Alzheimer's disease, a degenerative brain 
disorder. 
</P>
<P>
Alzheimer's disease afflicts 2.5 million to 4 million Americans and is a type 
of senile dementia, a broad disease category that also includes other types of 
organic brain disorders. 
</P>
<P>
Although he usually cautions against reinforcing delusions, her physician, Dr. 
Stephen L. Read, medical director of the John Douglas French Center, a facility 
for Alzheimer's patients in Los Alamitos, suggested draping the mirrors. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm almost embarrassed to admit I did this," he said recently. "But she got 
better. She believed the people were still there, but she felt a lot better 
because they weren't looking at her all the time." 
</P>
<P>
Read's anecdote, relayed at a recent medical conference, reflects the challenge 
facing Alzheimer's disease researchers and physicians. For them, focusing on 
science alone -- searching for the cause, diagnostic methods and treatments -- 
isn't enough. They must also create common-sense solutions to help ease the 
often nightmarish lives of patients and those who care for them. And they must 
alert care givers about behavior changes, a phenomenon not yet completely 
understood. 
</P>
<P>
In the last decade, the ranks of Alzheimer's disease researchers has swelled 
from a handful to more than 500 nationwide, estimated Zaven Khachaturian of the 
National Institute on Aging at a recent conference sponsored by the John 
Douglas French Foundation for Alzheimer's Disease, Los Angeles. Research 
funding has increased from $90 million last fiscal year to $130 million in 
1989, according to Claire McCullough, an NIA spokeswoman. 
</P>
<P>
Despite that explosion of interest and infusion of funds, scientists are still 
not certain about what causes the disorder, first described in 1906. At 
autopsy, the brains of Alzheimer's patients show two abnormalities: plaques, 
clusters of degenerating nerve cell ends, and tangles, masses of twisted 
filaments that accumulate in previously healthy nerve cells. And there is as 
yet no definitive treatment for the disorder, marked by memory loss and 
personality changes, communication difficulties and time disorientation. 
</P>
<P>
Still, a number of research avenues may ultimately help unlock the puzzle. 
While some researchers focus on the origin of the disease, others are 
investigating better diagnostic methods. And others are zeroing in on 
psychosocial aspects. Research presented at the recent conference, along with 
investigations at the Alzheimer's Disease Research Center at USC, one of 10 NIA 
research centers nationwide, have shed light on a number of areas. 
</P>
<P>
The long-term debate over the cause of Alzheimer's disease continues, with 
scientists suggesting genetic, viral and environmental origins, or a 
combination. Activation of some genetic factor is probably responsible, Dr. 
Leslie P. Weiner, USC chair of neurology and professor of microbiology, told 
conference participants. "There's no hard evidence for the viral theory," 
Weiner claims. 
</P>
<P>
Fewer researchers today espouse the viral theory than in the past, Read 
believes. The idea that a viral infection causes brain cell death "remains a 
theoretical possibility, but there is very little experimental evidence," he 
said. 
</P>
<P>
In addition, some researchers now believe that there are different forms of the 
disease. In a study of 100 Alzheimer's patients, David Freed, psychologist on 
staff at the USC Alzheimer's Disease Research Center, identified three 
subgroups. One subgroup has a loss of nerve cells containing acetylcholine (a 
type of "messenger" brain chemical called a neurotransmitter) in the basal 
forebrain. Another group has loss of nerve cells with norepinephrine, another 
neurotransmitter, in the brain stem, and may also lack acetylcholine. In 
another subgroup, Freed found movement changes, including tremor and rigidity, 
and he speculates there may be a loss of nerve cells containing dopamine. This 
form of the disease is thought to result from long-term exposure to workplace 
toxins such as metals and solvents, Freed said. 
</P>
<P>
Another USC researcher, Dr. Helena Chui, associate professor of neurology, is 
studying how the plaques form and has developed two hypotheses. Something may 
go awry in the nerve cells themselves, or the plaque may originate from the 
blood vessels. "The capillaries in Alzheimer's disease patients are very 
irregular," she said. In her studies of autopsied brains, she has found some 
capillary parts in the plaque. 
</P>
<P>
Another researcher, Dr. Carol Miller, USC associate professor of pathology and 
chief of neuropathology, is using molecular probes to determine exactly which 
nerve cells are affected in the disease and to track the pattern of 
progression. Among other questions she's investigating: Does the disease have 
identical progression from one patient to another? And how do healthy nerve 
cells differ on a molecular level from affected ones? 
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, other researchers are trying to find better diagnostic methods. 
Definitive diagnosis of Alzheimer's disease is only possible, experts say, by 
biopsy, a procedure rarely done for the disease, or by autopsy. 
</P>
<P>
But several less invasive techniques are yielding diagnostic clues as well. An 
imaging technique called SPECT (single photon emission computerized tomography) 
is "the best noninvasive procedure we have for making the diagnosis of 
Alzheimer's disease," claims Dr. Ismael Mena, director of the division of 
nuclear medicine at Harbor/UCLA Medical Center, Torrance, and a UCLA professor 
of radiological sciences. When memory loss is the presenting symptom, Mena 
said, SPECT can help determine whether it's due to stroke, depression or 
Alzheimer's. 
</P>
<P>
In the procedure, a radioactive isotope is injected into a vein and an hour 
later an image is taken of the brain. From the computerized brain picture, the 
clinician can study the perfusion of blood into the the brain's temporal and 
parietal lobes. Reduced blood flow into both temporal and both parietal lobes 
is "a fingerprint of Alzheimer's disease," Mena said, but not of depression or 
stroke. Since early 1988, Mena has used SPECT on more than 100 Alzheimer's 
patients and predicts its use will increase dramatically, partly due to the 
recent availability of new and better imaging agents. 
</P>
<P>
Also under study as a diagnostic method is the computerized 
electroencephalogram, a tracing of the brain's electrical activity. 
</P>
<P>
In healthy people, brain waves in the alpha range predominate and wave 
frequencies don't change much with age, explained Dr. Cyrus K. Mody, clinical 
instructor of neurology, and Dr. Hugh McIntrye, professor of neurology, both at 
Harbor/UCLA Medical Center. But in Alzheimer's patients, alpha waves decrease 
and are replaced with slower delta or theta waves. The computerized EEG 
technique correctly diagnosed all but one of 50 patients in a recent study at 
Harbor/UCLA, according to researchers there. The method can also evaluate 
severity, say the scientists, with greater changes suggesting more advanced 
disease. Currently, several teaching hospitals and about four Los Angeles area 
hospitals perform the computerized EEGs for Alzheimer's detection. 
</P>
<P>
Other researchers are piecing together typical behavior patterns and 
psychiatric symptoms of Alzheimer's patients. Delusional beliefs such as those 
affecting the interior decorator are common, Read finds. "Families often 
consider the beliefs trivial in talking to doctors," he said. Patients often 
believe someone has stolen everyday objects like wallets or purses and accuse 
the vague "they." Some patients who no longer recognize a spouse "accuse the 
care givers of not being there when in fact they are present 24 hours a day. 
</P>
<P>
"Sometimes a delusion is really an unconscious response to an environment that 
has become very much too complicated for a patient," he said. In general, Read 
advises family and friends not to reinforce delusional beliefs, but 
acknowledges that in the case of the interior decorator, he successfully broke 
his own rule. 
</P>
<P>
Behavior changes vary greatly, he finds. Besides having delusions, patients 
might become more out of touch, more listless and dependent, act more 
childishly or become cruel or mean-spirited. Not all Alzheimer's disease 
patients become more agitated as the disease progresses, Read said, although 
that stereotype flourishes. Some become more passive; some display more 
self-centered behavior. Agitation is more common in patients who have had the 
disease longer, Read said. 
</P>
<P>
Another common behavior, wandering, can provoke anxiety and exhaustion in 
family members and nursing home staff, especially when patients escape from 
home or facility. But wandering is believed to be a coping mechanism, a way to 
adjust to altered perceptions of the environment, and perhaps a response to 
loneliness, said Lynne Morishita, director of the Center for Geriatric Health 
at Century City Hospital and UCLA assistant clinical professor of nursing who 
also spoke at the conference. Most likely to wander, she finds, are patients 
who tended to pace or fidget in their younger days. 
</P>
<P>
As Alzheimer's disease becomes more well-known by the public, physicians face 
another dilemma. Aware of the disease, older Americans begin to worry about 
becoming a victim. 
</P>
<P>
"A lady came to see me recently because she ran a red light," Read said. "We 
spend a fair amount of time undiagnosing Alzheimer's disease these days." And 
according to the experts, the patient who says to his doctor, "I think I have 
Alzheimer's disease," almost never does.
