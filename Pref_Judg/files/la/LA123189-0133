"This project," declared Kathryn Kellogg, "was born of my personal hate of 
seeing trees in a dumpster and seeing a tree lot the day after Christmas with 
all those leftover trees that will go to a landfill. It just made me sick." 
</P>
<P>
Kellogg has reason for such displeasure. After all, she's a Kellogg -- a member 
of the family that, for 65 years, has manufactured fertilizer and soil 
amendments. As corporate secretary of Carson-based Kellogg Supply Inc., it's in 
Kellogg's interest to look for new sources of business.

And these days, she's looking at Christmas trees. Carson Christmas trees, to be 
precise.

Under a new program developed in conjunction with city officials and Western 
Waste, which picks up residential trash in Carson, Kellogg Supply will recycle 
the city's trees into compost. Western Waste has agreed to pick up the trees -- 
which must be free of metal stands, tinsel, ornaments and flocking -- at the 
side of curbs Jan. 3-5.

Carson Mayor Mike Mitoma said the program "marks Carson as a leader in the 
recycling effort in California." 
</P>
<P>
The composting program is similar to one already used in Santa Monica, also 
involving Kellogg Supply. But it is unlike most municipal Christmas tree 
recycling programs, in which trees are ground into chips that are used as fuel 
for boiler plants. 
</P>
<P>
According to Kellogg, the Carson program will take the recycling one step 
further -- full circle, so to speak -- by converting the trees into a product 
that is "very comparable to rich Midwest topsoil." It can then be used to help 
new plants grow.

<P>
The compost will not, however, nourish other Christmas trees. Kellogg says her 
company's products are for the most part used in home gardens, on shrubs, 
lawns, rose bushes and azaleas. 
</P>

Those who do not live in Carson but want to put their old Christmas tree to 
good use can take the tree to one of seven Los Angeles recycling collection 
sites. In the South Bay, trees will be collected every day except New Year's 
Day from 8 a.m. to 4 p.m. at Harbor Regional Park, Vermont Avenue and Pacific 
Coast Highway in Harbor City. The program ends Jan. 6. Sheryl Stolberg
