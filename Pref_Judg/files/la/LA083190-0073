A $400,000 federal grant has been awarded to the Los Angeles Community 
Redevelopment Agency for street improvments in a six-block area of Wilmington 
Industrial Park, it was announced Thursday.

<P>
The Economic Development Administration funds, coupled with a matching $400,000 
from the CRA, will go toward repairing C Street and Lecouvreur Avenue with 
sewers, storm drains and paving. 
</P>
<P>
The work is scheduled to be completed by June, 1992.

The industrial park was designated a CRA project by the Los Angeles City 
Council in 1974 with the aim of converting the area's dirt roads, junkyards and 
vacant land into a business center. Since then, according to the CRA, 28 new 
commercial buildings have opened in the project area, generating nearly 1,000 
jobs.

<P>
The latest grant, applied for two years ago, will allow further improvements to 
the area, according to city officials.

"Opening up C Street will provide the community and industrial park workers 
with more access to businesses within the park, as well as make the area more 
attractive and functional," Councilwoman Joan Milke Flores said in a prepared 
statement released after the grant was announced. Flores' district includes 
Wilmington.
