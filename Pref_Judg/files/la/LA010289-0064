What are the best investments for 1989? 
</P>
<P>
To answer that question, The Times asked five investment experts to decide how 
they would invest $10,000, in both conservative and risky portfolios. For the 
conservative portfolio, the experts assumed that $10,000 was all they had to 
invest, and thus they couldn't afford to lose any of it. For the risky 
portfolio, the experts assumed that $10,000 was part of a total $100,000 
portfolio, and thus they could afford to take capital losses. 
</P>
<P>
Not surprisingly, the experts disagreed on the outlook for the stock market. 
But they all agreed that staying away from the market entirely would be a 
mistake because there are plenty of individual stocks or stock mutual funds 
that should do well, even if the market as a whole heads down. 
</P>
<P>
Here are their picks: 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
DONALD J. PHILLIPS 
</P>
<P>
Phillips is editor of Mutual Fund Values, a Chicago investment advisory service 
that evaluates performance, risk, expenses and other key measures for 1,082 
mutual funds. 
</P>
<P>
Outlook: With so much money on the sidelines, stocks and stock mutual funds 
should do well again in 1989, he says. 
</P>
<P>
Conservative $10,000: Phillips slips $5,000 into Vanguard Short-Term Bond Fund, 
a no-load (no sales charge) mutual fund that invests in fixed-income securities 
with slightly longer maturities than those in money market funds. But the fund 
could return as much as 2 to 3 percentage points more than money funds, with 
virtually no risk of loss of principal, he says. It has posted average 
compounded annual returns of 10.41% in the past five years. 
</P>
<P>
Phillips pops another $3,000 into T. Rowe Price New Income, a no-load fund with 
bonds of even longer maturities than the Vanguard fund. It has earned average 
compounded annual returns of 10.33% for the past 10 years. He tucks his last 
$2,000 into Strong Investment Fund, which he describes as one of the more 
conservative funds with exposure to stocks, which constitute up to 40% of its 
portfolio. It boasts an average compounded annual return of 10.72% in the past 
five years. 
</P>
<P>
Risky $10,000: Phillips splits it equally into four stock funds. Two, Royce 
Value Trust and Gabelli Equity Trust, are relatively new "closed-end" funds 
whose shares are traded on the New York Stock Exchange and are managed by 
well-respected money gurus Charles Royce and Mario Gabelli, respectively. As 
evidence of Royce's record, his older Pennsylvania Mutual fund has posted 
average annualized compounded returns of 19.54% for the past 10 years. Gabelli 
Asset Trust had gained 35.47% in the 12 months ended Nov. 30. 
</P>
<P>
Phillips favors two no-load mutual funds. One is Nicholas Limited Edition, a 
2-year-old small-company stock fund managed by Albert Nicholas, whose older 
Nicholas Fund has posted a compounded annual return of 20.23% over the past 10 
years. The other is GIT Equity-Special Growth, another small-company fund that 
has posted a compounded annual return of 14.9% over the past five years. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
GERALDINE WEISS 
</P>
<P>
Weiss, editor and publisher of Investment Quality Trends, a La Jolla 
newsletter, is a leading expert on dividend-oriented investing. Her 
newsletter's recommendations were up 21.2% in 1988 through October, according 
to Hulbert Financial Digest, a newsletter that tracks performances of other 
newsletters. 
</P>
<P>
Outlook: While the market as a whole has more room to fall than to gain, many 
stocks are undervalued and have little downside risk. The key is to find stocks 
whose dividend yields are at levels where their historical trading patterns 
show they were near the bottom in price and thus undervalued. 
</P>
<P>
Conservative $10,000: Weiss sticks to simplicity: She puts it all in insured 
savings accounts or certificates of deposit. She likes to keep her CD 
maturities staggered so that some cash is always coming available. 
</P>
<P>
Risky $10,000: Weiss taps nine stocks. Her first choice, for $1,500, is 
Bristol-Myers, a company that consistently raises dividends and is historically 
undervalued with a dividend yield of about 4.5% (she considers 4% or more to be 
levels at which it is undervalued). For another $1,500 she taps Xerox, which is 
undergoing a turnaround, lowering costs and increasing profit margins. Its 
yield of 5.5% makes it highly undervalued. 
</P>
<P>
Weiss splits her remaining $7,000 equally among seven blue chip stocks that she 
considers to be close to undervalued levels, based on dividend yields. They are 
Schlumberger, Texas Utilities, Houston Industries, Baxter International, 
International Business Machines, American Medical International and Eastman 
Kodak. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
JOHN W. ROGERS JR. 
</P>
<P>
Rogers, at age 30, is a rising young star in mutual fund management. His 
Calvert Ariel Growth, a small-company growth stock fund, was up 31.83% this 
year through Dec. 9, among the year's top performers. That followed a 11.4% 
rise in 1987, a strong gain in a year when the crash made losers of many stock 
funds. 
</P>
<P>
Outlook: Select stocks of quality companies that enjoy solid market shares in 
stable, non-cyclical businesses, but that are also undervalued and followed by 
few analysts. 
</P>
<P>
Conservative $10,000: Rogers places $4,000 into money market funds. The rest 
goes into two conservatively managed stock mutual funds with excellent 
long-term reputations that he expects will continue to do well even in a down 
market. "It's nice to have growth as part of your portfolio," even if it's your 
first $10,000, he says. 
</P>
<P>
Rogers puts $4,000 of the remainder in Acorn Fund, a no-load fund with domestic 
and international stocks that has posted a compounded annual return of 18.78% 
in the past 10 years. The other $2,000 goes into Evergreen Total Return, a 
no-load stock and bond fund with a compounded annual return of 17.99% in the 
past 10 years. 
</P>
<P>
Risky $10,000: Rogers divides his risky $10,000 evenly between seven stocks. 
One of his favorites is Clorox, the bleach maker with a strong cash flow and 
balance sheet. Its share price has been beaten down somewhat by analysts' 
concerns that earnings will be negatively impacted by its planned rollout of a 
new detergent -- concerns that Rogers finds overblown and shortsighted. 
</P>
<P>
Rogers also likes McCormick &amp; Co., a spice concern flush with cash that 
seems to be followed by few analysts. Next he selects two office products 
stocks: United Stationers, the nation's largest distributor of office products, 
and Sanford, known for its markers and pens. 
</P>
<P>
He also picks two specialty packaging firms: Shorewood Packaging, the largest 
packager of records, compact discs, cassette tapes and music videos, and 
Sealright, the top ice cream packager. Finally, he taps SEI, a large pension 
fund consulting firm. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
NOLA MADDOX FALCONE 
</P>
<P>
Falcone is co-manager of Evergreen Total Return, a stock and bond mutual fund 
that's among the top performers among so-called growth and income funds that 
seek capital gains as well as dividend income. 
</P>
<P>
Outlook: The stock market will be sluggish, but real undervalued stocks with 
strong dividend yields will hold up well. 
</P>
<P>
Conservative $10,000: Falcone puts $5,000 in two-year Treasury notes, currently 
yielding about 9.11%, higher than 30-year Treasury bonds. She tucks the other 
$5,000 into a money market fund. 
</P>
<P>
Risky $10,000: Falcone puts it into three "depressed" stocks with good yields 
that will limit downside risk. "I wouldn't mind putting my mother into these," 
she says. The first $4,500 goes into Bristol-Myers, a company misperceived by 
investors who don't realize that it has turned into a high-growth drug company 
with exciting new products in such fields as cancer treatment and orthopedics, 
she says. 
</P>
<P>
Falcone slips another $2,500 into First Fidelity Bancorp, whose stock was 
pushed down following a recent announcement of a huge writeoff due to poor 
loans. The negative reaction has been overdone, she says. As a extra bonus, the 
stock yields about 7.7%. 
</P>
<P>
Her last $3,000 goes to Springs Industries, a towel and comforter maker that 
recently bought a company that makes industrial fabric used in electronic 
circuit boards, aerospace construction and marine industries. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
JOHN D. CONNOLLY 
</P>
<P>
Connolly is chairman of the investment policy committee at Dean Witter 
Reynolds, currently among the most bullish of Wall Street investment firms. 
</P>
<P>
Outlook: Stocks will do well largely because interest rates will begin to 
decline in coming months. At that point, he says, investors will pull money out 
of short-term fixed-income investments and put it into stocks. 
</P>
<P>
Conservative $10,000: Connolly socks it simply into one-year CDs, which have a 
better return than Treasury bills. "If you can't afford to lose, you can't 
afford to play" with stocks and other higher-risk, higher-return investments, 
he says. 
</P>
<P>
Risky $10,000: Connolly divides it equally among five stocks that he considers 
undervalued with price-earnings ratios (stock price divided by earnings per 
share) far under what he thinks they should be. 
</P>
<P>
The first, Price Co., is a retailer that he expects to enjoy 25% earnings 
growth. Next he tabs Computer Associates, the nation's biggest independent 
supplier of systems software. 
</P>
<P>
Connolly also likes H. F. Ahmanson, a strong savings and loan firm that could 
benefit from lower interest rates and a resolution of troubles plaguing the 
S&amp;L federal deposit insurance system. His fourth pick is Schering-Plough, a 
drug firm that he expects will post 20% annual earnings growth in the next two 
years. 
</P>
<P>
His final selection is Monsanto, a chemical and drug firm that has been hurt by 
adverse rulings on an intrauterine device. It is selling far under the price 
shareholders would get if the company was broken up, Connolly says. 
</P>
