Has this ever happened to you? 
</P>
<P>
You're walking through the city park when suddenly you spot a bevy of healthy 
quail strutting between the bushes. 
</P>
<P>
You whip out your grenade . . . and just as you're clamping your teeth on the 
pin, you stop -- because you realize you'd be breaking the law. 
</P>
<P>
Or you're walking past the civic center, where thousands of peace terrorists 
are demonstrating against legitimate defense expenditures. You want to make a 
powerful statement and a quick getaway with a well-tossed grenade, but the law 
says you're a criminal if you carry one, so you left yours at home. 
</P>
<P>
Well, you're not alone. We of the National Assn. of Grenade Owners are working 
for the decriminalization and legalization of hand grenades for personal use -- 
hunting, fishing and self-defense. 
</P>
<P>
In conjunction with the AACLU (Americans Against Civil Liberties and Unions), 
we've been advancing our cause through billboards, matchbook covers and 
intimidation of congressional leaders. (By the way, we've recently changed the 
name of our legislative influence-peddling group from the grenade lobby to the 
grenade lob. It's shorter and punchier.) 
</P>
<P>
We feel good about the use of grenades, but because they're illegal, we 
God-fearing, law-abiding, patriotic citizens are considered outlaws. 
</P>
<P>
Now the anti-gun nuts want to take away our AK-47 assault rifles, which is 
blatant discrimination against us sportsmen with bad eyesight. (That's why I 
use grenades -- I mean, that's why I would use them if they weren't against the 
law.) 
</P>
<P>
So, in order to keep ourselves in the news and keep those checks flowing into 
headquarters, we're broadening our cause beyond grenades, to include the right 
to semi-automatic weapons and to fight these fanatics who want to restrict our 
rights even further. 
</P>
<P>
It's not just sportsmen I'm speaking on behalf of. Grenades are quite effective 
as well for termite work and preparing your vegetable garden. And a lot of us 
just like to collect them. Just as we like to collect AK-47 rifles. Stamps and 
coins are for kids. 
</P>
<P>
The National Assn. of Grenade Owners supports the right of free men to bear 
armaments. We oppose any restriction against AK-47 rifles, and we support the 
legalization of hand grenades. 
</P>
<P>
We don't want to break the law. We just want to write it. 
</P>
