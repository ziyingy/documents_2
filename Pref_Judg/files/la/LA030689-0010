Elephant herds, cut to a fraction of their former size by poachers and 
trigger-happy Ugandan soldiers, will be wiped out soon if current losses 
continue, according to a Ugandan conservation expert.

Eric Edroma, director of the Uganda Institute of Ecology, said Saturday that 
only 1,500 to 2,000 remain of the 20,000 elephants that roamed Uganda in the 
1960s.

Most of the losses occurred in the 1970s when dictator Idi Amin's soldiers 
killed the animals indiscriminately. Losses of elephants and other animals 
continued on a large scale in some areas after Amin was overthrown in 1979.

Edroma said rebels are killing an estimated 10 to 15 elephants a month in the 
Murchison Falls National Park in northern Uganda. The authorities believe ivory 
from the tusks is being smuggled out through Zaire and Sudan, with the proceeds 
used by rebel groups to buy arms and ammunition.
