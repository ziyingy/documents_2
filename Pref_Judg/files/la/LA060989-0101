Despite heroic efforts from several passers-by, two infants died and two other 
children were injured in a fast-moving fire that gutted a licensed family 
day-care center Thursday morning in Huntington Beach. 
</P>
<P>
"I had nothing but a hose," said Dennis Drew, who frantically sprayed water at 
the home's flaming front door before firefighters arrived. "The lady was 
screaming and yelling that there were children in there, but you couldn't 
breathe and you couldn't see and you couldn't touch anything . . . Even the 
firemen, when they came out, started crying after seeing those babies." 
</P>
<P>
Fire officials, who found no smoke detectors in the rubble, believe the blaze 
may have been caused by a faulty television set. 
</P>
<P>
The dead infants were identified as Jessica Jordan of Huntington Beach, who 
would have been 8 months old today, and 13-month-old John H. Reilly IV, 
according to fire officials and relatives of the children. 
</P>
<P>
Jessica's mother, Susan Jordan, burst into tears after fire officials at the 
scene told her about her daughter's death. "Oh, my God!" she screamed as crisis 
intervention workers escorted her to a van. 
</P>
<P>
John H. Reilly III, the father of the 13-month-old, stared in disbelief at the 
charred home at 5122 Audrey Drive when he arrived there Thursday evening. 
</P>
<P>
"He was our only child," said Reilly, his eyes filling with tears. "I can't 
believe it happened. How can something like this happen so quickly?" 
</P>
<P>
Of the other two children at the home, Devon Strayer, 3, of Huntington Beach, 
was treated at Humana Hospital and released, while Nick Duncan, 6 months, 
remained hospitalized at UCI Medical Center in Orange with second- and 
third-degree burns, said Martha Werth, a public information officer for the 
Huntington Beach Fire Department. 
</P>
<P>
The day-care provider, Pat Orozco, 49, was hospitalized in fair condition with 
smoke inhalation and second-degree burns on her arms and shoulders. Also 
hospitalized for smoke inhalation were Huntington Beach firefighter Chris 
Gruber and Bill Applebee, a Huntington Beach water department employee who 
tried to rescue the children from the burning house. 
</P>
<P>
Fire officials are investigating reports that the fire may have started in one 
of two television sets in the home, said Tom Huntley, an investigator with the 
Huntington Beach Fire Department's fire prevention bureau. 
</P>
<P>
"There are no statements to show that there was any negligence in this fire," 
Huntley said. "Everything we have shows that it is an accidental fire." 
</P>
<P>
Huntley said investigators have found no evidence of smoke alarms in the house, 
though there may have been a fire extinguisher in the kitchen. 
</P>
<P>
Under state day-care licensing requirements, providers who baby-sit up to six 
children have the option of equipping their homes with either smoke detectors 
or fire extinguishers, said Dianne M. Edwards, director of adult and employment 
services for the Orange County Social Services Agency. 
</P>
<P>
However, the state building code requires family day-care providers to have 
both fire extinguishers and smoke detectors, said Steve Viero, supervisor of 
field operations for the state fire marshal. Viero could not explain why the 
two codes differ, or whose responsibility it is to enforce the smoke-detector 
requirement. 
</P>
<P>
In an interview from her bed at Long Beach Memorial Hospital, Orozco said she 
was coming out of the kitchen and entering the living room when she turned 
around and saw the fire. Orozco said she grabbed two children and took them 
outside but was unable to get back into the house to retrieve the other two. 
</P>
<P>
"The flames were overwhelming," she said. 
</P>
<P>
Asked if she knew how the fire started or where the flames were coming from, 
Orozco just weakly shook her head. 
</P>
<P>
"It's all kind of blank right now," she said. "I did my best." 
</P>
<P>
Witnesses said Orozco ran from the house with a child in her arms after the 
fire broke out at 9:56 a.m. 
</P>
<P>
"She was going crazy," said Kevin Mohl, 26, a Huntington Beach resident who 
happened to be driving by the stucco house. "She was trying to get the babies 
out. She was going into hysterics." 
</P>
<P>
Both of the children were found dead in a back room, Werth said, Jessica on the 
floor and John in a crib. Fire officials speculated that Orozco might have 
tried to carry Jessica from a nearby swing but ended up dropping the child and 
losing her in the thick smoke. 
</P>
<P>
Volunteer therapists coordinated by the American Red Cross spent about 15 
minutes with Susan and Donald Jordan, Jessica's parents, before the couple 
emerged from a white van to look at Orozco's house. Wrapped in a white blanket, 
Susan Jordan sat on the curb across the street from Orozco's house, her 
husband's arm wrapped around one shoulder. The couple then went inside a 
neighbor's house and left the fire scene several hours later. 
</P>
<P>
"Sometimes they just need to be held and have a shoulder to cry on," said Linda 
M. Johnson, a licensed family therapist from Huntington Beach who helped 
console the distraught Susan Jordan. "Once the shock ends, then the grief 
begins. This is the beginning for them, not the end." 
</P>
<P>
A fund for all the families involved in the fire has been set up by the 
Mortgage Network of Anaheim, which is Susan Jordan's employer. 
</P>
<P>
Before 11 fire units arrived from Huntington Beach and Westminster, several 
people tried to dash into the burning house to rescue the children. Among them 
was Applebee, who doused himself with a hose and tried to search a room at the 
back of the house where the fire is believed to have started. 
</P>
<P>
"He went in and got three or four stuffed animals out, then the roof 
collapsed," said David Hansen, 25, an Arrowhead Water employee who assisted in 
the rescue attempt. 
</P>
<P>
Orozco's mother, Lillian Brazamontes of Westminster, said her daughter had been 
baby-sitting children for about 15 years. However, it was not until last year 
that she applied for a family day-care license, Edwards said. 
</P>
<P>
There are about 2,400 licensed family day-care facilities in Orange County, 
Edwards said. There are hundreds of unlicensed homes that county social workers 
investigate whenever they receive reports of them. 
</P>
<P>
Following up on such a tip, inspector Tiia Mikkelsaar visited Orozco's home 
unannounced on April 30, 1987, and determined that at least three children were 
being cared for, according to agency records. 
</P>
<P>
Orozco was not home at the time, but her mother told the inspector that she 
would relay the information to her daughter. 
</P>
<P>
When Mikkelsaar returned to the home six weeks later, Orozco had attended a 
two-hour orientation course for family day-care providers and taken out an 
application for a license. 
</P>
<P>
She was given a license to care for up to six children on March 14, 1988. The 
licenses are valid for three years, and each home must be inspected before a 
license is renewed. Orozco's home had no outstanding deficiencies or 
complaints, and her file showed no recurring problems, Edwards said. 
</P>
<P>
When Mikkelsaar visited Orozco's home the day the license was issued, she noted 
in her report that Orozco had put a fire extinguisher in her kitchen to correct 
one of several deficiencies that were noted during an earlier inspection. 
</P>
<P>
The only complaint the agency received against Orozco came about a year ago 
from parents who said their infant had developed a skin infection at the 
day-care home. When Mikkelsaar investigated, she found no problems at the home, 
and Orozco said the complaint was probably made by a couple who had withdrawn 
their child from her care after he developed diaper rash, said Susan Martinez, 
county supervisor of day-care licensing. 
</P>
<P>
Orozco said the couple filed the complaint against her because they owed her 
money. Orozco was suing them in small claims court, Martinez said. 
</P>
<P>
Martinez said that when she was an inspector, she used to advise family 
day-care providers to put smoke detectors in their home rather than relying 
solely on fire extinguishers for safety. 
</P>
<P>
"It's not easy watching six children," Martinez said. "And yet we get a lot of 
flak about the limits we place on them (day-care providers)."
