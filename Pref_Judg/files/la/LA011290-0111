A North Hollywood woman was sentenced Thursday to a year in jail and three 
years probation for drunk driving that killed a 49-year-old Sherman Oaks woman 
last year. 
</P>
<P>
Van Nuys Superior Court Judge Michael B. Farrell listened to impassioned 
testimony from the family of the accident victim, Mary Kay Chaleff, before 
sentencing Cheryl Lynn Ewell, 26, on one count each of hit-and-run and drunk 
driving. 
</P>
<P>
Chaleff's three sons, Michael, Andrew, and Daniel, said they forgive Ewell for 
the April 8 accident but asked the judge to send a message to the community by 
giving Ewell a jail sentence. 
</P>
<P>
Ewell's attorney, Andrew R. Willing, asked that Ewell be sentenced to a work 
furlough program or put under house arrest because she has no prior criminal 
record. 
</P>
<P>
Deputy Dist. Atty. Robert Dver pointed out that Ewell not only caused a death, 
but also fled the scene of the accident. Los Angeles police, who arrested 
Ewell, said she leaped from her car and hid in bushes until a witness persuaded 
her to return to the intersection where the accident had occurred. 
</P>
<P>
She faced a maximum term of four years in jail, Dver said. 
</P>
<P>
Ewell had a blood-alcohol level of 0.1%, the legal standard then for 
intoxication, when she struck Chaleff's car at Addison Street and Woodman 
Avenue.
