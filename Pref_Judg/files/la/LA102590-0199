<P>
La Coupole restaurant is jammed and, what with the noise and the difficulty of 
troweling just the right amount of pate onto my grilled bread, I'm having a 
hard time making out what Dr. Jacques Richard is saying. Richard, the reigning 
authority on heart disease rates in France, has his own problems. He can't seem 
to decide whether he wants yet another bite of lardons, the fatty bacon chunks 
that adorn his salad, or whether he should move on to the gooey, golden yolk of 
his poached egg. 
</P>
<P>
Contrary to appearances, this is work. I've crossed the ocean to untangle a 
mystery, and if anyone can help, it's Richard. The question is best put as a 
riddle: Of the Western world's industrialized countries, which has the lowest 
rate of death from heart disease? 
</P>
<P>
Oui. C'est la France. The United States isn't even close. In France each year, 
143 of every 100,000 middle-aged men die of heart disease, according to the 
World Health Organization. In the United States, that figure is more than twice 
as high: 315. French women do even better, with the world's lowest rate of 
death from heart disease. 
</P>
<P>
If you look at all industrialized countries, only Japan beats France. Japan's 
good health is no surprise, since the Japanese diet is light on fat and heavy 
on rice and fish. But despite their bad habits the French seem to be thriving. 
</P>
<P>
How could it be, I'd come to ask Richard, that while Americans are dutifully 
downing bran muffins and the French are happily polishing off every butter 
flake of their croissants, they have healthier hearts than we do? This is, 
after all, the country that conceived bearnaise sauce -- three egg yolks and 
half a pound of butter -- and then thought to pour it over filet mignon. 
</P>
<P>
Richard, an epidemiologist, has spent 25 years compiling and verifying the 
figures. Their message is clear: The French should be having heart attacks 
everywhere you look. They're not. And French women actually outlive American 
women by a year. 
</P>
<P>
Richard, a researcher at INSERM, the French equivalent of our National 
Institutes of Health, is tall and thin, friendly, in a shy way, and 
extravagantly polite. He speaks quietly, almost apologizing as he replies to my 
nasty-minded question. 
</P>
<P>
Maybe the French diagnose heart disease in some funny way that pretties up 
their statistics? No, he says, skeptics have checked and rechecked French death 
certificates, reworking the figures to include all the fuzzy diagnoses that 
just might have been heart disease deaths, and the same picture always emerges. 
</P>
<P>
Maybe some regions of France have high rates of heart disease but ride the 
coattails of regions that are especially healthy? I'm wondering about Normandy, 
famous for its butter and cream, and Richard grants me an indulgent smile. 
</P>
<P>
"Yes, Normandy is doing poorly relative to France, but it's doing well" -- he 
pauses a moment trying vainly to come up with a delicate way to frame the 
comparison -- "but it's doing well relative to you." 
</P>
<P>
Another prominent French epidemiologist, Serge Renaud, had cackled cheerfully 
when I'd asked him about heart disease in different parts of France. "Do you 
know who has the lowest rate of death from heart disease in all of France?" he 
had asked me. "The least heart disease is in southwest France. That's the place 
where they have duck fat instead of butter, where they eat foie gras." 
</P>
<P>
As I sit at dinner, sipping my vintage Sauternes, Richard gestures toward the 
pinkish slab of pate on my plate. "That's fat," he warns. "Not so good for 
you." Then, with a conspiratorial grin as he indicates my wine glass. "You'd 
better drink your wine for protection." 
</P>
<P>
Richard may be joking, but it's not entirely a joke. One study after another 
has found that moderate wine drinkers -- those who drink about two glasses per 
day -- have far less heart disease than either teetotalers or heavy drinkers. 
Eight studies in the 1970s and 1980s, in the United States and abroad, reported 
that moderate drinkers had between 30% and 40% less heart disease than control 
subjects. 
</P>
<P>
Still another study looked at 18 countries and found "a strong and specific 
negative association between heart disease deaths and wine consumption." A 
chart spelled out the message: Finland, the United States and Scotland were in 
a group that drank the least wine and had the most deaths from heart disease: 
Belgium, West Germany and Austria drank more wine and had fewer deaths; 
Switzerland, Italy and France drank the most wine and had the fewest deaths. 
</P>
<P>
If wine should prove to have some ingredient that protects against heart 
disease, the authors concluded, "we consider it almost a sacrilege that this 
constituent should be isolated . . . the medicine is already in a highly 
palatable form." 
</P>
<P>
"Ah, Roquefort," Richard sighs. I've been inquiring about his customary diet, 
and he's been recalling the previous evening's after-dinner cheese at home. 
Richard is not a rhapsodic fellow -- he spends his days pondering mortality 
tables and calculating correlation coefficients -- but the contemplation of 
cheese seems to induce a brief reverie. 
</P>
<P>
He's hardly alone in that enthusiasm. Cheese shops are everywhere in France. 
The tiny, immaculate fromagerie nearest my hotel was always jammed with 
customers who brought to their marketing a seriousness that Americans might 
reserve for an art gallery. 
</P>
<P>
The French eat about 40 pounds of cheese per person each year, compared with 
about half that amount in the United States. That makes it all the more 
perplexing that France ranks so low in heart disease. Cheese is higher in 
cholesterol and saturated fat than even beef or pork. 
</P>
<P>
One of the best known of the anti-cheese preachers is William Connor, a doctor 
and a highly regarded nutritionist at Oregon Health Sciences University. 
Connor, engaged in a study of heart disease in 40 countries, has been analyzing 
the relationship between different countries' consumption of dairy fat -- milk, 
butter, cheese, and so on -- and their rate of heart disease. As he had 
expected, he found the higher the intake of dairy fat, the higher the rate of 
heart disease. It holds for cream, butter and milk, but there's yet to be shown 
any correlation between how much cheese a country eats and how much heart 
disease it has. That sounds like a cue to break out the party hats to me, but 
Connor dismisses his own finding. 
</P>
<P>
"Cheese is an awfully expensive food," he says, "and the amount of cheese 
consumed was probably too low for a correlation to show up." 
</P>
<P>
But Serge Renaud, an epidemiologist based in Lyon, has just visited Connor's 
lab and thinks Connor has given cheese a bad rap. "Even if you look only at 
countries that eat a lot of cheese, you see the same discrepancy," he says. 
"We've seen for years that if you want to get a nice correlation between dairy 
fat and heart disease in different countries, then you've got to remove the 
cheese." 
</P>
<P>
The theory is that calcium neutralizes fat by combining with it so that both 
are excreted rather than absorbed. Curiously, researchers studying the entirely 
different problem of colon cancer have come to similar, though tentative, 
conclusion: Their patients seemed to benefit by supplementing their diet with 
calcium, presumably because it helped neutralize the cancer-promoting fat. 
</P>
<P>
But if calcium makes cheese OK, shouldn't regular whole milk be OK too? It's 
not -- Renaud agrees with nutritionists' "steer clear" warnings -- and he 
concedes he has no real answer to the question. He suspects that whole milk 
promotes heart disease because the calcium binds not to fat, as in cheese, but 
to protein, leaving the fat free to be efficiently absorbed. 
</P>
<P>
In the meantime, cheese remains on every American nutritionist's warning list, 
but not on Renaud's. "It's better to have cheeses that are lower in fat, like 
goat cheese, and these we don't forbid," he says. "First of all, cheese has a 
taste that cannot be replaced by anything else. And secondly, it's not as 
damaging as other things." 
</P>
<P>
Richard sees me looking longingly at our empty bread basket and orders us a 
refill. All around us, diners are gulping down oysters and digging into sea 
urchins and carving up cotes de boeuf. In this tableau of indulgence, the sole 
image of restraint comes from a thin young woman seated at the table next to 
me. A waiter has just brought her dinner: a single spear of asparagus perfectly 
centered on the plate and adorned with one large dab of hollandaise sauce. 
</P>
<P>
The food on all sides has given me a chance to trot out the multifarious 
explanations I'd been given for France's good health. The authorities I'd 
talked to had all proposed pet theories, many of them temptingly tidy, and I 
was sure Richard would know what to make of them. 
</P>
<P>
Hugh Tunstall-Pedoe, the British epidemiologist, had placed a lot of weight on 
the quality of French fruits and vegetables. 
</P>
<P>
"The thing that fascinates me about the French is that they shop for fresh 
produce every day," Tunstall-Pedoe had said. "The French treat food with 
enormous respect, and their methods of cooking don't seem to damage it to the 
extent that other culinary traditions do." 
</P>
<P>
The rate of death from heart disease in Scotland is triple the rate in France. 
"The Scots overcook their vegetables -- they stew them," Tunstall-Pedoe had 
said, "and there's a proportion of Scots who eat no fresh fruit at all. 
</P>
<P>
"If -- and this is a big if -- if the anti-oxidant theory is correct," 
Tunstall-Pedoe had told me, "that could tie everything together." Anti-oxidant 
theory? The idea, he explained, is that unstable molecules called free radicals 
maraud around our bodies, in this case damaging fat-carrying particles in the 
blood so they more easily inflict injury on artery walls. The anti-oxidants, 
including certain vitamins and minerals in fresh fruits and vegetables that 
might not survive lengthy cooking, may help neutralize those raiders. 
</P>
<P>
But when I run that suggestion by Richard, he responds with a bemused shrug, a 
resigned sigh. "Perhaps," he allows. "We cannot say." We settle into a pattern. 
I present Richard with some researcher's explanation of France's good health, 
he listens attentively, judiciously considers the matter over a sip of wine and 
then dodges the question. This is a man who would not jump to a conclusion if 
his house were on fire and rescuers were waiting on the ground with nets. 
</P>
<P>
I ask about the theory that the French diet is actually far more healthful than 
the stereotype would have it. "The French eat more vegetables and grains and 
beans than a lot of the rest of the world, and, of course, they're famous bread 
eaters," is what I'd heard from Sonja Connor, a dietitian at Oregon Health 
Sciences University. 
</P>
<P>
I'd heard a related theory from a colleague of Connor's. "The eating habits of 
the French are totally different from here," Sabine Artaud-Wild had told me. 
Artaud-Wild is a French-born dietitian who has been in the United States for 35 
years. "Desserts and the sauces you hear so much about are for special 
occasions," she'd said. "Everyday dessert is cheese and fruit. Portions are 
much smaller, and it's drilled into the French people that you eat at mealtimes 
and not in between." 
</P>
<P>
Richard listens patiently to my paraphrase of those remarks, then says, "Well, 
yes. But we are also eating some things that are not so good." He allows 
himself a tiny, wry smile. 
</P>
<P>
Sausages, for instance. Paris is dotted with charcuteries, heralded by wooden 
signs in the shape of pigs. I'd spent some time wandering through these shops, 
as fascinated and appalled as a small-town minister in Times Square. There were 
sausages of every description and some beyond description. So much for the 
theory that rich and fatty French food is for tourists and real French citizens 
subsist on carrot sticks and mineral water. 
</P>
<P>
But the French diet contains still another mystery. The French consume almost 
as many calories as Americans do, but they look skinnier. I ask Richard whether 
Americans really are fatter. It's unfair, I realize, to make such a pleasant 
man choose between politeness and honesty, but I can't resist. 
</P>
<P>
"When you go to the United States, you are very surprised," he begins, 
gingerly. Then, as his memories grow more vivid, he extends his hands in front 
of him, facing each other, then moves them farther and farther apart, as if 
gauging the size of a pair of great, waddling hips. "What is possible to see in 
France," he says, his hands now about a yard apart, "is usual in the United 
States." He seems momentarily shaken. 
</P>
<P>
Richard also gives the notion of stress, or lack of it, some credence. "In the 
United States," he says, squeezing his eyes shut and clenching his fists like a 
man in a headache commercial, "there is much more pressure." It's certainly 
true that the five-week vacation is a rite of French life and that at my 
customary walking pace I'd kept whipping past French amblers who seemed to have 
no destination at all. But it's hard to buy the stress theory. 
</P>
<P>
Japan, after all, has by far the lowest rate of death from heart disease in the 
industrialized world, and the Japanese are hardly lounging in hammocks and 
gazing at sunsets. And in both Japan and France, the suicide rate, which ought 
to be at least a rough barometer of stress, is far higher than the U.S. rate. 
</P>
<P>
Nor does exercise seem a likely explanation for France's healthy hearts. And it 
seems unlikely that the French share any hereditary traits that might protect 
them. France has been invaded and colonized from all directions for thousands 
of years and its population is hardly homogeneous. 
</P>
<P>
Dessert arrives and interrupts my questioning. Richard and I have both ordered 
oeufs a la neige -- islands of egg white floating on a vast, yellow ocean of 
egg yolks and sugar and milk. The table looks as if the American Heart Assn. 
has come to shoot a horror film. 
</P>
<P>
"So I shouldn't switch to rich cheeses and cream sauces and butter and pate?" 
</P>
<P>
It's the first of my questions that gets a rise out of Richard. He replies in a 
rat-a-tat-tat of dismay, like rain on a tin roof. 
</P>
<P>
"No, no, no, no, no! We do not yet know what is the answer, but it is not 
that." 
</P>
<P>
Richard reflects a moment, then smiles faintly. "Perhaps it is the sky, or the 
light over France," he suggests, and we lift our wine glass in melancholy 
tribute to the abiding distinction in our fates. He lives here. 
</P>
<P>
I have to go back. 
</P>
