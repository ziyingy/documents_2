A solar eclipse occurs when the moon moves between the sun and Earth, briefly 
blocking part or all of the sun's light. A partial eclipse will occur on the 
morning of March 7 and will be visible in Southern California. 
</P>
<P>
As seen from Los Angeles, the eclipse will begin at 8:55 a.m. and end at 10:47 
a.m. At maximum, which occurs at 9:50 a.m., 36% of the sun's image will be 
obscured by the moon, according to the Griffith Observatory. 
</P>
<P>
Because this is a partial eclipse, the sky will not darken noticeably, but the 
right equipment can provide a better look at this rare phenomenon. Griffith 
Observatory will be open from 8:30 a.m. until noon on March 7 so that the 
public can view the eclipse through the observatory's solar telescopes. 
</P>
<P>
Do not look directly at the sun during the partial eclipse, because such 
exposure can damage the eyes.
