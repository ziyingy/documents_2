No charges will be brought against a San Diego police officer who was operating 
a four-wheel-drive vehicle that crashed Aug. 31 on Interstate 8 in El Centro, 
killing three passengers, the Imperial County district attorney said Thursday.

Kevin Rausis, 28, a seven-year San Diego police veteran, was cleared of any 
wrongdoing in the accident after Dist. Atty. Larry Smith reviewed California 
Highway Patrol blood-alcohol and accident-collision reports sent to his office 
Wednesday. Rausis' blood-alcohol specimen measured 0.01% alcohol by weight, 
according to a spokeswoman for the CHP. If Rausis' blood-alcohol exceeded 
0.10%, the limit allow by California law, he could have faced felony charges of 
drunk driving and vehicular manslaughter.

Smith said the reports indicated Rausis was not under the influence, and there 
was no evidence of excessive speed.

"He may have been negligent, but there was no criminal culpability," said 
Smith, referring to Rausis' account of adjusting the tape player when the 
accident occurred.

Embarking on a hunting trip, Rausis reportedly swerved to avoid a slower-moving 
eastbound car when his Toyota 4-Runner overturned. Killed in the crash were 
Rausis' brother, Kenneth Richard Rausis, 38, of University City, his 
brother-in-law, John Leonard Walker, 27, of East San Diego and Michael Walker, 
40, who died two days later from injuries suffered in the one-car accident.

Suspicion of alcohol involvement stemmed from an ice chest containing beer that 
was reportedly scattered across I-8 after Rausis' car overturned.

Rausis, who was back to work with the traffic unit Tuesday, was unavailable for 
comment.
