Exxon will spread fertilizer on oil-soaked Alaskan beaches in a test effort to 
accelerate the growth of natural bacteria that break down toxic hydrocarbons 
from oil, the Environmental Protection Agency said. Under an agreement with the 
EPA, Exxon will apply nitrogen and phosphorous to about two acres of beach 
along the southern shore of Snug Harbor on Knight Island, one of the areas of 
Prince William Sound hardest hit by the 11 million gallons of oil spilled by 
the supertanker Exxon Valdez on March 24. The nitrogen and phosphorus are 
nutrients intended to stimulate the growth of native microorganisms in the 
sound that "eat" certain toxic elements of the spilled crude oil. The 
experiment, which is to begin Thursday, could result in the breakdown of toxic 
hydrocarbons within two to three years rather than the five- to 10-year period 
required under normal circumstances, said Dick Valentinetti of EPA's Office of 
Research and Development.
