Increasingly, the arbitrary nature of political boundaries is being exposed as 
the region's 168-and-counting municipalities and special districts continue to 
grow and crowd each other. 
</P>
<P>
The result is that regionalism is beginning to be taken seriously as a concept 
of government to deal with the critical problems of air pollution, water 
quality, traffic congestion, waste disposal, growth management and the 
jobs-housing balance. 
</P>
<P>
And that is no joke for this April Fool's Day. 
</P>
<P>
For years, mentioning regionalism in planning, development and political 
circles, entwined as they are like an Olympic symbol, was sure to generate 
snickers and laughs. "Local government give up some of its approval powers? 
You've got to be kidding," the pundits would say. 
</P>
<P>
But it has become apparent that the growing list of problems affecting the 
region's quality of life is simply beyond the grasp of local governments. 
</P>
<P>
And it is equally apparent that the various attempts to handle them so far on a 
county level have resulted in a bureaucratic gridlock that matches our traffic 
gridlock. 
</P>
<P>
At the wheel in the middle of the mess has been a somnolent state. 
</P>
<P>
We are not talking simply political theory here. This is about how government 
works, and doesn't work. 
</P>
<P>
For example, when Los Angeles County recently proposed to relieve rush-hour 
congestion on a major boulevard by simply synchronizing traffic signals, it 
found that the 75 signals involved were in nine cities, and that a few of the 
cities didn't want them changed because it would inconvenience a few of their 
residents. 
</P>
<P>
Or consider the continuing, nasty battle between the county Transportation 
Commission and the Southern California Rapid Transit District over the design 
and construction of rail projects. 
</P>
<P>
The action of the agencies has been described as "two hogs pushing each other 
away from the trough." They are spending millions in lawsuits against each 
other while squeezing dimes out of bus riders. 
</P>
<P>
Then there is the current controversy over the Marina Place Mall proposed on a 
sliver of Culver City at the northeast corner of Washington and Lincoln 
boulevards, surrounded on three sides by Los Angeles. Culver City would get the 
taxes and Venice the traffic, so Los Angeles is rightfully complaining. 
</P>
<P>
However, when Culver City complained a few years ago about a proposed mall a 
block away on Maxella Avenue just within the boundaries of Los Angeles, it was 
ignored. The mall has since been built, dumping traffic in Culver City. So 
turns the screw. 
</P>
<P>
These protracted conflicts between jurisdictions were ruefully noted in the Los 
Angeles 2000 report issued last year. 
</P>
<P>
To begin facing up to these conflicts, L.A. 2000 recommended a metropolitan 
growth management agency to set policy and provide guidelines for developments 
"with area-wide impacts." Also recommended was a metropolitan environmental 
quality agency. They were the first shots in this latest barrage on behalf of 
regionalism. 
</P>
<P>
Soon after, the South Coast Air Quality Management District (AQMD), the one 
governmental body at present empowered to make binding regional decisions, 
issued a bold plan to deal with smog. The plan establishes a strict set of 
anti-pollution standards and a timetable for their implementation. Special 
districts and special interests squealed. 
</P>
<P>
"What we are doing is overlaying local government with a set of constraints, 
not obliterating it," said AQMD executive officer James Lents. 
</P>
<P>
However, the AQMD has recognized that its goals will not be met if the region 
does not begin dealing realistically with traffic and growth issues. 
</P>
<P>
This point also was emphasized in a recent Southern California Assn. of 
Governments report. Its concerns are prologues to a proposed state proposition 
(No. 111 on the June ballot), tying transportation to land-use planning within 
a regional framework. 
</P>
<P>
"Let's face it," said Lents in a recent interview, "environmental and 
transportation problems are making regional government a reality. The question 
is not whether we will eventually have a regional government, but rather how 
extensive it will be." 
</P>
<P>
These are questions on the agenda of the recently established Lewis Center for 
Regional Studies at UCLA. The hope is that the center will not become yet 
another self-serving academic exercise, benefitting just the administrators and 
professors involved, and actually wade into the political muck composed of 
local and special interest groups where policy and public opinion is formed. 
</P>
<P>
"We intend to be attentive and make a difference," promised the center's Allen 
Scott, a geographer. 
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, an interesting experiment in the nitty-gritty aspects of regionalism 
has been launched by the less academic and more reality-oriented UCLA Extension 
public policy program, headed by LeRoy Graymer. He is serving as facilitator to 
a landmark attempt by five Westside cities to coordinate traffic and growth 
management efforts affecting each other. 
</P>
<P>
Putting these actions in a broader perspective, and stirring the hearts of 
regionalists, was a report a few months ago by the California Assembly Office 
of Research, entitled "Getting Ahead of the Growth Curve." 
</P>
<P>
The report cited the ineffectiveness of an array of governmental entities to 
deal with a range of issues, including air and water quality and traffic. The 
report concluded with a call for management on a regional level. 
</P>
<P>
Soon after, Assembly Speaker Willie Brown introduced a bill, AB 4242, that 
would merge various air and water quality boards and transportation planning 
agencies into seven distinct regional governing bodies across the state. 
</P>
<P>
The Los Angeles region would consist of Los Angeles, Orange, Riverside, San 
Bernardino, Ventura and Imperial counties. Although the bill is not given much 
of a chance of passage at this time, it is seen as a sort of feather in the 
wind to test the political sentiments for regionalism. 
</P>
<P>
Besides the traditional distrust of regionalism by conservatives and home-rule 
advocates, there is now the issue of emerging minority politics. 
</P>
<P>
"Unfortunately, regionalism is rising just at a time when politically active 
ethnics are getting a local foothold," observed Alan Kreditor, dean of USC's 
School of Urban and Regional Planning. He expressed the concern that 
regionalism would sap local vitality. 
</P>
<P>
Kreditor also commented that the assembly report, and the bill, were in effect 
admissions by the Legislature that the increasing problems associated with 
growth cannot be solved on the state level, and that it was proposing a new 
level of government, the region, to abdicate its responsibility. 
</P>
<P>
Regionalism is no longer a joke; but then again neither is the condition of our 
air and water, our waste disposal methods, the lack of housing and a decent 
public education system, traffic and generally our diminishing quality of life. 
</P>
