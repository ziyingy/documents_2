Swofford said that three pickup trucks drove across the border through a hole 
in a fence about half a mile west of the port of entry. Two of the trucks 
returned to Mexico, but the 1974 pickup going about 55 m.p.h. led Border Patrol 
officers on a chase from Otay Mesa Road to Airway Road.

Swofford said that Vargas was at a stoplight on Airway Road about 7:40 p.m., 
attempting to make an illegal left turn, when he broadsided a Ford Mustang. 
Vargas was arrested shortly after he and two of the people fled on foot.
