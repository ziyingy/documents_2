About 60 employees and patrons were evacuated Thursday from Santa Ana's 
recently reopened Central Library after laboratory tests detected asbestos in a 
closed-off section of the building. 
</P>
<P>
The 30-year-old, marble-decorated library reopened Monday after two weeks of 
asbestos removal. 
</P>
<P>
Workers had barricaded the rear section of the building and removed floor 
tiles, which contained asbestos. 
</P>
<P>
Library director Rob Richard said that air samples in the library showed no 
sign of asbestos. But further tests found asbestos in mastic, a glue that was 
originally used to set the library's tiles in place. The tile glue was not 
removed during the cleanup. 
</P>
<P>
Richard said he decided to close the library about 5 p.m. as a "precautionary 
step." 
</P>
<P>
There was little chance of the asbestos getting into the air, because workers 
did not heat the glue or use any solvents to remove the tile from its setting, 
said city official Don Rose, who is in charge of handling occupational-hazard 
problems. 
</P>
<P>
"The closure was to eliminate any possible exposure to asbestos," Rose said. 
</P>
<P>
Richard said that the library will remain closed for another week until the 
glue is removed. 
</P>

The 240,000-volume library is undergoing a $1.6-million renovation. The project 
includes a new children's wing, more bookshelves and a reorganization of book 
selections. A new main entrance will also be built at the south end of the 
library, which is now its rear wing. 
</P>
<P>
The library had previously been closed for about a month during the renovation. 
</P>
<P>
The new asbestos problem will not delay the opening of the library's new 
children's wing in January, Richard said.
