<P>
Very low-calorie diets present a bit of a logistical problem for individuals 
who are also concerned about good bone health. 
</P>
<P>
While dairy foods are viewed as the best dietary source of calcium -- a vital 
component in bone mass maintenance -- they are typically perceived by dieters 
as too high in fat to be worth their calcium merit. 
</P>
<P>
This aversion to dairy products may be responsible for the escalating rise in 
osteoporosis in this country, which is the underlying cause of the nation's 1.3 
million bone fractures each year. Of those, 250,000 are fractures of the hip, 
according to the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services. 
</P>
<P>
But the results of a study, conducted at the University of San Diego and 
published last year in the British medical journal Lancet, may underscore the 
importance of dietary calcium in reducing risk for osteoporosis and influence 
calorie-counters who may be avoiding rich sources of the mineral in an attempt 
to lose fat. 
</P>
<P>
At a Dairy Council of California nutrition press conference in Costa Mesa 
recently, Dr. Troy Holbrook, assistant adjunct professor of community and 
family medicine at UCSD, described calcium as estrogen's pre-menopausal equal 
in preventing hip fractures. Her 14-year study of calcium intake by men and 
women in Rancho Bernardo was the source of this data. 
</P>
<P>
It has been known for some time that women suffer from the bone-thinning 
disease at a disproportionately higher rate than men. And the U.S. Department 
of Health and Human Services estimates that osteoporosis afflicts more than 24 
million Americans each year, more than half of all women in this country older 
than 45 and 90% of those older than 75. 
</P>
<P>
In its classical manifestation, osteoporosis is seen as "a gradual, but 
increasing number of vertebral fractures as the spine begins to collapse on 
itself," said Holbrook. "When the process has progressed far enough, you see a 
decrease in height and the classic spinal hump." 
</P>
<P>
But hip fractures also are common and occur at very high rates among elderly 
white women in this country. Holbrook estimated that by the age of 80, some 
white women have a 1% to 2% annual risk of fracturing their hip. The estimated 
cost of hip fracture treatment alone was $6.1 billion a year in 1984, Holbrook 
said, and as many as one third to one half of those who suffer hip fractures 
never return to a functional level of activity. 
</P>
<P>
As recently as 1987, however, despite all this knowledge, a low-calcium diet 
was still considered only a "proposed risk factor" for osteoporosis, said 
Holbrook, which might explain a nationwide reluctance to meet the requirement 
through dietary sources. 
</P>
<P>
Holbrook's research undertook to establish low calcium intake as a known risk 
factor. This would place it among other established hazards including being 
female, being white, being thin relative to fat, consuming alcohol and certain 
drugs and being a sufferer of rheumatoid arthritis. 
</P>
<P>
Because calcium is withdrawn from the bones (where it is stored) when dietary 
intake is too low, decreased calcium intake was always a strong candidate for 
the risk factor list. The theory was that if during youth, calcium intake is 
increased, a heavier, more dense skeleton might develop. This could protect 
against fractures later in life, researchers surmised. 
</P>
<P>
While there is still considerable debate over the effects of increasing calcium 
in the diet of post-menopausal women -- whether or not it can prevent, or at 
best, retard bone loss without estrogen supplementation -- studies have 
indicated with some certainty that added calcium is of benefit to 
pre-menopausal women. 
</P>
<P>
The UCSD research verified this, reporting that risk could be reduced by as 
much as half. 
</P>
<P>
Based on what the participants in the Holbrook study said they ate during a 
24-hour recall period, she observed a distinct difference in the occurance of 
hip fractures between the low calcium consumers and the high. In both the men 
and the women, the chances of having a hip fracture declined as the intake of 
calcium went up. Her conclusion: Adequate dietary calcium intake is a valuable 
measurement of risk factor for osteoporosis later in life. 
</P>
<P>
"When we did this comparison, the only difference that we saw nutritionally 
between the hip fracture group and the non-hip fracture group was their intake 
of calcium," Holbrook stated. "No other dietary nutrient made any difference in 
men or women. The average level of calcium intake was much lower in those who 
got hip fractures," she explained, adding that the study was based on dietary 
intake and not supplementation. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
A Good Place to Start 
</P>
<P>
From this, Holbook concluded that it is possible to obtain the Recommended 
Dietary Allowance of 1,000 milligrams of calcium a day from low-fat dairy 
sources as well as some others such as fish by making simple changes in eating 
habits. Adding nonfat or low-fat milk, yogurt and cheese to an otherwise 
balanced diet is a good place to start. 
</P>
<P>
"It's not impossible, (to meet the RDA for calcium)," Holbrook said. "You don't 
need to supplement, unless you have some other kind of health problem." 
</P>
<P>
In addition to replacing other mealtime beverages with milk and substituting 
yogurt for ice cream or other high-fat desserts, try using nonfat yogurt in 
place of mayonnaise when making creamy salad dressings, sandwich fillings and 
main dish, fruit or vegetable salads. Plain nonfat yogurt stands in nicely for 
sour cream when topping baked potatoes or when preparing dips, sauces and 
stroganoffs. It provides more calcium, and far fewer grams of fat, cholesterol 
and calories. 
</P>
<P>
One cup of milk provides about 300 milligrams of calcium. Some comparable 
servings of other calcium-rich, but low-fat foods are: one cup fruit-flavored 
low-fat yogurt, one-half cup ricotta cheese, 1 1/2 ounces part-skim mozzarella, 
one-half cup tofu processed with calcium sulfate and three ounces sardines.
