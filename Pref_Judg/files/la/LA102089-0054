As rescuers ever so slowly untangled the dead from the wreckage of an Oakland 
freeway Thursday, clusters of loved ones of the missing gazed up at the ruins 
with agony in their eyes. 
</P>
<P>
"I have hope as long as there are people still working, as long as we know 
there are air pockets up there, I have hope," said Daniel Rubi, whose 
28-year-old son was believed to have been on the Nimitz Freeway when part of it 
collapsed in Tuesday's earthquake. Rubi's son, a father of 8-year-old twin 
boys, had not been heard from since the earthquake struck. 
</P>
<P>
Like other distraught family members and friends of the missing, Rubi was 
bitter that more was not being done. "When we try to get close," he said, "the 
police just say, 'Step back or you will be arrested.' " 
</P>
<P>
The scene Rubi and others so sadly surveyed offered them only more pain. At 
dawn, as a crane lifted out what once had been an Acura automobile, only the 
steering wheel and a human arm could be discerned in the twisted metal. Many 
vehicles had been flattened to a height of only seven inches. Everywhere, there 
were pools of blood and by day's end, the air was filled with the stench of 
death. 
</P>
<P>
"It's unbelievable how (the vehicles) are crushed," said one Oakland policeman. 
"It looks like somebody took some tinfoil, just wadded it up and threw it 
away." 
</P>
<P>
A crew of 200 workers were combing through the rubble Thursday, searching 
without success for survivors and extricating vehicles and bodies. By day's 
end, officials said a total of 18 bodies and 45 vehicles had been recovered. 
Most of the victims in those vehicles were believed to have been rescued 
Tuesday night. Twenty-seven vehicles remained trapped between the two decks of 
the elevated section that had toppled. Oakland Mayor Lionel Wilson said 83 
motorists were believed missing, fewer than initially believed. 
</P>
<P>
Oakland Asst. Fire Chief Andy Stark said 35 of 44 freeway sections involved in 
the collapse had been repeatedly examined for survivors by workers with 
sophisticated detection equipment and by specially trained dogs. The remaining 
nine sections were "pancaked" or so badly mangled that rescuers could not get 
to them. 
</P>
<P>
"We're always hoping for miracles, but I am not confident we are going to find 
anyone else alive," Stark said. 
</P>
<P>
Dan Getreu, a rescuer from the Milpitas Fire Department, said workers used 
"jaws of life" to cut off the tops of vehicles and then lifted out the bodies 
with their hands. It took as long as four hours to remove each victim. Getreu 
removed the bodies of a woman and a little girl from one of the vehicles. The 
little girl, he said, appeared to have been reading a book when the quake 
struck. "It's not difficult except for the emotional part," he said. 
</P>
<P>
The day brought relief for some. Some who had not been heard from since the 
earthquake struck and were believed to have been killed on the freeway suddenly 
appeared. Among them was an Oakland attorney who had been missing for a day and 
a half. He showed up at his City Hall office Thursday, informing co-workers he 
had been sick with the flu. "One by one people are turning up," said Mayor 
Wilson. 
</P>
<P>
Workers with heavy equipment tore at tons of concrete and metal girders on the 
freeway's upper deck, trying to crumble it into small pieces so it could be 
carted away and the vehicles below removed. The 90-foot freeway sections 
weighed 10,000 tons each and could not be dismantled in slabs. Workers 
concentrated first on areas where the cars would be easiest to reach, leaving 
the sections that had completely pancaked to the last. Cranes seven to eight 
stories high lifted off the cars, some still containing bodies. Rescuers said a 
rank odor permeated the rubble. 
</P>
<P>
As on Wednesday, the work proceeded slowly because officials feared too much 
equipment or movement might send the wobbly freeway section crashing to the 
ground. The section had sagged overnight, and pockets between the two decks 
that had been four feet high the day before were only inches apart on Thursday. 
A series of aftershocks might have contributed to the settling, but officials 
said they caused nothing to topple from the rubble. Gasoline and oil leaking 
from the vehicles posed fire hazards. 
</P>
<P>
"It's very dangerous under there," said Oakland Police Sgt. Bob Crawford. "They 
believe it could collapse at any moment." 
</P>
<P>
A team of medical examiners, wearing bright blue overalls and face masks, was 
assigned to each car that was removed to identify the victims. They searched 
through purses and wallets for clues. The bodies were then put in blue body 
bags and wheeled away on stretchers to be taken by ambulance to the morgue. 
Police publicized numbers for people to call for information on their missing 
loved ones. 
</P>
<P>
Ted Landswick and Bob Pratt, two Alameda County prosecutors, stared at the 
mangled freeway as though they were looking for someone. They were. A friend 
was believed trapped inside. "It's all a matter of timing (who got killed), and 
in this case, it's a matter of bad timing," said Pratt. The prosecutors feared 
that a colleague who had left the office to pick up her niece at 5 p.m. on 
Tuesday may have been on the freeway when it collapsed. No one had heard from 
her since. 
</P>
<P>
After waiting all day with no word of his son, Daniel Rubi confronted Mayor 
Wilson at a news conference at the scene. "Mayor, did you know you are directly 
responsible for this tragedy?" Rubi challenged. Police, recognizing Rubi was 
not a member of the media, took him away in a police car. A family member 
explained Rubi was overcome by grief, and police said they expected to release 
him. 
</P>
<P>
Sheila Smith also waited. Three friends had been missing since they left the 
East Bay for Tuesday's World Series game. "We will stay as long as it takes 
until they make us leave," said Smith, who had tried unsuccessfully to get 
through police lines. 
</P>

The wreckage drew more than just families and friends to the industrial 
neighborhood. People with cameras and video recorders came to take pictures and 
tape the carnage. Some watched from nearby rooftops. Members of the 
Revolutionary Communist Party exhorted the 100 spectators to demand to be 
allowed to help and they attacked the government for doing too little. 
Spectators applauded the protesters. 
</P>
<P>
And just as grief drew some, others came for different reasons. Dwight Jones, 
an auto-detailer who lives in nearby San Leandro, was a fortune seeker. He said 
he heard two armored cars had been crushed in the debris and he hoped he would 
find money when the winds kicked up. "I wish the wind would start blowing this 
way," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Entrepreneurs set up hot dog stands and passed out coupons for restaurants and 
Halloween costume stores. Rescuers took naps on cots alongside the freeway, 
using their hard hats to shade their eyes from the bright, warm sun. 
</P>
<P>
Jason Solorio, a rescue worker from the Army Reserve, said in the morning he 
and other rescuers were upset that they could not move more quickly. He said 
they saw several victims who didn't look badly injured. Although no one saw any 
movement or heard voices, rescuers, like the loved ones watching, had clung to 
the hope that someone might still be alive. 
</P>
<P>
From a distance of 25 feet, Solorio saw a couple sitting in the front seat of a 
Honda Prelude. Their eyes were closed. The front end of the car was crushed, 
and its windshield had shattered and caved in, but the top of the car remained 
intact. Solorio said he had wondered if they just might be unconscious. 
</P>

Steel girders were used to reinforce the precarious section, and some officials 
said the excavation was moving more rapidly than it had the first day. But Kyle 
Nelson, a spokesman for the California Department of Transportation, conceded: 
"It's very slow work. It's one section at a time. I've never seen damage this 
massive."
