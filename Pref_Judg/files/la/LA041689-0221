Rep. William E. Dannemeyer's recent letter incorrectly characterized 
"mainstream, professional psychology" as viewing homosexuality "as an acquired 
behavior and even 'perverse' in the clinical sense." 
</P>
<P>
On the issue of homosexuality being an acquired behavior, research indicates 
that sexual orientation develops at a very early age, perhaps by the age of 6 
and certainly by early adolescence. Contrary to Dannemeyer's characterization, 
no consensus about causation has emerged among psychologists. Furthermore, once 
established, homosexual orientation is highly resistant to attempts to change 
it. 
</P>
<P>
In such circumstances -- where sexual orientation is acquired at a very early 
age and subsequent attempts to change are unsuccessful -- it makes little sense 
to argue that homosexual behavior is a choice. On the issue of homosexuality 
being " 'perverse' in the clinical sense," by 1973 accumulated research 
findings from studies comparing homosexuals to heterosexuals on measures of 
psychological adjustment and mental health consistently revealed that there was 
no justification for homosexuality to be labeled a mental disorder. 
</P>
<P>
It was on the basis of the scientific research and clinical experience of its 
members that the American Psychological Assn. stated in 1975 that 
"homosexuality per se implies no impairment in judgment, stability, 
reliability, or general social and vocational capabilities." 
</P>
<P>
When access to human and civil rights is involved, discrimination on the basis 
of stereotypes must not be tolerated by our society. The American Psychological 
Assn. is proud of its history of opposition to such discrimination and will 
continue to support protections for the rights of racial, ethnic and religious 
minorities, women, people with disabilities, children and the elderly, and for 
gay men and lesbians.
