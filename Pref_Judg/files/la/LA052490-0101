The House overwhelmingly passed a major revision of the Clean Air Act late 
Wednesday that includes a precedent-setting pilot program to mandate the sale 
of clean-fueled cars in California. 
</P>
<P>
Tougher than a version already approved by the Senate, the House bill was 
adopted by a vote of 401 to 21. Lawmakers brushed aside the threat of a White 
House veto to include a provision granting extra unemployment insurance to 
workers who lose their jobs as a result of the bill's stricter clean air 
regulations. 
</P>
<P>
A number of other strengthening amendments, including a provision sought by 
California members to tighten regulations on offshore pollution sources such as 
oil platforms, also were adopted by overwhelming votes. The votes came after 
House negotiators forged the last of several key compromises to avert what 
might otherwise have been long and acrimonious floor fights. 
</P>
<P>
The first revision of the nation's clean air laws in 13 years, the omnibus 
legislation would tighten limits on automobile emissions to free all American 
cities of smog within 20 years and impose technological controls on factories 
to reduce the risk of cancer from the chemicals they release. It also, for the 
first time, would strictly regulate emissions from coal-burning power plants 
that cause acid rain. 
</P>
<P>
The bill must still be reconciled with the version passed April 3 by the 
Senate, 89 to 11. But the House's historic action on Wednesday all but assured 
that, after more than a decade of legislative stalemate, new clean air 
legislation will become law this year. 
</P>
<P>
"The House has listened to the will of the people rather than the special 
interests. The House bill is better than the Senate's," said Daniel Weiss, a 
lobbyist for the Sierra Club. "Now we've got the makings of a masterpiece in 
conference, but it will all depend on whether we can put the right pieces 
together," he added. 
</P>
<P>
Like the Senate bill, the House measure is largely the product of a series of 
hard-won, complex compromises bridging decade-old divisions among 
environmental, economic and regional interests. 
</P>
<P>
Unlike the Senate bill, however, the House version contains stronger provisions 
on clean-fueled cars, stationary sources of smog and offshore oil pollution. 
</P>
<P>
"We got a good, strong bill . . . a bill with teeth that will force a real 
reduction in the pollution that hurts people's health and damages the 
environment," said Rep. Henry A. Waxman (D-Los Angeles). He, along with Rep. 
John D. Dingell (D-Mich.), was the principal architect of the agreements that 
finally allowed the bill to coast through the floor without serious opposition. 
</P>
<P>
The most difficult of these agreements were negotiated well before the bill 
came to the floor, in closed committee rooms where Waxman and Dingell, longtime 
adversaries in the clean air debate, hammered out compromises on automobile 
tailpipe emissions, smog control and measures to spread the cost of acid rain 
controls. 
</P>
<P>
Clean fuels -- the one major area that remained in dispute and seemed certain 
to provoke a showdown between industry supporters and clean air advocates -- 
was resolved only moments before it came up for a vote. 
</P>
<P>
A proposal by Waxman and Rep. Jerry Lewis (R-Redlands) would have mandated the 
nationwide sale of 1 million cars built to run on non-gasoline fuels. Under the 
compromise, that plan was dropped in favor of a five-year pilot program for 
California, which already has plans to use clean-fueled vehicles as part of its 
clean air efforts. 
</P>
<P>
The new vehicles would be phased into the California market starting with 
150,000 cars in model year 1994. That number would increase to 300,000 cars in 
1997, with the aim of getting 1 million clean-fueled cars onto California 
freeways by the year 1998. 
</P>
<P>
Nationwide, the compromise would require only that fleet vehicles and mass 
transit buses in the country's 31 smoggiest cities be included in the 
clean-fuels program. But other states could opt into the program for private 
vehicles in 1999 if the Environmental Protection Agency judges the California 
pilot project a success. 
</P>
<P>
"This is a historic day for the people of Southern California," Lewis said. 
"Once again California is leading the national clean air debate." 
</P>
<P>
The only California congressman to vote against the legislation was Rep. 
William E. Dannemeyer (R-Fullerton). Not voting was Rep. Bill Thomas 
(R-Bakersfield). 
</P>
<P>
Another House-passed amendment important to California was one that would put 
coastal pollution sources under EPA's jurisdiction and apply stricter onshore 
pollution standards to offshore sources. Offered by Rep. Mel Levine (D-Santa 
Monica), it was adopted after the negotiators defused what would otherwise have 
been considerable opposition by agreeing to exempt Texas, Louisiana and Alabama 
from its jurisdiction. 
</P>
<P>
Dismissing a White House veto threat, the House also included in the bill a 
five-year, $250-million unemployment assistance package to help some of the 
thousands of workers who could lose their jobs as a result of the impact that 
tougher clean air regulations are expected to have on the coal mining, steel 
and chemical industries. 
</P>
<P>
The Bush Administration has threatened to veto the bill over any provision that 
raises the total yearly cost to business, government and individuals above $21 
billion. The Administration says the real cost of the unemployment package 
offered by Rep. Robert E. Wise Jr. (D-W.Va.) could add billions of dollars per 
year to the price of the legislation because it would create an open-ended 
liability for the federal government. 
</P>
<P>
But proponents of the amendment, which was overwhelmingly adopted by a vote of 
274 to 146, dismissed those estimates as exaggerated.
