Thank you for choosing to run Jenifer Warren's article about the Desert Bill 
("Bill to Protect Desert Draws a Noisy 2,000," Nov. 12). She is a good writer 
and leads her readers to think a little ahead and in a responsible way. I've 
been told that the Native Americans, when deciding important issues like this, 
asked themselves, "How will this affect the people seven generations from now?" 
Jenifer's writing helps the general public to start thinking that way.
