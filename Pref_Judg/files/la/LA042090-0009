More showers are on the way for the weekend, packing enough rain to give lawns 
and gardens a decent watering but not much more, the National Weather Service 
said.

Two storms from the Pacific Northwest should drop 0.25 of an inch of rain or 
less in the county, as well as a small amount in the desert, beginning 
Saturday, forecaster Wilbur Shigehara said.

"April showers may bring Borrego flowers," Shigehara said. "It doesn't look 
like it will be much rain. If you have flowers, this rain will be good because 
it's free, and plants love rainwater. It will be good rain to wet your petunias 
and lawns."

A 20% to 30% chance of periodic showers is expected this weekend, along with 
plenty of clouds, he said.

"It won't be raining constantly," he said. "Rain here and there, now and then."

Showers brought about 0.37 of an inch of rain to San Diego this week, and 1.5 
inches to the mountains. Nearly 0.69 of an inch has fallen this month, bringing 
the season total to 6.39 inches. This puts the season ahead of 1989's total 
rainfall to date, but lags far behind the normal average of 8.82.

Temperatures will probably remain constant through the weekend, Shigehara said.

Daytime beach temperatures will range from 62 to 66 today through Sunday. 
Coastal and inland areas will have highs of 65 to 70 degrees, dropping to 52 to 
58 on the coast and 47 to 54 inland.

Highs of 47 to 57 are expected in the mountain areas, with overnight lows of 35 
to 45 degrees. Daytime desert temperatures should be in the 80s, falling to the 
50s at night.
