<P>
More than 100 years ago, the "Francis Xavier of the frigid zone," Father Henri 
Grollier, paddled down the Mackenzie River and beached here, kitted out with a 
long black cassock, a bronze crucifix and the Oblate order's motto of grueling 
devotion, "Usque ad extremum terrae" -- "Even unto the ends of the Earth." 
</P>
<P>
He evidently made a compelling sight: Within days, he had blessed five 
marriages, baptized 34 children and heard 11 adults ask to be received into the 
Roman Catholic Church. 
</P>
<P>
"My trip to Ft. Simpson was a triumphal march," he reported to his faraway 
bishop. 
</P>
<P>
All of that belonged to the glory days of Roman Catholicism in the Canadian 
North, a time when the "Blackrobes," along with the rough-hewn fur traders of 
the Hudson's Bay Co. and a few scattered Mounties, made up what there was of a 
Canadian "government" presence in these parts. 
</P>
<P>
Single-minded young priests traveled by dog sled in winter and canoe in the 
summer, with bundled vestments and skins filled with holy water and wine. They 
slept on spruce boughs in hide tents, hunted, trapped and fished for their food 
and everywhere sought the nomadic native peoples they hoped to convert, who in 
turn sought the migrating caribou. 
</P>
<P>
These days, the Catholic Church in the hard, cold North presents a far less 
invigorating picture. The native peoples of northern Canada -- the Dene Nation, 
the Cree and the Inuit, or Eskimos -- have grown deeply disillusioned about 
white outsiders trying to uplift and "improve" them. Many have turned to their 
traditional legends and beliefs, and in doing so, have rejected the church. 
</P>
<P>
And now, too, there is the sheer scarcity of priests. The earliest Blackrobes 
streamed to the Canadian northwest from France, Belgium and Quebec, bringing 
with them a heartening supposition that as the church took root and flourished 
in the Arctic, a native clergy would rise to carry on. 
</P>
<P>
But not only have Dene and Inuit men proved uninterested in the priesthood; 
these days, even the white Europeans who used to serve in the North are 
unwilling to accept the rigors of celibacy, loneliness, Arctic weather and an 
evermore unreceptive flock. 
</P>
<P>
"I have quite a problem on my hands with recruiting," admits Bishop Denis 
Croteau, sitting in his simply furnished office in Yellowknife, capital of the 
Northwest Territories. Indeed, when Bishop Croteau came here from Quebec as a 
young priest in 1960, there were 62 priests to shrive men's souls in the vast 
775,000-square-mile Mackenzie-Ft. Smith diocese. Now there are only 19. 
</P>
<P>
Most of these are in their 60s and even older. Until recently, a glum reality 
hung over them: When they died, they knew the church in the North was likely to 
die with them. 
</P>
<P>
"But there is a light at the end of the tunnel," the bishop adds. That light is 
being shed by Poland, a country where, in sharp contrast to Canada and the 
United States, Catholic seminaries are full, the church enjoys widespread 
credibility and young men come to holy orders with a zeal to share what they 
have with the rest of the world. 
</P>
<P>
In 1986, a delegation of anxious Oblates from northwestern Canada visited 
Poland, to beg their brethren to send a few good men north of the 60th 
parallel. The appeal worked. By 1995, Poland is expected to have dispatched a 
dozen young priests to take up the work of the aging Blackrobes in the North. 
</P>
<P>
"Poland seems willing to supply us," says Bishop Croteau, whose manpower 
worries were such that he dropped courageous, if futile, hints in the wake of a 
papal visit here that perhaps priests ought to be free to marry. 
</P>
<P>
But in attracting young Polish Oblates to northern Canada, the church is also 
attracting controversy. For northern Canada is marginalized and poor -- a 
little bit of the Third World in North America, people say -- and the 
Blackrobes of yesteryear who grew to understand the region blazed a trail here 
toward the social gospel. 
</P>
<P>
Much in the mold of the liberation theologists of Latin America, priests 
ministering in the Arctic and sub-Arctic have witnessed native misery and 
concluded that if the church were to have meaning in northern lives, it would 
have to get involved in northern, secular struggles. 
</P>
<P>
Thus, it was missionary priests who set up the first cooperatives in northern 
Canada and who organized the first native-language radio broadcasts in the 
Arctic. It was priests who devised new alphabets for the indigenous northern 
languages, and priests who were the first to train scholarly eyes on 
traditional spiritual beliefs and practices. 
</P>
<P>
One aging northern Oblate, Father Camille Piche, achieved local fame for saying 
Mass in Slavey, an Indian language, even though some of his congregants were 
unilingual whites. Lately, he has been fighting a proposed pulp mill that 
threatens to pollute traditional fishing waters of the Mackenzie River basin. 
</P>
<P>
Another noted activist priest, the French-born Father Rene Fumoleau, wrote a 
path-breaking study of northern Indian treaties, and thereby sparked 20 years 
of tough land-tenure negotiations with the federal government. Militant Dene in 
the region regard Father Rene, who lives in a two-room cabin in Yellowknife 
with no running water, as one of but a handful of whites they can trust. 
</P>
<P>
"We western missionaries felt we had more to teach than to learn," Father Rene 
says of his early years in Canada, when he was given five dogs, a sled and 
instructions to ride a 2,000-mile priestly circuit every winter. "It was the 
colonial system. The situation changed, so I changed, too -- no choice." 
</P>
<P>
Can the young priests of Poland build on such a legacy? The Polish clergy, 
after all, has encountered problems of a greatly different nature: not neglect 
by Indian-affairs bureaucrats or mindless resource exploitation by huge outside 
concerns, but half a century of totalitarian opposition. 
</P>
<P>
Their thinking, as an unsurprising consequence, tends to the traditional and 
the conservative -- not to say the reactionary. Liberation theology goes down 
poorly with the Poles; leftist biblical exegesis smacks all too much of the 
Marxist dogma that they and their village pastors struggled so long to 
overthrow. 
</P>
<P>
Thus, when the Canadian delegation set out for Warsaw, skeptics worried. Would 
transplanted Polish priests ever fit in? 
</P>
<P>
One answer may eventually be found in the fortunes of 29-year-old Father 
Andrezej Stendzina, now of Ft. Simpson. Father Andrezej is the first of the new 
Polish priests to arrive in the Mackenzie-Ft. Smith diocese, and today is by 
far the youngest priest serving the faithful for thousands of square miles. 
</P>
<P>
"When I came to Ft. Simpson, I told the people, I have come to learn, not to 
teach," he says in accented English. As yet, no one in Ft. Simpson, aside from 
a few local Canadians of Polish ancestry, has mastered the pronunciation of his 
Polish name. To everyone, he is simply Father Andrew. 
</P>
<P>
Like most of his priest-compatriots, Father Andrew is an unstinting 
traditionalist. He has little truck with a married priesthood and believes that 
politics and religion mix at the peril of the latter. 
</P>
<P>
Liberation theology? He shakes his head. 
</P>
<P>
"When I hear that in some countries (church) people want to bring communism, I 
can't believe it," he says. 
</P>
<P>
At the same time, Father Andrew is the very picture of open-mindedness when it 
comes to the folkways of Ft. Simpson, a traditional Dene meeting place that 
grew apace with the Hudson's Bay trading post here. Already, he shuffles 
rhythmically in traditional Dene drum dances, down by the sacred confluence of 
the Liard and Mackenzie rivers. He has been teaching the young to play soccer. 
He hopes that in a few more months, he'll be fluent enough to say Mass in 
Slavey. 
</P>
<P>
Father Andrew may have his quarrel with a politically engaged priesthood, but 
the faith he has brought to northern Canada was shaped in no small part by a 
worldly wise, and militant, Polish church. 
</P>
<P>
"The government was telling us stupid things, but people could learn the real 
facts at church," he says, negotiating his pickup truck along the long, empty 
gravel roads that link the villages of his vast parish, stopping here and there 
to smoke a cigarette or read his daily office from an Oblate breviary. "The 
church was the moral support for everybody who wanted to change things." 
</P>
<P>
Father Andrew was still a seminarian, preparing for the work of the church in 
Africa, when the Canadian recruiters reached his hometown of Lubliniec, in 
southern Poland, looking for missionaries for the far north of another 
continent. He thought things through and concluded that the need in Canada was 
the more pressing. 
</P>
<P>
"In Africa, they can get young priests any time," he says. 
</P>
<P>
In 1988, he arrived in Toronto, all his earthly possessions in two suitcases. 
He learned English, was ordained in Ft. Simpson, and said his first Mass in 
Edmonton, Alberta, at a nursing home for elderly missionaries. 
</P>
<P>
"You could almost feel their excitement when they saw that finally someone 
young had come to continue their work," he says. "They had sacrificed their 
health, their life, their energy, and they knew that when they had to leave, 
well. . . . " 
</P>
<P>
There are eight villages in Father Andrew's parish, some, but not all, 
connected by gravel roads. The biggest is Ft. Simpson, population 1,000 or so. 
It harbors a rectory roomy enough for the half a dozen priests who used to live 
here; there is also a nuns' residence and a wooden church, painted green and 
white. 
</P>
<P>
Now, though, the nuns are gone, and the priestly population is down to just 
two: Father Andrew and a 49-year-old colleague, Father George LaGrange, who 
until the Pole's arrival was the youngest priest in the diocese. Gone, too, are 
the dog sleds of years gone by. Father George, a pilot, flies a light plane to 
the roadless villages, while Father Andrew serves the rest in his pickup. 
</P>
<P>
Some of Father Andrew's parishioners haven't seen a resident priest in years. 
When he arrives on 40-below winter evenings, he must chip away the ice from the 
doorways, find fuel, scare up a place to sleep, hear confessions and say Mass. 
Some villages have eager beavers who want to help with the liturgy. But others 
have problems that come as quite a shock to him, after Poland. 
</P>
<P>
Father Andrew had never even heard of child molestation before he left his 
homeland; here, he finds it a spreading concern. 
</P>
<P>
He cannot help but notice the drunkards who dodge him in the streets of Ft. 
Simpson. He has received tearful alcoholics who say they want to dry out -- and 
who leave the rectory and head straight for a bar. He has learned, on pastoral 
visits, to step nonchalantly over heaps of garbage on people's living-room 
floors. 
</P>
<P>
"It's terrible sometimes," he says. "It's really hard." 
</P>
<P>
Still, in every household he visits, the people sooner or later ask him to pray 
with them. 
</P>
<P>
There are those who pin a large measure of responsibility for the North's 
rampant social problems on the Catholic Church itself. Angry native Canadians, 
baptized as children, say that in its efforts to "tame" them, the church 
undermined their culture and left them without a sense of who they are. 
</P>
<P>
In particular, these natives blame Canada's so-called residential schools, set 
up by the federal government to assimilate native children, and run by the 
Catholic Church. All across Canada, from 1920 to 1970, native children were 
taken out of their remote hunting villages and compulsorily packed off to the 
residential schools, where nuns cut off their braids, dressed them in uniforms, 
demanded that they speak French and English and made them attend Mass every 
day. 
</P>
<P>
Critics now say that at the very least, the institutionalized children were 
robbed of their ability to live normal lives. 
</P>
<P>
"There are a lot of family problems now (among native Canadians), because 
people don't know how to parent," says Alice Hill, a social worker in 
Yellowknife who grew up in a residential school. She herself is divorced, and 
adds that she cannot talk to her own Slavey-speaking mother any more, because 
the nuns forced her to speak English and forget Slavey. 
</P>
<P>
Worse yet, some native adults now charge that they were beaten, malnourished 
and sexually abused in the schools. At one notorious residential school in 
Saskatchewan, the Thunderchild Boarding School, former students allege that one 
boy died after a severe beating, which police and the church deny. 
</P>
<P>
What no one contests is an investigation that revealed 45 deaths out of 605 
children between 1903 and 1948, when four desperate students torched the 
buildings, forcing the school's closure. The deaths were from a variety of 
causes but the main ones were tuberculosis, diphtheria, whooping cough and 
similar diseases. Critics of the residential schools say the children would not 
have contracted these diseases if they had been left in their villages. 
</P>
<P>
All the same, other native Catholics are still stirred by the religious 
discipline and traditions that a priest like Father Andrew represents. One of 
these is Joe Mercredi, the mixed-blood editor of Ft. Simpson's local newspaper, 
the Mackenzie Times. 
</P>
<P>
Mercredi writes provocative native-rights editorials under the pen name 
"Ramjoe;" last summer, he even took up arms against the Canadian army over a 
land dispute in Quebec. 
</P>
<P>
Yet for all that, he also keeps a picture of Pope John Paul II on his office 
wall, and ridicules fellow natives who trace their woes back to the arrival of 
the Catholic missionaries. He insists that residential schools like 
Thunderchild were the exception, not the norm. He worries that the social 
gospel will divide his people, and he admires tough, traditional priests. He 
was thrilled when he heard that the church was sending someone from Poland. 
</P>
<P>
"I thought, the children are going to have a shield, and that is Father 
Andrew," he says. "He will be like the priests when I was a kid." 
</P>
<P>
On a recent day, Mercredi turned up at the mission house door, asking Father 
Andrew to say Mass, not in English, not in Slavey, but in Latin. 
</P>
<P>
"A lot of the old-timers prefer the Mass in Latin," he explains. "Latin had a 
flair to it. By comparison, English seems dead." 
</P>
<P>
Later that afternoon, a surprised Father Andrew complied. 
</P>
<P>
How to sort out the traditional and the modern, the European and the 
indigenous, the political and the personal? That will be Father Andrew's 
biggest mission in the North. 
</P>
<P>
"I still have a lot to learn," he says. "I'll probably be learning for the rest 
of my life." 
</P>
