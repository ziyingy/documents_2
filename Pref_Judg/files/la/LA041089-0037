Nick Faldo, queen-appointed Member of the British Empire, defeated Some Guy in 
a Red Sweater for the Masters golf championship Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
We cannot tell you much else about the poor slob who lost, except that his name 
is Hoch, which rhymes with choke, which is a word that -- sorry -- cannot be 
avoided when a mortal misses a two-foot putt that could have made him immortal. 
</P>
<P>
The guy who gagged was Scott Mabon Hoch, 33, some American who has not won a 
tournament in five years. About all we could tell you about Hoch before Sunday 
was that he has a degree from Wake Forest, has a brother named Buddy who is a 
pro bowler, and might be needing all his buddies to attend his wake. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm glad I don't carry a gun with me right now," Hoch said, maybe 15 minutes 
after the whole thing blew up in his face. 
</P>
<P>
Morbid? Melodramatic? 
</P>
<P>
No, a little black humor, is all. Hoch actually handled his misfortune rather 
nicely -- better than many would -- when the gods of golf decided to play this 
lousy practical joke on him. They robbed him of a $200,000 first prize, a 
lifetime Masters exemption, an honorary Augusta National club membership, and a 
scroll that would list his name beneath those of Ben Hogan, Sam Snead, Arnold 
Palmer and Jack Nicklaus. 
</P>
<P>
Not only did he lose, he lost pitifully, forlornly, a sad young pup, beaten and 
wet. He missed a putt no more than four feet long -- Hoch called it five, but 
it looked more like three -- at the 17th hole, costing him the championship. 
Then he missed a putt 24 inches long at the 19th hole, costing him the 
championship. Not only did he lose, he lost twice. 
</P>
<P>
You can make a case, of course, that Scott Hoch lost with dignity, honorably, 
because after all, he did shoot a 69 on the final day of the Masters, and did 
outlast the likes of Ben Crenshaw and Greg Norman and Seve Ballesteros, and did 
make shots like his unbelievable uphill chip to the 17th, the one that had us 
primed to immortalize him as The Incredible Hoch. 
</P>
<P>
Yes, to be fair, he was more than just some guy in a red sweater. Throughout 
that hectic back nine, when he was battling tooth and nail against Faldo, 
Crenshaw, Norman, Ballesteros and Some Guy in a Brown Sweater, we admired the 
way Hoch hung tough. 
</P>
<P>
It was easy to see how this relative unknown had actually accumulated nearly 
$800,000 in earnings over the last two years. Rarely a champion, Hoch has a 
habit of being a persistent challenger. On last year's tour, he had 10 top-10 
finishes, and once went 19 consecutive tournaments without missing the cut. The 
guy's no hack. 
</P>
<P>
Yet, in his 10 years since turning pro, Hoch has won only three events, two of 
which were Quad Cities Opens. We are talking about a golfer here who may be a 
household word in Davenport, Iowa, and Rock Island, Ill., but probably not in 
the other half of the quad. 
</P>
<P>
Imagine, he nearly won the Masters. The only reason he even qualified for the 
Masters was that the 14th of their 14 prerequisites for invitation entitles 
anyone who ranked among the previous year's top 30 money-winners to join the 
party, and Hoch squeaked in there 26th. 
</P>
<P>
"I feel good about the way I played," Hoch said. "I hung in there when 
everybody else didn't. I really thought it was mine. All the immortality and 
all that other stuff, I'd be sharing in part of that right now, but I guess 
it's not to be." 
</P>
<P>
In darkness that nearly demanded a Day-Glo golf ball, Hoch and Faldo had their 
sudden-death playoff. Technically, it was their third round of golf in one day. 
They had completed a rain-delayed third round Sunday morning, then played 18 
holes more, then trudged back to the 10th tee. 
</P>
<P>
Faldo, you could say, won the tournament Sunday by shooting a 77, a 65 and an 
8. 
</P>
<P>
The only person who beat Hoch, however, was Hoch. He was the leader after 16 
holes, needing nothing but a couple of pars. And, with "the chip of my life" 
after overshooting the 17th green, Hoch was sizing up that green jacket in 
about a 42 Regular. 
</P>
<P>
But he misread his putt, dropping a stroke. Which was nothing compared to the 
downhill two-footer on the first playoff hole, which is the putt he will be 
seeing in all his bad dreams. 
</P>
<P>
It had to be stroked delicately, because a firm putt that did not drop 
dead-center would go racing past the cup. No way Hoch wanted to four-putt. So, 
he tapped it lightly, and the trickle-down effect was as costly as it gets. The 
putt never had a chance, staying left. 
</P>
<P>
"What can I say?" Hoch said. "I hadn't three-putted a hole all week. Nice time 
to do it. 
</P>
<P>
"I was standing over it thinking, 'This is for the marbles,' and I guess I just 
pulled it. Funny thing was, I wasn't nervous. It was really strange. I really 
felt at ease all day long. I kept thinking, 'This must be my time.' " 
</P>
<P>
Alas, 'twas not. 
</P>
<P>
It was time for the honorable Mr. Faldo, MBE, to make a marvelous putt, a 
heroic one, to win the way a winner should win. And it was time for the guy in 
the red sweater to shrink. Bury him in the Tomb of the Unknown Golfer. He lost 
his chance to be a known. 
</P>
