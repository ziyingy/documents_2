Immigration agents rounded up 54 illegal aliens boarding flights at Los Angeles 
International Airport early today, bringing to 131 the number of arrests made 
in a week-long crackdown on alien smuggling.

The illegal immigrants, from Colombia, El Salvador, Guatemala, Nicaragua and 
Mexico, were arrested while trying to board red-eye flights to the East Coast 
and other parts of the country, said Ernest Gustafson, district director for 
the Immigration and Naturalization Service.

Gustafson said the aliens were dropped off at the airport in clusters by 
smugglers, who were paid $1,000 to $2,000 by their "human cargo." Officials 
seized a car owned by a smuggler, but none were arrested, Gustafson said.
