Laker forward Orlando Woolridge and the rap musician Deezer D will help carry 
the state health department's anti-smoking message to young blacks in an 
advertising campaign beginning this week, Dr. Kenneth W. Kizer, state health 
director, said Monday. 
</P>
<P>
The series of television, radio and billboard advertisements directed at blacks 
is part of the California Department of Health Services's $28.6-million 
anti-smoking media campaign initiated in April to attempt to curb smoking among 
minorities. 
</P>
<P>
The program, funded by Proposition 99 cigarette tax revenues, has attracted 
national attention for its provocative advertising designed to counter 
tobacco-industry ads aimed at vulnerable groups, such as young people and 
minorities. 
</P>
<P>
The new spots, created by the Los Angeles-based advertising firm of Muse 
Cordero Chen, attempt to dispel the image that smoking is glamorous, Kizer said 
at a briefing in Los Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
In one advertisement that will be posted in bus-stop shelters, a picture of 
Woolridge dunking a basketball is accompanied by the message, "If you want to 
smoke on the court . . . don't smoke off the court!" 
</P>
<P>
In a billboard advertisement slated for predominantly black neighborhoods, a 
photograph of a coffin carries the headline: "Cigarette Companies Are Making a 
Killing Off You." 
</P>
<P>
But the campaign's heaviest artillery is a rap music video mocking the tobacco 
industry, starring Deezer D and directed by dancer Debbie Allen. 
</P>
<P>
"The next time you buy a pack, think about my rap. . . . We used to pick it. 
Now they want us to smoke it. Yeah right, you must be jokin', " Deezer D 
exhorts as dancers participate in a mock funeral and choke on cigarette smoke. 
</P>
<P>
With the exception of some public-service announcements, the spots represent 
paid advertisement for television and radio audiences statewide. Officials said 
they hope the rap video receives national exposure on Music Television. The 
hard-hitting messages are necessary because of the tobacco industry's practice 
of targeting minorities in advertising, Kizer said. 
</P>
<P>
"We're fighting fire with fire," Kizer said. "There is no doubt that the 
smoking rate is higher among minorities than it is for whites. This didn't 
happen by accident. It's the result of many years of carefully crafted 
advertising geared toward blacks and other minorities." 
</P>
<P>
According to a 1989 surgeon general's report, minority groups suffer from a 
disproportionate share of smoking-related, ailments such as chronic obstructive 
pulmonary disease, coronary heart disease and cancer. Blacks suffer a 
lung-cancer rate 58% higher than whites, Kizer said. 
</P>
<P>
While smoking rates for blacks have declined at rates similar to whites, black 
male smokers still outnumber white male smokers, 41% to 31%. More than 40% of 
black males over the age of 20 smoke, Kizer said. 
</P>
<P>
However, tobacco industry officials have repeatedly dismissed the charge that 
they are targeting their products to specific groups and, Monday, questioned 
the need for education aimed at a particular group. 
</P>
<P>
"Adults, regardless of race, are capable of making their own decisions," said 
Andrew White, a spokesman for the cigarette maker Philip Morris USA. "I think 
many blacks might take offense at being placed in a protective class simply 
because some people in state government have taken a paternalistic attitude 
toward them." 
</P>
<P>
But Kizer said that the advertising campaign, which is part of a $220-million 
anti-smoking education program funded by Proposition 99, has received favorable 
public response, with letters of approval outnumbering criticism 7 to 1. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
NEXT STEP 
</P>
<P>
The California Department of Health and Human Services today will unveil 
anti-smoking advertisements aimed at Spanish-speaking individuals. Ads 
targeting Asian-Americans will begin airing later this month.
