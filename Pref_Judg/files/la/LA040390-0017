Five workers were overcome by carbon monoxide fumes Monday while working on an 
80-foot-high converter at the Unocal refinery in Wilmington, authorities said. 
None of the workers suffered serious effects.

The workers, all employees of an outside contractor, apparently inhaled the 
fumes from a nearby heater exhaust that was blown in their direction by a gust 
of wind, said Unocal spokesman Jeff Callender.

City Fire Department spokesman Pat Marek said three of the men reported feeling 
faint, but Callender said all were able to climb down under their own power 
from the 80-foot-high ironwork structure, which breaks down oil into high-grade 
gasoline.

Paramedics took the men to Bay Harbor Hospital, where all were undergoing chest 
X-rays and other tests, but none of them was expected to be admitted.
