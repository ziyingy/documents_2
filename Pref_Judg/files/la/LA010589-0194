QDo all cats purr? We have three cats at home, and the one female rarely purrs 
at all, while the other two cats purr loudly with any attention. Could there be 
something wrong with her that might make it difficult for her to purr?

A The mechanism that causes purring in cats is still not well-understood, and 
the reasons for purring seem to be quite varied. Most cats will purr as a sign 
of contentment or pleasure, especially when petted or in anticipation of being 
fed. I have seen cats, however, purr when in pain or fear, apparently in an 
effort to calm themselves.

Cats have individual responses to stimuli, and the fact that one does not purr 
very often does not mean there is a problem. Some cats purr so softly that it 
can be felt rather than heard. Unless your cat shows some signs of a 
respiratory problem or difficulty swallowing, I wouldn't worry. You might 
mention this to your veterinarian on your pet's next visit and have him or her 
check the throat and neck for any possible abnormalities.

QI have a 7-year-old miniature poodle that has had a bad ear infection for the 
past year. Every 3 months, I have to take her to the vet to have her ears 
flushed and to get antibiotics and ointment. The infection always recurs after 
she runs out of medicine. Is it harmful for her to continue using antibiotics 
for a long period of time, and is there anything else that can stop the 
infection? My vet says it is very common in floppy-eared dogs.

A Chronic ear infections are often very difficult to treat and clear up in dogs 
unless aggressive treatment is used. It is true that dogs with thick floppy 
ears often have more ear problems than those with erect ears, although that may 
be because minor problems go unnoticed by the owner until they progress to more 
serious infections.

Treating a chronic ear infection should start with a thorough ear lavage, 
preferably done under sedation or anesthesia, in order to completely clear the 
canal of debris and wax. If your dog has been on the same antibiotics all this 
time, your vet may want to culture the infection before flushing the ear canals 
and try to identify the organisms involved and possibly select a more effective 
antibiotic. A smear of the wax or debris may be necessary to rule out a mite 
infestation. Once the ears are clean and dry, they will be reexamined for 
ulcers and to judge the size of the canal. A topical antibiotic solution should 
be used in the ears.

At home, you will need to clean your pet's ear thoroughly and medicate it 
daily. Weekly examinations may be necessary to follow the course of treatment 
and determine if changes are necessary. Oral antibiotics and anti-inflammatory 
medication may be necessary for up to 6 weeks if the infection is severe 
enough. In some severe cases, surgery may be necessary.
