They smiled a lot and giggled, did the jitterbug and sang in choirs, tended 
garden, had haircuts and read the newspaper. No one would have known they were 
prisoners. 
</P>
<P>
That's the way American government films portrayed the Japanese-Americans 
interned during World War II. 
</P>
<P>
"Basically, the films were staged to show that life in the camps was normal, 
like life outside of the camps," said Bruce Yonemoto, who has collaborated on a 
video installation with his brother Norman that uses uncut, original footage 
from these propaganda films but puts an entirely different spin on what they 
depict. 
</P>
<P>
"Framed: A Video Installation by Bruce and Norman Yonemoto" runs today through 
April 23 at the Long Beach Museum of Art. 
</P>
<P>
The governmental footage, along with internee Toya Miyatake and Ansel Adams' 
photographs of the Relocation Center at Manzanar, Calif., are believed to be 
the only existing photographic record of life in the camps. The interned 
Japanese-Americans were barred from owning or using cameras. 
</P>
<P>
"We're presenting the footage as is, as a record, but also manipulating it and 
trying to reverse the meaning of the material" by superimposing reframed still 
photographs taken from the films over the screen on which the film is 
projected, Yonemoto said. 
</P>
<P>
By reframing a photo of a woman's face, for instance, a seemingly contented 
soul looks like a concentration camp victim, Yonemoto said. Another reframed 
photo crops off the the top of the head and eyes of a little girl standing on a 
stage. Instead of enjoying a moment in the limelight, she seems to be loathing 
an experience she was forced into. 
</P>
<P>
The installation attempts an examination of perception based in part on the 
philosophy of Henri Bergson, Yonemoto said. He read a statement inspired by the 
early 20th-Century thinker's writing: "What we are left with in the film 
documentation of the camps is clearly incomplete. It is broken. As in our own 
incomplete perception of the world around us, the government consciously chose 
only to perceive those parts of the experience that were useful, that satisfied 
a personal, social need." 
</P>
<P>
"Basically, we see things the way we want to," he elaborated, "according to 
what is useful." 
</P>
<P>
The work makes a statement about contemporary propaganda, added the artist, who 
has been collaborating on video projects with his brother since 1976. 
</P>
<P>
Along one wall of the dark, corridor-like installation is a scenic backdrop of 
sky and clouds actually used in television commercials for McDonald's, Hills 
Brothers coffee and other commodities. 
</P>
<P>
"The material about the concentration camps was contrived, it was a commercial. 
Our TV commercials are like propaganda."
