<P>
To the cheers and applause of his colleagues, Assemblyman Gerald N. Felando 
(R-San Pedro) on Thursday won his two-year fight to ban smoking on the floor of 
the Assembly. 
</P>
<P>
On a voice vote, the Assembly overwhelmingly approved the proposal after 
Felando urged lawmakers to take a step to improve their own health. The 
legislator's appeal was tinged with emotion because Felando, 54, last month 
disclosed that he is being treated for a blood-related cancer. 
</P>
<P>
In the last year, he noted in an interview, at least three other members of the 
80-member Assembly have been treated for various kinds of cancer and two others 
have died. Assemblyman Richard E. Longshore (R-Santa Ana), a heavy smoker, died 
last June of pneumonia and Assemblyman Curtis R. Tucker (D-Inglewood) died last 
October from liver cancer. 
</P>
<P>
Those deaths, Felando suggested, have prompted lawmakers to "be more conscious 
about health and about cancer." 
</P>
<P>
During a brief floor debate, Felando admonished his colleagues: "I think for 
the health of the members of this Assembly and for the visitors who visit us 
every day we ought to ban smoking." 
</P>
<P>
Immediately after the ban was approved, freshman Assemblyman Willard H. Murray 
(D-Paramount), who opposed the proposal, crushed out his cigarette, cracking, 
"We're ruled by the tyranny of the majority." 
</P>
<P>
But Assemblyman Richard E. Floyd (D-Carson), one of a handful of smokers in the 
Assembly, kept right on puffing on his cigarette. "If I slip sometimes, I guess 
they can have me arrested," he groused to reporters. 
</P>
<P>
Felando, a dentist, said he quit smoking in 1962. When he began pushing the 
prohibition in 1987, he maintained that the air quality in the Assembly chamber 
was "hazardous to everyone's health." 
</P>
<P>
In September, 1987, Assembly members ducked taking action on Felando's proposed 
smoking curb in the chamber, but had no hesitation about voting to ban smoking 
on public transportation in California. 
</P>
<P>
In the Senate, the right of lawmakers to smoke has not been restricted. Cliff 
Berg, executive officer of the Senate Rules Committee, said the upper chamber's 
members have informally discussed establishing a smoking section, but have not 
considered an outright ban. 
</P>
<P>
Buoyed by his victory, Felando said Thursday he now may seek to prohibit 
smoking in the entire Capitol.
