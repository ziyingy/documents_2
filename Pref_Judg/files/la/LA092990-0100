The House passed a $44-billion, three-year spending authorization bill for NASA 
that includes President Bush's proposal to place a settlement on the moon and 
to begin work on a manned expedition to Mars.

The bill includes no money for the moon and Mars programs in the next fiscal 
year but would spend $444 million on them in fiscal 1992 and $649 million in 
fiscal 1993. The bill, approved on a voice vote after a brief debate, now goes 
to a conference committee to work out differences with the Senate. The House 
passed a similar authorization last year, but the Senate never took action.
