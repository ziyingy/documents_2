Tracy Clarke was always drawn to the sea, and it is there that her ashes will 
be scattered. 
</P>
<P>
Clarke, a 26-year-old lifeguard and avid triathlete from Malibu, was killed 
early last Sunday by a suspected drunk driver as she and four friends started a 
70-mile bicycle ride up the Pacific Coast Highway. 
</P>
<P>
The death of Clarke, a good-natured blonde with an easy smile and a fondness 
for working with children and senior citizens, has stunned her relatives and 
friends. 
</P>
<P>
"If there ever was a symbolic person to rally around, this beautiful, athletic 
woman would be it," said Bob Carmichael, who said he only met Clarke the night 
before her death. He said cyclists have been trying to get bike paths and 
warning signs along the coast highway for years so such tragedies could be 
avoided. 
</P>
<P>
Condolence calls by the dozens began streaming in immediately after Clarke's 
death, said her mother, Pamela Sandmore of Calabasas. "The love that has come 
out of this child's death is absolutely amazing to me," Sandmore said. "This 
kid touched a lot of people." 
</P>
<P>
A memorial service for Clarke will be held Friday at 4 p.m. at the recreation 
center at Paradise Cove in Malibu. The funeral will be private, and her mother 
said her daughter's desire to be cremated will be heeded. 
</P>
<P>
Clarke, who graduated from USC with a degree in gerontology, was a lifeguard at 
Point Mugu and Leo Carillo state beaches, and worked at an Agoura convalescent 
home, Sandmore said. She spent several hours a day biking, running and 
swimming, and was fond of canoeing and other water sports.

According to California Highway Patrol officers and Richard Hudspeth, who was 
bicycling alongside Clarke, the accident occurred about 8 a.m. on the 
northbound shoulder of Pacific Coast Highway just north of Decker Canyon Road. 
</P>
<P>
Although there was a wide expanse of road, the driver of a Datsun B210 suddenly 
drove onto the shoulder and ran over Clarke's bike, throwing her 80 feet into 
the air, said Hudspeth and CHP Officer Vicki Warren. 
</P>
<P>
Clarke's companions "heard the noise, turned around and saw the Datsun leaving 
the scene with the bike still underneath it," Warren said. 
</P>
<P>
Hudspeth said that he and a doctor who happened to be driving by administered 
cardiopulmonary resuscitation to Clarke, but that she had no pulse. Clarke was 
airlifted by Los Angeles County firefighters to Westlake Medical Center in 
Westlake Village, where she was pronounced dead on arrival. 
</P>

Danilo Herrera, 20, of Los Angeles, was arrested farther up the road. He was 
charged Tuesday with four felonies: vehicular manslaughter, felony drunk 
driving, driving under the influence, and leaving the scene of an accident 
where injuries occurred, Warren said. 
</P>
<P>
Herrera "apparently had been drinking," and was on his way to the beach with a 
friend, according to Warren, who said no blood alcohol test results were 
immediately available. Bail for Herrera was set for $100,000, and he remained 
in jail Wednesday pending an Aug. 8 preliminary hearing in Malibu Municipal 
Court, Warren said.

Clarke, a member of the Team Malibu triathlon team, was bicycling Sunday as 
part of her training for a competition in Canada. She was to have left next 
Wednesday. In her place, Team Malibu will be sending three members to compete 
in her memory, including Hudspeth, a longtime friend, Warren said.
