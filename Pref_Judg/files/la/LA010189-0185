During 1988, various Orange County residents wrote about their feelings and 
thoughts in articles submitted to our Sunday commentary columns. As we look 
back, some of those thoughts are recalled:

Jerry Collins on new fatherhood:

Life doesn't begin at 55, but it sure can take a fresh turn. It has for me . I 
have a baby son. It's an odd feeling being a father again. A daughter, 25, a 
son, 18, and a baby. I must take note of the change in the delivery process. 
Back in the '60s, husbands had little to do with it. It was a mother's affair, 
and the doctor's business. The husband's principal task was to stay out of the 
way -- just get mom to the hospital in time. This time I was there. In the 
delivery room, actually being helpful. The years and the participation in the 
delivery have given me new perspective on new little human beings. I look upon 
them for what they are, not what they will be. They are struggling, curious, 
funny and courageous. Little things mean a lot to them. Children are children. 
They are not, nor should they ever be expected to be, small adults. Twenty 
years ago, it couldn't have been this way. Fathers felt foolish pushing their 
babies along in strollers, or sharing a rattle with them in a public park. Not 
today. Fathers may now feel a little clumsy, but not foolish. That's the way it 
is with Jeremy and me.
