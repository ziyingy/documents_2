Jenny Craig and her husband, Sid, are trying to do with diets what Ray Kroc did 
with hamburgers -- make them available to a large number of people at a 
relatively low cost. 
</P>
<P>
And they are also trying to do what he did with the Padres -- own them. 
</P>
<P>
Padre players now joke about Lean Cuisine in the clubhouse, aerobics before 
batting practice and calorie counting after shagging flies. 
</P>
<P>
Jenny Craig Inc. has been one of the fastest growing companies in the nation. 
Revenues have increased by more than 50% in each of the past three years. The 
company had revenues in excess of $150 million for the fiscal year that ended 
June 30, 1989. Assets reached almost $14 million in the 1988 fiscal year, or 
more than triple the previous year's. The company's net worth was listed at 
$3.5 million last year. 
</P>
<P>
Is that enough for them to play in the big leagues? 
</P>
<P>
"I'd think they'd have to have other financial sources," said Cedric Tallis, a 
former general manager of the New York Yankees and the Kansas City Royals and 
now executive director of a Tampa Bay group seeking financing for a baseball 
franchise. "No. 1, they've got to have beaucoup bucks and be baseball 
enthusiasts. It's a tough racket, it takes a lot of money to ante into the 
game." 
</P>
<P>
But company officials are quick to point out that Jenny Craig International 
Weight Loss Centres would not own the major league baseball team. Del Mar 
residents Jenny and Sid Craig would. 
</P>
<P>
Attorney Jerry Kapstein, negotiating the sale for his mother-in-law, Padre 
owner Joan Kroc, is expected to finalize it after the holidays, sources said. 
</P>
<P>
But Kapstein refused to divulge even if the Craigs are involved in 
negotiations, although the Craigs have told friends and associates that they 
will be the new owners. 
</P>
<P>
Jenny and Sid Craig quietly built one of the top diet chains in the burgeoning 
weight-loss industry, which cashes in on the weight-loss hopes of an estimated 
48 million Americans. But today, with their interest in buying the Padres, 
their low profile is rising. 
</P>
<P>
"I never heard of Jenny Craig until all this stuff about the Padres -- it's a 
wonderful public relations opportunity," said one former baseball executive. 
"Ray Kroc used to say whatever he spent on purchasing the team, he got millions 
back in publicity for McDonald's hamburgers. It's crazy what happens in the 
sports pages." 
</P>
<P>
As rumors fly about the Craigs buying the Padres, the two have sought shelter 
at their Aspen, Colo., vacation home. Both Craigs, now on a skiing vacation, 
have declined requests for interviews. 
</P>
<P>
Kroc normally dislikes advance publicity on big business deals. She assumed 
ownership of the team in 1984 after the death of her husband. 
</P>
<P>
Are Jenny, the dame of diets, and Sid, a former dance instructor, the stuff of 
Padre owners? 
</P>
<P>
Today, a smorgasbord of people own major league baseball teams. Marge Schott, 
who owns a car dealership in Cincinnati, also owns the Reds. The president's 
son, George W. Bush, heads a group that owns the Texas Rangers. Gene Autry, who 
played in cowboy movies and sang, owns the Angels. 
</P>
<P>
There's even a precedent for a diet king owning a professional sports franchise 
-- Harold Katz, founder of Nutri/System, purchased the Philadelphia 76ers of 
the NBA in July 1981. For most team owners, though, the common denominator is 
money -- and lots of it. 
</P>
<P>
Some sources say the couple might not have enough money to swing the deal but 
that they have a New York partner, a tidbit -- not yet proven -- that spurs 
wild speculation in baseball circles. 
</P>
<P>
The Padres are selling for about $100 million, said Steven Matt, manager of 
appraisals and valuations at the Arthur Andersen &amp; Co. in Dallas. But the 
expense does not stop there. 
</P>
<P>
As part of the criteria for the team's sale, major league owners request that 
new owners have $200 million in operating revenue. 
</P>
<P>
According to Fortune magazine, Jenny Craig Inc. earned $30 million in pre-tax 
profits during 1988 on revenues of $200 million. During that year, Inc. 
magazine touted Jenny Craig as the sixth-fastest growing private company in the 
country, basing its rating on the young company's 21,000% growth from the 
previous year. As the company's growth began to slow in 1989, the rating 
dropped to 448th. 
</P>
<P>
Earlier this year, the company completed private placement of $100 million in 
secured and unsecured debt securities with a group of lenders: T.A. Associates 
of Boston, New York Life Insurance, Security Pacific National Bank and the Bank 
of New York. 
</P>
<P>
For the Craigs, particularly Sid, the move to baseball is a natural one. Sid 
has always loved baseball and, as a treat, occasionally takes employees to 
games. His colleagues describe him as a fairly laid-back fan. 
</P>
<P>
"He's not a screamer," said Coleman Kane, director of advertising for the San 
Diego-based company. 
</P>
<P>
To beef up his knowledge of the baseball industry and learn about the minor 
leagues and scouting operations, Sid Craig, 57, met recently with a former 
general manager of a major league team. 
</P>
<P>
"The man is a marketing genius -- if it were up to me, I'd give him the team," 
said the former general manager, who asked that his name not be published. 
</P>
<P>
As the sports grapevine buzzes, the questions center on the identity of the 
Craigs' supposed partner and whether the couple is, in fact, the leading 
contender in the field of potential buyers. 
</P>
<P>
The Padres, who sold for $12 million in 1974, are considered to be among the 
top franchises in the major leagues. In 1989, they drew two million fans for 
the second time in history. Although the club does not release a profit-loss 
statement, it made about $4 million profit for the fiscal year ending Oct. 31. 
</P>
<P>
According to sources in the baseball industry, the Padres have made a profit in 
five of the past six years. Their TV and radio revenue also will double 
beginning next season, providing about $18 million from national, local and 
cable broadcasting outlets. 
</P>
<P>
Broadcasting revenue alone would cover the player payroll for the 1990 season. 
They mailed all their player contracts and already have their 10 highest-priced 
players signed in 1990 for a total of $10.3 million. 
</P>
<P>
A sale cannot be officially consummated until the major league owners' 
quarterly meeting March 7 in Dallas. The 12 National League teams must approve 
the sale by three-quarters majority; the 14 American League teams can approve 
it by simple majority. 
</P>
<P>
The league will require the Padres' new owner to have a significant "community 
identification" and name one person as ultimately responsible for all club 
decisions, according to a spokesman from the baseball commissioner's office. 
</P>
<P>
The Padres, meanwhile, remain mum on the sale. They were caught off-guard when 
Kroc announced Oct. 17 that she had put them on the market and in the two 
months since have remained in the dark about negotiations. 
</P>
<P>
"All we know is from what we hear and read in the newspapers," said Jack 
McKeon, manager and vice president for baseball operations. 
</P>
<P>
McKeon and Padre players are anxious to see the deal finalized, so they'll know 
who their boss will be for the 1990 season. 
</P>
<P>
"I just want to see this thing get done," said right fielder Tony Gwynn, who 
has been in the Padre organization since 1981. "Hopefully, the new owners will 
understand that although this is a business operation, you can't run it like 
any other business. You've got to have an open-minded owner who knows that 
things in baseball change constantly, from salaries to players to managers." 
</P>
<P>
The Craigs are accustomed to change. Today, Jenny drives a 1989 Rolls Royce 
sedan, and Sid tools around in a 1987 Porsche, but they both hail from modest 
roots. As Sid grew up in Vancouver, Canada, his mother and father worked in a 
dress shop, according to previously published reports. Jenny's father worked 
three different jobs in her hometown, Berwick, La. 
</P>
<P>
Stationed at Coronado by the Navy, Sid taught dancing in the evenings at an 
Arthur Murray studio. After high school, Jenny worked at a dental clinic, and 
at 22, she married. In her first marriage, she gained 45 pounds during a 
difficult pregnancy. 
</P>
<P>
"I wanted to prove to myself and my family that I could get back into my 
pre-pregnancy shape," said Jenny, 56. "It was easy to motivate myself when none 
of my clothes fit even months after the baby was born." 
</P>
<P>
Jenny joined a health club and worked out with such enthusiasm and dedication 
that the gym owner offered her a job helping others lose weight. Within several 
years, Jenny owned and managed her own facility in New Orleans -- a spot she 
gave up in 1978 to come to Los Angeles-based Body Contour Inc. There, she met 
Sid Craig, then president of the company. One year later, they married. 
</P>
<P>
Their marriage became a business partnership as well. Jenny exudes a charm that 
fosters fierce loyalty among dieters and friends, colleagues say. Many describe 
her as the "people person" who strives to make the diet centers warm, 
supportive environments and writes personal thank-you notes to clients. Sid is 
credited with being the marketing whiz. The two, both workaholics, are athletic 
and enjoy skiing and tennis. They also like watching their race horses run at 
Del Mar. 
</P>
<P>
The Craigs sold Body Contour, and because of a non-competition clause that 
prevented them from setting up shop in the United States, they moved to 
Australia and spent one year and $1 million developing a line of diet foods. On 
May 9, 1983, they launched their effort by opening nine centers in Melbourne. 
But there were problems. The government forced the Craigs to discard 100,000 
boxes of vitamins because they contained a substance that requires a 
prescription in Australia. 
</P>
<P>
The centers were not immediately successful in Australia, a country unfamiliar 
with weight-loss centers before the Craigs' arrival. But after a marketing 
blitz, the company took hold. Today, Jenny Craig has 96 centers in Australia, 
30 in England and 11 in New Zealand. 
</P>
<P>
In 1985, the couple returned to the United States to kick off their business 
and garner a piece of what is currently a $1.5 billion industry annually. 
Though there are currently 269 U.S. Jenny Craig centers, company officials hope 
to expand to 1,000 by the year 1995. 
</P>
<P>
The Craigs found and catered to a changing orientation in dieting. In 1986, 65 
million -- or about one in three -- Americans said they were dieting, according 
to the Calorie Control Council, a group that represents diet food 
manufacturers. Today, that number has dropped to one in four. 
</P>
<P>
"We have a changing perception of what dieting means -- what used to be 
considered a diet is now considered a healthy life style," said Keith Keeney, 
council spokesman. "There is a different dieter out there who is not looking 
for a miracle weight loss. Many want the Jenny Craig approach that helps with 
behavior and offers support." 
</P>
<P>
Under the Craig program, clients pay $185 and receive group and individual 
counseling. Until half the desired weight is lost, clients purchase only Jenny 
Craig meals, pre-packaged and frozen foods. A week of Craig cuisine costs 
between $50 to $75. 
</P>
<P>
And like many diets, some people swear by it, including movie star Elliot Gould 
and LA Law's Susan Rutan, both of whom have done television commercials for 
Jenny Craig. Television's Ed McMahon, who is not a spokesman for the company, 
says he lost 30 pounds on the diet and that the food is delicious. McMahon, a 
6-4 former football player, now weighs 200 pounds. 
</P>
<P>
Even if the Craigs do buy the Padres, Gwynn, the 5-11 right fielder, mentioned 
no plans to start the Craig diet, though he is trying to slim down. But the 
four-time batting champion said he welcomes a new regime. 
</P>
<P>
"As long as they're committed to keeping the club in San Diego and keeping a 
winning team on the field," he said, "that's all we can ask for." 
</P>
