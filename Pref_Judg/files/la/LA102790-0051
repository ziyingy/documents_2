Asbestos, a fire retardant mineral that has been shown to cause lung cancer, is 
being removed from the Pierce College campus. 
</P>
<P>
A 1982 Certified Laboratory Inc. test showed asbestos to be in 76% of the 
Woodland Hills college's buildings. 
</P>
<P>
It is now being removed from the boiler room of the machine-automotive 
building. 
</P>
<P>
Asbestos already has been removed from the agricultural-science building, the 
business education building and the school's cafeteria, said Kelly Simpson, who 
is in charge of the removal for Long &amp; Co. 
</P>
<P>
There will be more asbestos removal projects in the future, Simpson said. "It's 
an ongoing process." 
</P>
<P>
Asbestos removal projects are precarious because during such removal, there is 
a potential danger of releasing the fiber into the air, the very thing such 
projects try to prevent, Simpson said. 
</P>
<P>
Much of the work was done during the summer when the buildings were not in use. 
Also, because of the danger, removal projects are initiated only when leaving 
the mineral in place represents a greater danger than its removal, Simpson 
said. 
</P>
<P>
Upon completion of the removal, many of the buildings will still contain 
asbestos, but only two, the automotive laboratory and the men's gym lobby, will 
still contain "friable" asbestos, Simpson said. 
</P>
<P>
Friable asbestos is asbestos that can easily be crumbled and has a greater 
danger of being released into the air. DAN DOW
