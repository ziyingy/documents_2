"Haole go home." That's Hawaii's version of "Yankee go home." And Haunani-Kay 
Trask, a professor at the University of Hawaii, thinks it's a reasonable idea. 
</P>
<P>
In a recent article in the school newspaper, she urged a student who had 
publicly lamented "Caucasian-bashing" in Hawaii to move back to his home state 
of Louisiana. 
</P>
<P>
"Hawaiians would certainly benefit from one less haole (white) in our land," 
wrote Trask, who is part Hawaiian. 
</P>
<P>
Her remarks touched a raw nerve in a state that prides itself as a Pacific 
"melting pot," where the "aloha spirit" of love and tolerance is supposed to 
prevail. The article set off a raging debate on racism and free speech that has 
engulfed the university and spilled off campus. Passionate letters, denouncing 
or defending Trask, fill the local papers. 
</P>
<P>
The professor contends her remarks are appropriate given the history of 
oppression of native Hawaiians at the hands of Caucasians. Her people, she 
says, lost their health, culture and land through contact with Westerners, and 
they are still struggling to recover. 
</P>
<P>
"Hawaiians have a right to resent haoles (pronounced how-lees)," she said in an 
interview. "We have a historical right. We have a contemporary right." 
</P>
<P>
And whether people agree or not, Trask, and her supporters, defend her right to 
speak her mind. The university, they say, is the best place to air ideas. At a 
rally for Trask this month, supporters carried signs reading, "Free Speech for 
Natives" and "White is Not Right." The professors' union and the Women's 
Studies Department passed resolutions upholding her right to speak out. 
</P>
<P>
But other faculty members and observers accuse Trask of abusing her position 
and creating a "climate of intimidation" on campus. The philosophy department 
has asked that she be reprimanded and its chairman, Larry Laudan, has called 
for her removal as director of the university's Center for Hawaiian Studies. 
</P>
<P>
"We do not believe that the principle of academic freedom gives faculty members 
a hunting license to harass or intimidate individual students for their race, 
sex or beliefs," Laudan said. 
</P>
<P>
The student whose column, "Being Haole in Hawaii," irritated Trask, dropped out 
of school last month. Contacted in Berkeley, while he was checking out schools 
he might attend in California, philosophy major Joey Carter said the 
controversy had become distracting. 
</P>
<P>
"It just wasn't that comfortable on campus. People were constantly coming up to 
me asking questions about it," said Carter, 32. " . . . I didn't get any direct 
threats, but I was getting people saying they knew someone looking for me, 
wanting to bust my face." 
</P>
<P>
His column highlighted a subject seldom aired seriously: racism in Hawaii. No 
ethnic group constitutes a majority in Hawaii, and the state has a reputation 
for harmony among its peoples. The largest ethnic group is white, 34%. 
Hawaiians make up 12% of the islands' population. Other large groups include 
Japanese, 25%; Filipino, 14%, and Chinese, 6%. 
</P>
<P>
Forty percent of marriages each year are interracial, according to state 
statistics. 
</P>
<P>
But there are tensions. 
</P>
<P>
In his article, Carter said he had been chased and beaten by "groups of locals 
who have been taught that I am the cause of their problems, taught to hate or 
fear my skin, hair and eye colors." 
</P>
<P>
Carter, a 10-year Hawaii resident, says he considers people here "a lot more 
accepting than other places," but he wrote the article because discussions of 
racism on campus always focused on "white dominance." 
</P>
<P>
Trask, however, dismisses Carter's comments as "uninformed, childish 
bemoaning." The real racism in Hawaii, she says, is the white domination of a 
native people. She mourns the decimation of the Hawaiian population through 
disease introduced by white settlers and "cultural destruction." In her 
article, she points to the American overthrow of the Hawaiian monarchy in 1893 
and the forcible annexation of the islands in 1898. 
</P>
<P>
"With the overthrow, things Hawaiian were outlawed and things haole American 
were imposed," she wrote. "As an American in Hawaii, Mr. Carter is benefiting 
from stolen goods." 
</P>
<P>
"All I am saying, is 'You're an interloper"' she explained later.'If you don't 
like it, get out.' I don't think it's racist at all." 
</P>
<P>
Trask, 41, calls the reaction to her article a symptom of racism against 
Hawaiians. 
</P>
<P>
"The reason they get so upset is because it's a native woman saying it to the 
dominant white class," said Trask, who wears a kikepa (Hawaiian-style sarong) 
rather than Western dress. "I break the ideology of happy natives and that 
makes me dangerous."
