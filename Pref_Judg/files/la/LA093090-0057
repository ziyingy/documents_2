As Hernan Cortes' small army neared the Aztecan capital of Tenochtitlan in 
1519, they arrived at Iztapalapa, a hilltop village that gave the Spaniards 
their first panoramic view of the sprawling New World metropolis in the valley 
of Mexico. Cortes and his men numbered only 400. The city was the seat of the 
expansive Aztec empire, and had a population of a half million. 
</P>
<P>
As one chronicler in Cortes' band described it, "We saw so many cities and 
villages built in the water and other great towns on dry land . . . we were 
amazed and said that it was like the enchantments they tell of in the legend of 
Amadis, on account of the great towers and cues and buildings rising from the 
water . . . And some of our soldiers asked whether the things that we saw were 
not a dream . . . all was cemented and very splendid with many kinds of stone 
monuments with pictures on them, which gave much to think about." 
</P>
<P>
It is in such moments of confounded awe -- on the eve of great destruction -- 
that Mexican art, as we know it, had its ambiguous birth. For finally, the 
conquest of Mexico was as much a triumph of the eye as it was a victory of the 
sword and gun. 
</P>
<P>
For many years to come, the conquistadores' way of seeing the world would be 
the only true one, and they quickly set about remaking much of the fantastic, 
alien world they encountered in their own image, as a "New Spain." 
</P>
<P>
The chronicler, writing 30 years after the events, concludes his account of the 
dazzling first sight of Tenochtitlan by noting that, "Of all these wonders that 
I then beheld today all is overthrown and lost, nothing left standing." 
</P>
<P>
Now, 471 years later, at New York City's Metropolitan Museum of Art, 
preparations are nearly complete for a new Mexican conquest. Opening Oct. 10 is 
"Mexico: Splendors of Thirty Centuries," the most significant exhibition of art 
from Mexico to appear in New York in 50 years. 
</P>
<P>
From New York City, the nearly 400 objects in the show will later travel 
exclusively to the two Chicano capitals of Mexamerica, appearing first at the 
San Antonio Museum of Art (April 6-Aug. 4, 1991), and then at the Los Angeles 
County Museum of Art (Sept. 29-Dec. 29, 1991). For Los Angeles, it will be the 
most important public presentation of Mexican art since the 1978 "Treasures of 
Mexico" show, sponsored by the Armand Hammer Foundation at the County Museum. 
</P>
<P>
In 1940, the Museum of Modern Art in New York City mounted "Twenty Centuries of 
Mexican Art," the first major exhibition of its kind to be shown in the United 
States (see accompanying story). And in 1970, the Metropolitan Museum hosted 
"Before Cortes," an historic show of the pre-Columbian sculpture of 
Mesoamerica. 
</P>
<P>
But the Met show is perhaps the most comprehensive collection of ancient, 
colonial and modern Mexican artistry ever assembled in the United States. In 
scale, it is the largest show the museum has presented since "The Vatican 
Collection: The Papacy and Art" in 1985. 
</P>
<P>
Currently, designers, lighting engineers, and workmen at the Metropolitan 
Museum are finishing the specially constructed, maze-like exhibition gallery as 
some of the pieces are being installed. 
</P>
<P>
According to the show's four co-curators, all members of the museum staff, 
featured works include Mayan and Aztecan sculptures, early post-conquest 
manuscripts, popular religious and devotional objects, costumes, graphics, and 
paintings, ranging in date of origin from 1000 BC to AD 1950. 
</P>
<P>
Amassing such an enormous grouping of objects is a logistics triumph that has 
been three years in the making, with pieces drawn from 41 public and 24 private 
collections in Mexico, the United States and Europe. 
</P>
<P>
The principal financial supporter of the multi-million dollar event is a newly 
formed, Los Angeles-based foundation, "Friends of the Arts of Mexico," which in 
turn is the brainchild of Emilio Azcarraga, the chairman of Mexico's Televisa 
network. In 1987, Azcarraga approached Philippe de Montebello, director of the 
Metropolitan Museum, with the idea for a comprehensive show of Mexican art. 
</P>
<P>
Although "Mexico: Splendors of Thirty Centuries" is its most high-profile 
undertaking to date, the organization -- which has a mandate to promote 
appreciation of Mexico's artistic and cultural heritage in this country -- has 
already sponsored a touring exhibition of work by young Mexican artists, as 
well as efforts to preserve the Rock Art of Baja California and the David 
Alfaro Siquieros "America Tropical" mural on Olvera Street. 
</P>
<P>
John McDonald, exhibition coordinator of the Metropolitan show, and curator for 
the 19th-Century section, modestly sums up the collection that has been 
gathered for the October opening in New York City as "more than a roundup of 
the usual suspects." 
</P>
<P>
"We wanted to do a comprehensive exhibition. With 50 years since the last major 
show, it was long enough for people to forget, for generations to come and go 
and not have a chance to see this work. It will be an eye-opener for a New York 
audience." 
</P>
<P>
As befits an imperial exhibition of this sort, the scope of cultural periods 
and styles to be represented in the show is impressive, offering the North 
American public a rare opportunity to see under one roof a spectrum of Mexican 
artistic expression that would be difficult to match in weeks of museum touring 
in Mexico City. 
</P>
<P>
Included in the pre-Hispanic section, which will comprise one-third of the 
exhibition, will be one of the colossal stone heads of the Olmec people, who 
came before the more familiar Mayan and Aztecan civilizations. The giant heads, 
discovered in La Venta and San Lorenzo, Tabasco on the Gulf Coast beginning in 
the 1920s, depict faces that appear distinctly Negroid and have caused many to 
speculate on the possibility of ancient contact between the peoples of 
Mesoamerica and Africa. 
</P>
<P>
From the ancient Mayan city of Palenque, there will be an exquisitely 
naturalistic sculptured stucco head with an unforgettable penetrating, yet 
tranquil gaze. Julie Jones, curator for this section of the exhibition, 
explains that recent breakthroughs in cracking the Mayan hieroglyphic language 
allow us to now identify this figure as the king Pacal II, who ruled Palenque 
during during its 7th-Century heyday. 
</P>
<P>
According to Jones, the pre-Columbian portion of the show will not just be "the 
son of 'Before Cortes,' " -- the Metropolitan's 1970 show -- but will reflect 
the expansion of knowledge related to the ancient cultures of Mexico that has 
taken place over the last 50 years, with such "meaningful digging" as the 1978 
excavation of the Templo Mayor in Mexico City. 
</P>
<P>
The cultures of civilizations before the conquest will be further explored 
through artifacts of the great cities of Izapa, Teotihuacan, Monte Alban, 
Palenque, El Tajin, Chichen Itza and Tenochtitlan. 
</P>
<P>
With the mixing of Spanish and indigenous blood after the conquest, Mexican art 
begins to reflect the mastery and subtle transformation of European artistic 
styles, along with an abiding rootedness in the ritual power and visual drama 
of the Pre-Hispanic cultures. A good deal of the rest of the show will 
illustrate this extraordinary tension which is the veritable reactor core of 
the Mexican tradition. 
</P>
<P>
"Rather than finding continuity," observes Johanna Hecht, curator for the 
Colonial -- or Viceregal -- element of the collection, "I would say there is a 
kind of attitude or historical sensibility that carries through. Aztecs 
attempted to identify with the Toltecs. And the criollos and mestizos come to 
do the same with the Aztecs." 
</P>
<P>
Sensitive to advance criticism of her section by some art critics, Hecht 
insists she is not presenting "conquistador art." Indeed, there will be an 
anonymous miniature folk sculpture of St. James the Moor Killer, ironically 
depicted as a conquistador. Also, Jose de Alcibar's somber 1777 religious 
portrait of the newly ordained 22-year-old nun Sor Maria Ignacia de la Sangre, 
which out-Baroques the Spanish master Velazquez with a dizzying excess of 
floral ornamentation and fetishized Christian iconography that comes close to 
being neo-Aztecan kitsch. 
</P>
<P>
A stunning 16th-Century mosaic image of the Virgen de Guadalupe in the show 
stands six feet high and is executed entirely in mother-of-pearl inlay on wood, 
in a frame adorned with cracked shells. This artisanal object exudes a primal 
aura that resonates with the presence of the Madonna's Indian alter-image, 
Tonantzin, the Aztecan goddess who had been worshipped, before the Spanish 
</P>
<P>
came, on the hill where Juan Diego had his visions of the Virgen. 
</P>
<P>
Sadly, because of lending restrictions, this mosaic is among several objects 
that will only appear in the Metropolitan Museum's installation of the show, 
depriving Los Angeles and San Antonio of potentially one of the most popular 
objects in the assembled collection. (This omission may yet lead to the first 
time someone comes to the Metropolitan Museum on a sacred pilgrimage -- a 
number of years ago, a replica from Mexico of the Virgen de San Juan de los 
Lagos attracted thousands of San Antonio worshipers to a barrio chapel to view 
and pray to the small figure.) 
</P>
<P>
With the works to be shown in the 19th- and 20th-Century sections of the 
exhibition, another current of the complex Mexican psyche will be evident. 
</P>
<P>
Rebellion and the struggle for independence are now almost genetically 
ingrained in the Mexican national consciousness. For many artists, this has 
provoked passionate efforts to transcend the Eurocentric vision of the 
conquistador that marked modern Mexico's beginning and achieve a completely 
native aesthetic. 
</P>
<P>
The Metropolitan show promises an array of explosive self-portraits that 
testify to this inner struggle among Mexican artists. From the smoldering stare 
of Hermenegildo Bustos painted in 1891, to the exotic personal mythology of 
Frida Kahlo's "Self Portrait With Monkeys," and the fiery iconoclasm of 
muralist David Alfaro Siquieros' self-portrait, where, with outstretched arm in 
front of him, the artist appears to be tearing at the canvas, attempting to 
escape, or perhaps, to pull the viewer in. All of these paintings, and other 
work by masters such as Jose Maria Velasco, Jose Guadalupe Posada, Diego Rivera 
and the major muralists, and Rufino Tamayo, testify to the crucible of 
self-exploration that has been the forge of revolutionary change in Mexico for 
the last two centuries. 
</P>
<P>
Much of the museum and foundation literature describing the monumental show 
emphasizes the theme of the Mexican tradition's grandeur and continuity, 
offering the images and objects of the massive exhibition as a collective 
symbol of modern Mexico's rich cultural patrimony. 
</P>
<P>
"Mexico has one of the most ancient, continuous, and important artistic 
heritages of any region of the Americas," observes museum director Philippe de 
Montebello in one exhibition press release. "As our neighbor and friend it 
should be better known to us." 
</P>
<P>
The show itself will essentially be organized around the history, and 
prehistory, of the modern Mexican state. With one-third of the exhibits devoted 
to the pre-Columbian civilizations, and another third devoted to the colonial 
period, the remaining work will represent the Independence and Revolutionary 
periods of the 19th and 20th centuries, respectively. The latest work dates 
from 1950. 
</P>
<P>
Altogether, from Mayan stelae to Diego Rivera, the assemblage approximates a 
family history of what Mexican President Carlos Salinas de Gortari -- in 
another piece of exhibition literature -- calls "La identidad nacional" (The 
national identity). The President's office, along with the Ministry of Tourism, 
has gotten into the act with a festival of events, "Mexico: A Work of Art," 
adding yet another level of public relations patina to the Metropolitan show. 
</P>
<P>
Unfortunately, the new exhibition's rather safe conceptual scheme mimics the 
general outline of the 1940 MOMA show, as well as the 1978 exhibition at LACMA. 
Consequently, important recent experiences in Mexico's history, from the demise 
of the idealism of the muralists, to the 1968 student massacre at Tlateloco, 
crippling international debt, and the devastating Mexico City earthquake, will 
go unnoted. And we will have to wait for the next major Mexico show to hope for 
a more thematically reflective and syncretic approach to the profound questions 
Mexico's traditions present. 
</P>
<P>
Referring to the omission of contemporary work, exhibition coordinator McDonald 
explains, "If we had tried to do it justice, we would've had to nibble back on 
other sections -- or break up the show with a staircase to another floor." (The 
exhibit also contains no folk art, which was included in the 1940 MOMA show.) 
</P>
<P>
While this artistic Circus Maximus of things Mexican is likely to win a new 
host of aficionados in New York City, it will be interesting to follow the 
Metropolitan show's impact in San Antonio and Los Angeles, where the rich array 
of objects and images may yet rekindle some of the nationalist artistic 
sentiment that marked so much Chicano art of the Movimiento period through the 
'60s and '70s. At a time when young Mexican Americans are exploring new 
expressions of their own "root aesthetic" in rap, performance art, and film, 
such exposure could add heat and light to their mounting critical mass. 
</P>
<P>
Whatever shortcomings or exaggerations may exist in the show's interstices, the 
exhibits, along with a season of related lectures and films, will compose a 
not-to-be-missed tableau of the ages of a nation. Of course, there would seem 
to be limits to what can be shipped and seen in this country. "You can't 
transport Teotihuacan or Monte Alban or a baroque church," muses McDonald. 
</P>
<P>
Still, in "Mexico: Splendors of Thirty Centuries" we are likely to glimpse the 
deeper streams of Mexican identity, too often overlooked in media coverage of 
the country's Byzantine political system, its poverty- and debt-burdened 
economy, and the perennial concern with the flow of undocumented workers across 
the U.S. border. 
</P>
