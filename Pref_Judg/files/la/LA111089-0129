<P>
Senior leader Deng Xiaoping, taking a historic step toward a generational 
transfer of power, Thursday turned over the leadership of China's armed forces 
to Communist Party chief Jiang Zemin. 
</P>
<P>
But in a related action that virtually guarantees continued tension at the 
highest levels of Chinese politics, one of Jiang's key rivals, President Yang 
Shangkun, was confirmed as No. 2 in the military hierarchy. Yang's younger 
brother, Yang Baibing, also received important promotions in the military and 
party apparatus. 
</P>
<P>
A four-day meeting of the Communist Party Central Committee, which approved the 
military changes, also endorsed a two-year economic program that mixes policies 
demanded by hard-liners and reformers but breaks little new ground. 
</P>
<P>
"It is a confused picture which reflects the confused state of China today," 
commented a Western diplomat with long experience here, who spoke on condition 
that he not be identified by name. "But anyway, Deng is leaving his post, and 
it reflects the end of a 10-year cycle. We are entering a transition phase." 
</P>
<P>
Deng, 85, consolidated power as China's paramount leader in late 1978, two 
years after the death of Chairman Mao Tse-tung, many of whose radical 
egalitarian policies have been reversed by a decade of market-oriented economic 
reforms. 
</P>
<P>
Now, by passing to Jiang the chairmanship of the party's Central Military 
Commission, Deng gives up his role as commander in chief of the armed forces -- 
his last formal post. It is widely believed, however, that his prestige and 
residual authority will enable him to continue to be the ultimate arbiter of 
Chinese politics for as long as he is in reasonably good health. 
</P>
<P>
Deng has emphasized repeatedly in recent months that Jiang, who has a record of 
support for moderate economic reform coupled with a hard-line political stance, 
is his personal choice as China's next paramount leader. Jiang's elevation to 
head the military commission is a key step in boosting his power, but his 
position as Deng's chosen heir remains fragile. This is partly because the 
former Shanghai party boss has few ties within the military, while all the 
other key members of the commission are military men. 
</P>
<P>
Both of Deng's previous handpicked successors -- reformers Hu Yaobang and Zhao 
Ziyang -- fell from power when they proved unable to consolidate a strong power 
base in the military and lost favor with Deng and other elderly leaders for 
failing to crack down on student protests. Hu was replaced by Zhao as party 
chief in January, 1987, and Zhao was replaced by Jiang in June of this year. 
</P>
<P>
President Yang, 82, a retired army general who played a key role last June in 
calling in troops to crush pro-democracy protests in Beijing, is generally 
viewed as less firmly committed to market-oriented economic reforms than is 
Jiang, 63. A power struggle between the two could have profound implications 
for China's future. Many observers, however, believe that neither is likely to 
be able to consolidate power after Deng dies and that some other leader will 
probably emerge. 
</P>
<P>
Before the Central Committee plenum, talk among Chinese with access to 
high-level information was that Deng wanted Yang Shangkun to join him in 
stepping down from the military commission and that Jiang would take over as 
head. But Yang, according to these sources, was seeking the chairmanship for 
himself. Thursday's announcement appeared to reflect a compromise that 
reinforces both Jiang and Yang as key contenders for power, but leaves the 
ultimate succession unresolved. 
</P>
<P>
"For Yang, it's a less comfortable position than to be No. 2 under Deng," the 
Western diplomat commented. But at the same time, he said, Jiang is not likely 
to find it easy "to impose his authority on all these military guys." 
</P>
<P>
The chairmanship of the party's military commission is traditionally the most 
powerful position in China. There is also a state Central Military Commission, 
which usually has nearly the same membership and the same leadership. The two 
commissions are believed to function almost as a single body. 
</P>
<P>
In his letter of resignation from the party commission, which was published 
Thursday by the official New China News Agency, Deng said he will also resign 
from the state military commission. The Central Committee decision promoting 
Jiang and Yang suggest that they will be named eventually to the No. 1 and No. 
2 posts on the state commission, but this action can be taken only by the 
National People's Congress. 
</P>
<P>
On Thursday evening, state-run television showed a cheerful Deng greeting other 
top leaders after the announcement of his retirement. Deng walked easily but 
showed clear signs of his advanced age, including a facial expression and 
occasionally hesitant manner that could mark the beginnings of senility. 
</P>
<P>
During the pro-democracy demonstrations of last spring, which touched off 
China's continuing political crisis, some students accused Deng of being 
"muddle-headed" and called for him to step down. Yang Shangkun, although only 
three years younger than Deng, appears to be in excellent health. 
</P>
<P>
Deng submitted his resignation in a letter to the policy-setting Politburo 
dated Sept. 4. In it, he says he has been "looking forward to completing the 
succession of the older generation by the younger generation as soon as 
possible." 
</P>
<P>
"The fourth plenum of the 13th party Central Committee (in late June) elected a 
leading nucleus headed by Comrade Jiang Zemin and it is now already carrying 
out its work effectively," Deng wrote. 
</P>
<P>
"Our cause of reform and opening to the outside world has just started. We have 
arduous tasks ahead and there will be some twists and turns on our way of 
advance. But I firmly believe that we will be able to overcome various 
difficulties. . . . Since the Chinese people have shown the ability to stand 
up, they will surely have the ability to ever stand firmly among the nations of 
the world." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Continued Austerity 
</P>
<P>
The official communique of the Central Committee plenum, which was attended by 
167 full members and 106 alternate members, declared that a year-old program of 
economic austerity should continue for at least another two years. But the 
meeting also emphasized that China will continue to open up more to the outside 
world. 
</P>
<P>
The plenum endorsed attempts to bring inflation down to less than 10%, to 
balance the national budget, to hold average annual economic growth to no more 
than 6% in the next few years and to direct investment toward agriculture, raw 
materials supply and transportation infrastructure. 
</P>
<P>
"We must at all times . . . place the constant improvement of economic 
efficiency on the top of the economic work," the communique said. 
</P>
<P>
It said: "It is imperative to continue to persist in the policy of opening to 
the outside world, boldly absorb foreign investment and import advanced 
technology while effectively expanding foreign trade and economic and technical 
exchanges. The basic policies and measures adopted for the special economic 
zones and coastal open regions remain unchanged and will be further perfected 
in practice." 
</P>
<P>
But in a warning to reformist, growth-oriented provincial leaders who have 
sought to exempt their regions from centrally imposed austerity measures, the 
communique declared that "it is imperative to firmly foster the idea of taking 
the whole country as a whole, subordinating the interest of a part to that of 
the whole, strengthen organizational discipline and resolutely oppose 
decentralism." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Speculation on Zhao 
</P>
<P>
There had been widespread speculation that the Central Committee would deal 
with the fate of Zhao, the party chief ousted in June for opposing the 
crackdown, who has been presumed to be under some form of house arrest. 
</P>
<P>
Although Zhao was stripped of all his high party positions, including the first 
vice chairmanship of the party's Central Military Commission, the post assumed 
Thursday by Yang Shangkun, he has been allowed to keep his party membership. 
Hard-line leaders including Premier Li Peng have been widely rumored to favor 
putting Zhao on trial. 
</P>
<P>
But the communique made no mention of Zhao. It also made no mention of any 
plans for an intensified purge of Zhao supporters. In the aftermath of the 
crackdown, some close allies of Zhao have been removed from office or 
imprisoned, and several party documents have been published calling for more 
extensive action. But there has not been any sweeping purge of reformists from 
party and government positions. 
</P>
<P>
Still, the plenum appeared to strengthen the influence of the military on 
political affairs. Yang Baibing, 69, a general who had been on the state 
military commission but not the more powerful party military commission, was 
promoted to the party commission. He becomes its secretary general, a post 
previously held by his brother, President Yang. 
</P>
<P>
Yang Baibing was also named to what now becomes the four-member Secretariat of 
the Central Committee, which functions as the executive office of the Communist 
Party. For the past two years, there had been no military representative in the 
Secretariat. 
</P>
<P>
The other key promotion in the military commission went to Liu Huaqing, 73, a 
former commander of the Chinese navy who was named a vice chairman, ranking 
after Yang Shangkun.
