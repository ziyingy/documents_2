The Chicago-area man who pulled his 15-month-old son off a life support system 
at gunpoint and kept police at bay while the child died in his arms April 26 
returned to the hospital for the second time in less than a week. Two days 
after he was taken to Mac Neal Hospital suffering from a violent reaction to 
the illegal drug PCP, Rudolfo Linares, 23, was admitted to the same hospital 
after an overnight arrest for alleged drunk driving. A hospital spokeswoman 
declined to disclose Linares' condition or the reason for his hospitalization. 
Last month, a Cook County grand jury refused to indict Linares on murder 
charges in connection with his brain-damaged baby's death.
