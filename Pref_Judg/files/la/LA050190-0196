Progressive Nursing Services in Los Angeles has grown from a staff of four 
nurses in 1985 to 200 today, and expects to hire 100 more this year alone. 
</P>
<P>
At the other end of the scale, California's fifth-largest employer, National 
Medical Enterprises, has added 3,700 employees in the past two years and plans 
to hire "across the board" this year -- if it can find the workers, that is. 
</P>
<P>
If you're a nurse, pharmacist, medical technician or other health professional, 
chances are you will be able to write your own prescription for a job. Health 
services is one of California's leading areas of job growth, The Times survey 
-- and other forecasts -- of hiring trends indicate. 
</P>
<P>
The demand for health care has mushroomed because of an aging population, new 
services and advanced technology that is extending the lives of critically ill 
people who might not have survived in an earlier age, analysts say. 
</P>
<P>
"We're all scrambling for resources," said Norma Resneder, National's director 
of human resources. "It's as competitive as I've seen it in a long time." 
</P>
<P>
About 57% of 14 publicly traded health-service firms surveyed by MZ Group of 
San Francisco for The Times reported plans to increase hiring this year. That 
was the highest percentage in three years -- contrasted with 23% in 1987 and 
30.8% in 1988. 
</P>
<P>
Companies involved in services, financial services, retail and computer 
products are also expected to produce a job bonanza, experts say. 
</P>
<P>
In the service sector, 63.9% of 36 firms surveyed planned to add staff, a boost 
from 48.4% the previous year. The survey also showed expansion plans among 
56.7% of 30 financial services firms and 54.5% of 22 retailers. Aging baby 
boomers, who are saving more and thus needing investment vehicles, has helped 
spur the growth in financial services jobs, experts say. 
</P>
<P>
In high-tech, the hiring outlook has dimmed. The proportion of computer 
products firms planning to add staff has dropped to 50.7% from 72.1% the 
previous year and, among electronics companies, to 48.6% from 62.3%. 
</P>
<P>
Firms involved in energy, basic materials, real estate, telecommunications and 
utilities reported no new plans to significantly increase their hiring this 
year. 
</P>
<P>
The general increase in service jobs reflects the maturing of the economy that 
has occurred during the past 30 years, said David Hensley, director of 
California forecasting for the Business Forecasting Project at UCLA. Because 
businesses are continuously making productivity gains in manufacturing, 
reducing the need for workers, the labor needs are shifting toward service, he 
said.

Job growth in Southern California is expected to grow twice as fast as the 
national rate, with expansions in high-technology, entertainment and 
international trade more than offsetting cuts in the aerospace industry, said 
Steve Levy, director of the California Center for Continuing Study of the 
California Economy in Palo Alto. 
</P>
<P>
"In 1989 and 1990, we've gone through a portion of the Defense cutbacks, and 
those people, in a macro-sense, have been absorbed very well," Levy said. "The 
reason we're able to start so many new small- and medium-sized firms is because 
of the market, the technology and our proximity to foreign trade." 
</P>
<P>
In particular, Levy said, California's link to the Pacific Rim, which he called 
the world's fastest-growing trade and investment corridor, would produce jobs 
ranging from ports and airports to banks and investment firms. 
</P>

For instance, California aerospace jobs shrunk by 16,239, from 161,734 in 1988 
to 145,495 in 1989. All five of the state's top aerospace employers in The 
Times survey cut their work forces last year, including a loss of 6,460 
California jobs at Lockheed Corp. and 2,360 at Rockwell International. 
</P>
<P>
But employment in financial services grew by 4.6% last year, producing 6,214 
new jobs in California, while the services sector grew by 10.8%, with 12,445 
new California jobs. 
</P>
<P>
For the second year in a row, publicly traded computer companies led all 
industrial sectors in job growth. Those firms produced 29,000 new jobs 
worldwide, to 278,177 in 1989 from 249,115 in 1988, an increase of 11.7%. But 
that was lower than the previous year's rate of 18.9%. 
</P>
<P>
And much of the growth is replacing jobs lost during the industry's severe 
recession in the mid-1980s, Hensley said. The net number of computer industry 
jobs in California grew by only 2.9% from 1985 to 1989, while the number of 
electronics components jobs actually declined by 2,000, or 1.3%, during that 
same period, he said. 
</P>
<P>
"High-tech is not producing many new jobs at all," Hensley said. "I think that 
sector is better characterized by rapid growth in output and productivity 
gains, so they don't need to hire people." 
</P>

Quantum Corp., a disk-drive maker in the Bay Area, confirms -- and contradicts 
-- that observation. It began manufacturing advanced disk drives in its 
Milpitas plant in March -- but hired no new assemblers, choosing instead to 
automate with 11 robots. However, the firm's overall staff grew by nearly 40% 
last year with the addition of highly skilled workers: 75 engineers, 30 
marketing representatives, 25 finance and administration personnel, and 70 
skilled manufacturing workers, said Joe Rodgers, Quantum's executive vice 
president of finance.

California's largest computer-related employers are slowing their hiring, 
according to The Times survey. 
</P>
<P>
Apple Computer Co. reduced its staff by 1,200 last year, after a cut of 228 
jobs in 1988. Although Hewlett-Packard Co. added 1,000 workers last year, 
spokeswoman Joan Tharp said the firm "severely restricted" its hiring in 
mid-1989 and expects those hiring controls to remain in place this year. 
Advanced Micro Devices replaced none of the 1,000 jobs it cut in 1988.

The state Employment Development Department projects that service jobs -- 
especially in health, law and software -- should grow the most rapidly between 
1985 and 1995. In total jobs, nurses will lead the demand with 67,110 new 
positions, followed by accountants and auditors at 47,940. 
</P>
<P>
The top five occupations expected to show the fastest rate of growth are 
paralegals, computer programmers, data processing equipment repairers, lawyers 
and computer programmer aides, according to an EDD study. 
</P>
<P>
The Times survey reported a 5.2% reduction in jobs among 25 publicly traded 
health services firms last year, mainly because of cuts at a few of 
California's largest companies. 
</P>
<P>
Many of those jobs weren't actually lost, however. Rather, they were shifted to 
other health-care providers who might not have met The Times' 100 survey 
criteria of being publicly traded firms with headquarters in California. 
</P>
<P>
For instance, Beverly Enterprises, the nation's largest nursing home operator 
based in Pasadena, showed a decline of 12,334 jobs between 1988 and 1989. 
Spokesman Bill Ihle said, however, that Beverly didn't lay off workers. It sold 
several facilities to firms outside the state. Thus, the jobs still exist but 
aren't recorded in the survey. 
</P>
<P>
Another study by the UCLA Business Forecasting Project showed that the total 
number of health-service jobs in California increased by 3.5% in 1989.
