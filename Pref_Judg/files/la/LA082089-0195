United Humanitarians of Orange County is extremely concerned about a recent 
development in our county regarding lost pets. The cities of Westminster and 
Costa Mesa are no longer contracting with the county's animal shelter in 
Orange, effective July 1, 1989. Because cats and dogs often cross the borders 
between cities, this also affects the many cities bordering on Westminster and 
Costa Mesa. This change means that owners of lost pets now need to look at two 
or three different facilities. 
</P>
<P>
If you live in or near Westminster and are missing or have found a pet, please 
call Westminster Animal Control at (714) 898-3311, between 8 a.m. and 4:30 
p.m., seven days a week. 
</P>

You should also look for your pet at the Orange County Humane Society, 21632 
Newland St., Huntington Beach, or call (714) 536-8480. This is a private 
veterinarian's facility that Westminster now contracts with for animal shelter 
services. I also suggest that you call Seal Beach Animal Control at (213) 
431-2541.

If you live in or near Costa Mesa and are missing or have found a pet, you 
should call Costa Mesa Animal Control at (714) 754-5311. Costa Mesa pets are 
taken to the Bayshore Animal Hospital, 2077 Harbor Blvd., Costa Mesa. The phone 
number is (714) 646-3800. Westminster and Costa Mesa residents, and those of 
their bordering cities, should be sure to look at the above facilities in 
addition to the county animal shelter at 561 The City Drive, Orange.

Unfortunately, this change will undoubtedly cause the killing of many pets 
while owners are looking at one facility and their pets are being housed or 
killed in another. An owner's identification tag should always be on your dog 
or cat. For one month, UHOC is offering readers a superior Formica ID tag at 
our cost. Send a self-addressed, stamped envelope to UHOC, 8921 Blackheath 
Circle, Westminster, Calif. 92683, and we will mail you an order blank 
immediately.
