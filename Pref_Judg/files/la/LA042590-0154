The Food and Drug Administration will consider applications for AIDS home test 
kits that would enable people to send a small blood sample to a laboratory and 
get the results by telephone, a spokesman said today.

The agency has accepted one application and has sent letters to 30 other 
companies that are developing test kits or have expressed interest in doing so, 
said FDA spokesman Brad Stone.

<P>
Until now, the FDA has refused to accept home test kit applications because of 
technical concerns, such as how well people could be instructed with written 
material to draw their own blood and whether samples could be shipped safely 
through the mail.

The agency also worried about how people using the tests would be counseled 
about the disease.
