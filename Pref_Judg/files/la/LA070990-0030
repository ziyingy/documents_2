Along the Ventura Freeway near the Ventura and Santa Barbara county line lies a 
small tropical paradise that for years has astonished weather analysts and 
farmers. 
</P>
<P>
Tucked between the ocean and 300-foot-high bluffs is a place called La 
Conchita, the small seaside community that is also the home of the only 
commercial banana plantation in the continental United States. 
</P>
<P>
There 10,000 banana trees are fanned by balmy ocean breezes, basking in an 
island of frost-free weather. When Ventura freezes over, the Seaside Banana 
Garden is frost-free. When Santa Barbara shivers, bananas at the 12-acre 
plantation ripen on the stalk. 
</P>
<P>
One of the managers of the tiny banana republic is Doug Richardson, 41, an 
occasional landscaper who began cultivating bananas six years ago as an 
experiment in his front yard. He found the banana plants he was growing for 
ground cover were actually producing tasty fruit. In 1985, he decided to grow 
them commercially. 
</P>
<P>
Richardson said that up until then, growing bananas "was unheard of in this 
state." 
</P>
<P>
A geography major at UC Santa Barbara, Richardson had researched temperatures 
in other countries where bananas are traditionally grown. 
</P>
<P>
"What I discovered is that we have a unique climate here," Richardson said. 
</P>
<P>
During the next few months of summer, the plantation will enjoy hothouse 
temperatures hovering between 85 degrees and 95 degrees. In winter, when frost 
damages crops 10 miles away in Ventura or Carpinteria, banana trees stay cozy 
in temperatures that are 8 to 15 degrees higher, Richardson said. 
</P>
<P>
Richardson's partner, Paul Turner, 43, said he was skeptical at first. But 
old-timers told him they had never seen a frost in La Conchita. Then he learned 
that the plantation has higher temperatures than the Canary Islands off the 
coast of Africa. "I figured that if they can do it there, we could do it too," 
Turner said. 
</P>
<P>
The farm produces 10 to 20 tons of bananas per acre every year, compared to 25 
to 30 tons on other banana plantations. Two years ago, the two were quoted as 
saying that they hoped to gross about $200,000. But today both Richardson and 
Turner are more circumspect about what they garner from nearly a quarter of a 
million pounds of bananas sold every year. 
</P>
<P>
Although they declined to reveal revenues, both said they are barely breaking 
even after five years of farming. Last year, they planted seven more acres, an 
expansion that is not expected to begin producing until next year. 
</P>
<P>
Agricultural officials and other farmers acknowledged that the plantation is an 
environmental oddity. 
</P>
<P>
"I tried to grow bananas on the Oxnard Plain and they froze," said Rob Brokaw, 
a grower who also specializes in rare and exotic fruits. Richardson "is growing 
a crop that is not supposed to exist out of the tropics." 
</P>
<P>
The main reason the plantation does so well in the winter is that the ocean -- 
with its temperate currents only a few hundred yards away -- maintains a 
moderate temperature, said Bob Brendler, an adviser with University of 
California Cooperative Extension. 
</P>
<P>
The moderate air coming off the ocean moves up the area's steep slopes, 
breaking up any stagnant, freezing-cold air. In summer, ocean breezes bathe the 
area with cool, humid air, mimicking the climate of the tropics. 
</P>
<P>
But the plantation is not unique, as its operators believe, Brendler said. 
Dozens of other islands of peculiarly warm weather, known as microclimates, can 
be found around the county, he said. Farmers interested in growing tropical 
fruits are discovering they too can cultivate exotic crops. 
</P>
<P>
Richardson and Turner themselves admit that their La Conchita plantation is not 
the only hot spot in the county. They found another in Carpinteria where they 
grow bananas, but the crop yield is much smaller. 
</P>
<P>
Word of Ventura County's banana plantation has reached the Washington-based 
International Banana Assn., which promotes bananas for a dozen member companies 
around the globe. 
</P>
<P>
Robert Moore, the top banana of the association, called the farm a "climatic 
nonconformity." 
</P>
<P>
Banana plantations are usually located in subtropical climates where the 
temperatures rarely dip below 55 degrees, Moore said. Banana farming was 
previously thought impossible in California, and certainly in areas far away 
from the porous volcanic soil that plants favor, he said. But Seaside Banana 
Garden has changed his mind. 
</P>
<P>
"It's a very unusual spot," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Some of the banana farm's success goes beyond climatological luck. Seaside 
Banana Garden requires intensive agricultural methods. For instance, instead of 
relying on tropical rainfall, the two farmers have planted drought-resistant 
varieties of banana tubers and lined the groves with black irrigation pipes. 
</P>
<P>
Every stalk of bananas is covered with a bright blue plastic bag to speed the 
ripening process and prevent damage from the leaves. Each banana tree is 
hand-cultivated by a crew of six workers. New small trees are placed in pots. 
</P>
<P>
Soon the plantation will take on a new venture, producing an experimental patch 
of pineapples, now growing in small pots under the hot sun. 
</P>
<P>
Known in the small one-supermarket community of La Conchita as the "banana 
guys," Turner and Richardson take more than a passing interest in talking to 
the dozens of tourists who stop by to buy bananas at a small thatched hut 
Richardson built near the Ventura Freeway between March and November. Tourists 
like to hear about the wide variety of bananas grown at the farm, they said. 
</P>
<P>
But at $1 to $4 a pound, the bananas are not cheap. They are available only in 
exclusive organic food stores and pricey restaurants across the country. But 
that has not prevented Midwestern yuppies, New York delicatessens and fancy Los 
Angeles eateries from ordering them through overnight mail. 
</P>
<P>
Although they still have not tallied the number of mail order buyers, the two 
men said that most of them are not looking for exotic varieties and can afford 
to pay for it. 
</P>
<P>
Ivan Volent, for one, said he has developed a taste for exotic breeds of 
bananas and has a standing order of one 40-pound box of bananas delivered to 
his Santa Fe, N.M. home every month. Each box costs him $35. 
</P>
<P>
Richardson and Turner say one of their plans is to turn the plantation into a 
roadside attraction where a guide would lead groups on a 20-minute tour through 
the groves, explaining the origin of banana plants. 
</P>
<P>
Yet, neither Richardson nor Turner want to go so far as turning their 
plantation into a tropical Knott's Berry Farm. "It could become an A-1 tourist 
trap," Turner said. 
</P>
<P>
"We're occupied in our farm," Richardson said. "We're just down-and-dirty 
farmers." 
</P>
