After five years of slogging it out in the basement of a church, Beth Burns and 
the St. Joseph Ballet school and company moved into a new, grander location in 
Santa Ana's Fiesta Marketplace on Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
The move came courtesy of five partners in the downtown Marketplace, who are 
providing the 4,000-square-foot facility rent-free for five years. 
</P>
<P>
Additional help came from a $60,000 grant from the city of Santa Ana and 
donations from private individuals that paid for the architectural design, an 
oak floor, floor-to-ceiling mirrors and dressing rooms. 
</P>
<P>
A gift of $55,000 to complete the facility was donated by the New York-based 
Daniel and Florence Guggenheim Foundation. The studio has been named the 
Guggenheim Dance Studio in honor of the grant. 
</P>
<P>
Artistic director Beth Burns founded the troupe in 1984 to offer ballet 
training and dance opportunities to disadvantaged, inner-city youths ages 9 to 
19. She estimates that she has trained more than 800 young people in ballet and 
dance and reached an additional 7,000 through dance programs given in local 
schools. 
</P>
<P>
The company was founded under the auspices of the Sisters of St. Joseph of 
Orange, which Burns joined in 1978. She left the order this summer, she said, 
to "continue (my) spiritual development in other paths." The company, which she 
will continue to head, was incorporated as a separate entity in January.

<P>
For five years, classes and dance events had been held in the basement of the 
Episcopal Church of the Messiah in Santa Ana. 
</P>
<P>
"Unless they had given us that space free . . . we wouldn't be anything," Burns 
said. "(But) it was small, less than 1,000 square feet, and our classes 
sometime have more than 40 children. . . . We were really overcrowded. This is 
an enormous improvement." 
</P>
<P>
Burns said she plans to increase enrollment and number of classes by 50%. 
</P>
<P>
The budget picture also looks good, with the company only $35,000 short of 
meeting a 2-for-1 challenge grant of $150,000 pledged by two Orange County 
couples. The deadline for meeting that grant is Dec. 1. 
</P>
<P>
"When people see the children perform," Burns said, "it's a real testimony to 
the transformative powers of any classical means of expression. 
</P>
<P>
"It's very exciting and rewarding to see how dance is changing these children's 
lives. . . . We need these children. I don't think doing this is just one way, 
but a two-way street. Volunteers and donors are renewed by what is happening to 
these children's lives."
