Buzz Hardy, the owner of Sundown Marine in San Diego, stands to lose more than 
$600 on each of the five sleek 17-foot Glastron Futura powerboats now on sale 
at his dealership for $13,600, a 20% markdown from his asking price six months 
ago. 
</P>
<P>
Such close-out prices are a first in Hardy's 13-year career as a boat merchant. 
But, with Sundown's 1989 boat sales down 25% from the previous year, and with 
1990 off to a less than auspicious start, Hardy just can't afford to watch his 
showroom become a perpetual dry dock. 
</P>
<P>
"Nobody was buying. Nobody was even looking," Hardy said. "It's not that people 
were out there wanting to buy but couldn't get credit. They just flat weren't 
coming into the store." 
</P>
<P>
The price cuts by Hardy and several other Southern California boat dealers were 
a symptom of a significant slump in recreational power boat sales nationwide 
last year, the first decline in boat sales after seven years of growth. 
</P>
<P>
According to figures compiled by the National Marine Manufacturers Assn., boat 
sales dropped last year to 638,000, a 15% decline from the 749,000 units sold 
in 1988. The sales figures include sailboats and power boats. Total dollars 
spent on all boats and boating accessories fell to $17.1 billion in 1989, from 
$17.9 billion in 1988. 
</P>
<P>
Industry analysts have blamed everything from bad weather and rising interest 
rates to the San Francisco earthquake, which hit just a few days before one of 
Southern California's biggest boat shows, for the seven-month slump. But the 
one thing on which everyone agrees is that dealers were stocked with more boats 
than they could sell at a time when consumers were looking elsewhere for 
recreation and entertainment. 
</P>
<P>
"The market was contracting, and we continued to build into that down cycle," 
said Greg Proteau, spokesman for the National Marine Manufacturers Assn. in 
Chicago. "It's very hard to just turn off the switch, and it's going to be a 
little difficult to turn it back on." 
</P>
<P>
The power boat industry has gone through tremendous change since the end of 
1986, when most boats were assembled by dealers who had to buy the boat shell, 
engine and trailer from separate specialty manufacturers. 
</P>
<P>
At about that time, Brunswick and Outboard Marine, two of the nation's largest 
producers of powerboat engines, began to realize that there were profits to be 
made by integrating the industry, and embarked on plans to bring the disparate 
aspects of boat making under one roof. 
</P>
<P>
In December, 1986, Brunswick took the first step by spending $425 million to 
acquire Bayliner Marine, which is generally regarded as the first boat company 
to package boats, engines and trailers at reduced prices. Outboard Marine soon 
followed suit, and, by February, 1989, had spent $230 million to buy 10 smaller 
boat manufacturing companies, including Chris Craft and Four Winns, two widely 
recognized brand names. 
</P>
<P>
The acquisitions appeared to be to everyone's benefit, said Outboard Vice 
President Wayne Jones. "Dealers like the idea of not having to be the final 
assembler. Boat manufacturers can do their job more cheaply by pre-rigging all 
the controls in a boat. And consumers like the one-stop shopping." 
</P>
<P>
But many dealers now say they were taken in by the acquisition frenzy, 
encouraged to take on more boats than they could sell by smaller manufacturers 
who were eager to look attractive to the big buyers. 
</P>
<P>
"During that period of acquisition, a lot of boat manufacturers exaggerated 
their production and filled the dealer pipelines with excessive inventory," 
said Tom Fetter, owner of Kettenburg Marine in San Diego, a large distributor 
of marine parts. 
</P>
<P>
But rising interest rates and declining consumer confidence soon led to a slip 
in sales by early spring, marking the start of what many analysts describe as a 
leveling off period for the boating industry. 
</P>
<P>
Last week, Outboard Marine projected net losses in the $15-million to 
$19-million range for the first quarter ended Dec. 31, with total sales down 
about 12% from last year. Although a $100-million pretax restructuring charge 
last year makes it difficult to compare Brunswick's earnings in 1989 with the 
year before, securities analysts put the marine segment's losses, excluding 
extraordinary charges, at about $10 million for each of the last two quarters. 
</P>
<P>
Stock prices of both publicly held companies have recently traded at or near 
their 52-week lows. 
</P>
<P>
In an effort to streamline its costs and to combat massive declines in 
powerboat sales, Brunswick last summer reorganized its marine group, closed six 
plants and laid off more than 4,000 workers. But some predict the decline will 
continue at least through the end of the year, if not longer. 
</P>
<P>
"The boat business is in trouble and it has been for some time," said Merrill 
Lynch securities analyst Harold Vogel. "The consumer is tapped out. They're 
borrowed up to their necks. Their houses aren't increasing in value. I 
personally think it's a recession, and that it's not going to turn around any 
time soon." 
</P>
<P>
Despite that bleak prognosis, many local dealers remain optimistic they will be 
able to ride out the storm. 
</P>
<P>
Several dealers interviewed said they are coping with the sales slump by 
stepping up advertising, cutting prices and passing on manufacturer-sponsored 
financing programs. 
</P>
<P>
Hardy of Sundown Marine said that some customers have been buying boats from 
him through an aggressive loan-financing program made available through 
Outboard Marine that required no down payment. 
</P>
<P>
Gene Ciccarelli, a principal of Newport Pacific boat dealership in Newport 
Beach, said he cut about 3% from his boat prices about six months ago in order 
to make the boats more attractive and to eliminate a "negotiating buffer" that 
allowed "a silver-tongued attorney to get a better deal than a blue collar 
worker who doesn't have the same verbal skills." 
</P>
<P>
He also put younger people who are willing to work for less money onto his 
sales force and and trained them to drum up prospective customers with 
telephone and direct mail solicitations. 
</P>
<P>
Other dealers are consolidating their operations or offering a wider array of 
recreational products to their customers. Sea Ray power boats in San Diego 
recently joined forces with Winnebago dealer Herb Hulet in an effort to "hedge 
our bet into the '90s," Hulet said. 
</P>
<P>
Although the sales slump has changed the way a lot of powerboat dealers do 
business, it appears to have had less effect on dealers who sell big, expensive 
yachts. 
</P>
<P>
Bud Sperling, co-owner of Pacific Yacht Sales in Marina del Rey, said that, 
although he saw fewer first-time buyers last year, he more than made up the 
difference in sales of larger boats, many priced at more than $200,000. 
</P>
<P>
"We've tended to sell more and more boats in the 38-foot to 58-foot category," 
Sperling said. "We've also tended to see people graduating into larger and 
larger boats." 
</P>
<P>
Indeed, the operative phrase for the 1990s, according to the National Assn. of 
Marine Products and Services, is "Fewer but larger," with weaker companies 
closing shop and profitable ones consolidating and winning larger shares of the 
boating market. 
</P>
<P>
By 1994, according to a study published by the association, the number of 
healthy dealerships nationwide is expected to drop to 8,000 from a high in 1988 
of 10,000. 
</P>
<P>
On average, the surviving dealers are expected to generate an average of $2.4 
million each in sales, up from an average of $1.3 million in 1988.
