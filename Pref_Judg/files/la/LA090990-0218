City officials said they will ask an archeologist to examine the site of a 
proposed $20-million shopping center to see whether it contains an Indian 
burial ground. 
</P>
<P>
An archeological find in the vicinity of the abandoned Southern Pacific train 
depot could stall and even endanger a commercial project that the city has 
planned for 12 years and floated $7 million in bonds to help finance. 
</P>
<P>
Lobbying by two Indians prompted the city's move. The 16-acre triangular site, 
about a mile east of the San Gabriel River Freeway, is the likely location of 
an Indian burial ground and should rest undisturbed, said Jimi Castillo and 
Lupe Lopez, cousins-in-law who trace their ancestry to Southern California 
tribes. 
</P>
<P>
After initial surprise and skepticism, the city is taking the issue seriously 
and has invited an Irvine environmental firm, LSA Associates, to bid on an 
archeological study of the area. 
</P>
<P>
The specter of further delays comes just as the shopping center cleared two 
major hurdles. At its Tuesday meeting, the city's Redevelopment Agency approved 
the building and landscaping design. 
</P>
<P>
Next, agency members unanimously approved a proposal that will settle, for the 
time being, the issue of what to do with the 100-year-old depot on the site. 
The station, a national historic landmark, will be moved to a Penn Street lot 
owned by the Union Pacific Railroad. Leasing the land will cost the city $700 a 
year; moving the depot will cost $34,730. Many preservationists who lobbied to 
save the depot have said they accept the plan. 
</P>
<P>
Hank Cunningham, the city's assistant city manager for community development, 
said he hopes the city can also resolve the burial ground issue. 
</P>
<P>
"There is no indication of any historic or archeological artifacts on the 
site," he said. "And we base that on two previous evaluations." 
</P>
<P>
Twice, the UCLA Archeological Information Center surveyed its archival 
collection of published accounts and records and found no mention of a village 
or burial ground at the depot site. Whittier commissioned the first study when 
it targeted the Whittier Boulevard area for redevelopment in 1978. The second 
study was part of a street-widening project near the Whittier Quad shopping 
area earlier this year. 
</P>
<P>
"Usually, a large archeological site doesn't escape the eyes of archeologists 
and researchers," said Brian Glenn, the center's acting coordinator. 
</P>
<P>
"We have not documented any remains at that location. That doesn't mean they 
don't exist. It simply means that whatever documentation is available is not on 
file at our office." 
</P>
<P>
Glenn noted that the depot vicinity had been a highly developed commercial and 
residential area for years and that an earlier site could have been destroyed 
without proper documentation before preservation became an issue. 
</P>
<P>
"We have more names of villages than we have places located," he said. "A great 
number of villages are probably fully destroyed under Los Angeles. But there's 
also an excellent chance that some sites are preserved." 
</P>
<P>
Lopez, 53 and a Gabrielino Indian who lives in South Whittier, said she has 
documentary evidence supporting her belief that one such Indian burial ground 
lies under or near the depot. 
</P>
<P>
Lopez turned to page 210 of a 1978 edition of "Chinigchinich," a book little 
known outside of Indian and archeological circles. 
</P>
<P>
The title refers to the name of a prophet figure for the local tribes, 
anthropology consultant Chester King said. 
</P>
<P>
The book's author was missionary Geronimo Boscana. More than 150 years ago, 
Father Boscana, writing in Spanish, recorded his observations of the "beliefs, 
usages, customs and extravagancies" of local Indians. His notes were translated 
into English and published in 1846. 
</P>
<P>
Later, ethnographer John Harrington, starting about 1913, annotated Boscana's 
work. One such note refers to an Indian burial ground: 
</P>
<P>
"In the vicinity of the Southern Pacific junction tower, which stands in the 
western angle of the crossing of the Whittier spur of the Southern Pacific with 
the Santa Fe Railway, there is another Indian graveyard. A Mr. Cooper tried to 
make a cesspool there and found the ground full of Indian bones." 
</P>
<P>
Lopez and Castillo believe that Whittier's depot is what the text calls the 
Southern Pacific junction tower. 
</P>
<P>
Whittier officials, based on UCLA research, disagreed, placing the possible 
burial ground south of Whittier, in the northern part of Santa Fe Springs. That 
section of Santa Fe Springs contains a few houses, a sandwich stand and 
industrial buildings. 
</P>
<P>
Don Powell, city manager of Santa Fe Springs, said he cannot recall 
construction in that area that would have required deep excavation. 
</P>
<P>
Castillo, like Lopez, places little faith in expert opinion. 
</P>
<P>
Whittier officials "kept telling me they would go ahead with the development," 
Castillo said. "I decided to come forward and protect my ancestors' burial 
sites. According to our faith, the development would disturb the spirits of our 
ancestors, which in turn would disturb the spirits of the living." 
</P>
<P>
Castillo, 47, an unemployed cabinetmaker, said he only recently began studying 
his Indian heritage after a lifetime of drug and alcohol abuse that he said 
wrecked his marriage and separated him from his family. 
</P>
<P>
"Since I've been sober," the Whittier native said, "I've been getting back into 
my culture and everything." 
</P>
<P>
He recently entered the depot site, he said, to conduct a religious ceremony 
that involved burning sweet grass and sage. "I felt a spiritual belonging, 
almost a feeling of being at home. I looked behind my left boot, and there 
lying on the ground was a tail feather of a red-tailed hawk, which I believe 
was a sign." 
</P>
<P>
Some city officials have privately expressed skepticism about the burial 
ground, wondering whether the issue represented a last-ditch effort by 
activists who opposed moving the depot or disliked the shopping center project. 
</P>
<P>
Castillo acknowledged sympathy with residents who want the depot to stay put: 
"I am for preserving history. I would prefer to see the depot refurbished where 
it sits, and perhaps plant some green grass around it, and put in walkways and 
trees." 
</P>
<P>
Archeologist Jeanette McKenna, a supporter of Castillo's efforts, has also 
opposed moving the depot and approving the shopping center. 
</P>
<P>
"I don't think the (shopping center) design reflects the community of 
Whittier," she said. "It doesn't reflect a small Quaker town. It's more 
designed for an open area of Orange County, with lots of stucco and blank wall 
space." 
</P>
<P>
Representatives of the developer, Encino-based Urbatec, could not be reached 
for comment. 
</P>
<P>
If remains are found, the first person with jurisdiction is the county coroner, 
who would make sure that the corpse is not recent. The coroner would then 
contact the Native American Heritage Commission in Sacramento, which would 
search for what it terms "the most likely descendants." 
</P>
<P>
There are about five such designated Gabrielino descendants in Los Angeles 
County. Castillo is one of up to 3,000 identified Gabrielinos in Southern 
California who do not yet have that designation. 
</P>
<P>
Gabrielino Indians got their name from their close association with the San 
Gabriel Mission. Their most direct ancestors may have migrated here up to 3,000 
years ago, said anthropological consultant King, whose dissertation work was on 
local tribes. 
</P>
<P>
Before the mission era in the late 1700s, he said, there was about one Indian 
village per six square miles in the Los Angeles Basin. Communities ranged from 
15 to 300 people. 
</P>
<P>
He also estimates that there was a stable population of 3,000 Gabrielino 
Indians until diseases imported by colonists decimated them. 
</P>
<P>
The missionaries turned the Indians, who were hunter/gatherers, into farmers 
and cattle herders, King said, adding that Indians were pressed to leave behind 
native cultural practices and abandon villages and burial grounds. 
</P>
<P>
Lopez said: "Rather than be known as Indians, which at the time was lower than 
dirt, they became Mexican or Spanish." 
</P>
<P>
Until recently, there was not much respect for Indian burial grounds either, 
said Larry Myers, the executive secretary of the state's Native American 
Heritage Commission. 
</P>
<P>
"Indian burial grounds were not treated the same as other burial grounds. 
There's been a tremendous amount of desecration," he said, not only by 
developers but by museums that have collected Indian bones. 
</P>
<P>
Under current law, it is a felony to willfully destroy Indian remains in a 
burial site. Most often, descendants reach a compromise with a developer to 
relocate the bones, bury them deeper at the site or build around them. 
</P>
<P>
"There are mediators that will work with tribes and developers to take care of 
both interests," City Councilman Bob Henderson said. "It's one of those things 
that is going to have to be checked." 
</P>
