Flash floods forced hundreds of Fourth of July campers out of the Blue Ridge 
Mountains of North Carolina, and some had to be ferried across swollen streams 
by kayak after more than a week of heavy rain across the South.

<P>
Hundreds more were still out of their homes elsewhere because of flooding 
caused by the remnants of Tropical Storm Allison.

The death toll since Allison sloshed ashore in Texas a week ago rose to 13 -- 
one in North Carolina, five in Mississippi, four in Texas and three in 
Louisiana.

At least 700 Louisiana homes have been flooded, and about 500 people remained 
flooded out of their homes in Liberty County, Tex., authorities said.

Campers were evacuated from three steeply mountainous counties of western North 
Carolina. One woman drowned when her tent was washed away, but her husband was 
rescued. Divers searched for her body and those of possible other victims.

<P>
Several agencies and volunteers used kayaks to take campers across rapidly 
rising streams.

The remnants of Allison had brought more than 1.5 inches of rain to the 
mountains since Monday, causing some mudslides. The National Weather Service 
said up to 4 inches of rain were likely in some areas.
