The revelry of New Year's Eve is expected tonight as Orange Countians usher in 
the new decade. Along with the annual fun and festivities invariably comes 
those who try to drive home drunk. 
</P>
<P>
To that end the California Highway Patrol has stepped up its enforcement 
efforts. Local officials say 75% of the department's available manpower will be 
on the road tonight. Drunk drivers will have one more obstacle come midnight, 
as a new state law takes effect that lowers the legal blood alcohol limit from 
0.10 to 0.08.

Those too drunk to drive may call (800) 422-4143 from 7 p.m. to 3 a.m. nightly 
tonight and Monday to get a free cab ride from any public place to their home. 
The free rides are limited to a 20-mile radius with riders picking up the cost 
for additional miles. The service is co-sponsored by Mothers Against Drunk 
Driving and CareUnit Hospital of Orange.

Also offering free rides home are Yellow Cab of North Orange County and Orange 
Coast Yellow Cab under a program sponsored by local beer and wine wholesalers.
