A Soviet pilot suffering a pre-cancerous condition because of his heroic 
flights to staunch radiation from the Chernobyl nuclear plant underwent a 
transplant of bone marrow rushed from a French donor on Friday. 
</P>
<P>
Four years and a day after the Chernobyl disaster, marrow donated by a 
42-year-old woman was flown to Seattle on Friday for transfusion into Anatoly 
Grishchenko. 
</P>
<P>
The marrow arrived at Seattle-Tacoma International Airport on a British Airways 
flight originating in Paris. 
</P>
<P>
The marrow arrived one day after the fourth anniversary of the Chernobyl 
nuclear disaster in the Ukraine. The transplant procedure was expected to take 
from two to 10 hours. 
</P>
<P>
In September, 1988, Grishchenko was found to have a pre-leukemia condition, 
typified by low counts of blood platelets needed for clotting and of white 
blood cells to fight infection and disease. 
</P>
<P>
Grishchenko, 53, is the first Chernobyl victim to receive medical care in the 
United States. He has up to a 75% chance of survival without a recurrence of 
the condition for five years, said Susan Edmonds of the Fred Hutchinson Cancer 
Research Center. 
</P>
<P>
The transplant was arranged by Cap Parlier, light helicopter testing and 
evaluation director for McDonnell Douglas Corp., who said he spoke with 
Grishchenko by telephone a few hours before the transfusion was set to begin. 
</P>
<P>
The Soviet civilian helicopter test pilot, who arrived at Hutchinson on April 
11, underwent a final round of radiation therapy Friday afternoon, Parlier 
said. 
</P>
<P>
Grishchenko was honored as a Soviet hero for making five flights over Chernobyl 
in the four days after an explosion and fire at the reactor on April 26, 1986. 
</P>
<P>
He flew repeatedly through the hot radioactive gases spewing from the plant to 
survey the damage and to dump tons of sand and wet concrete onto the wreckage. 
</P>
<P>
According to official figures, 31 people were killed. Unofficial reports said 
at least 250 died.
