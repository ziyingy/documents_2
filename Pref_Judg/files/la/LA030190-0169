A state Indian agency will work with local tribes to help rebury Indian bones 
that are now stored in a Santa Ana warehouse. 
</P>
<P>
The Native American Heritage Commission in Sacramento will determine which 
tribe is the most likely descendant of people whose remains were found by 
archeologist Arthur Sanger on San Nicolas Island in the 1950s, said Larry 
Myers, director of the commission. 
</P>
<P>
The commission will talk to representatives from the Gabrielino tribe from 
Catalina Island and the Chumash tribe from the Channel Islands to make the 
determination, Myers said.

Sanger left the bones to his niece, Betty Feldman, who stored them at a 
warehouse in an industrial park on South Edinger Avenue.

Bowers Museum officials learned about the bones three weeks ago when a woman, 
who did not want to be identified, contacted officials after her son was hired 
to move several boxes of Indian bones to the warehouse, said Paul Apodaca, 
curator for the museum's folk art department.

The woman told museum officials that the bones were tossed about during the 
move, Apodaca said. 
</P>
<P>
"The woman thought that it was undignified for the Indian remains to be loaded 
in boxes and fooled around with," Apodaca said. 
</P>
<P>
Apodaca then contacted the coroner's office, which referred the case to the 
state commission after investigators determined that the remains were not 
homicide-related. 
</P>
<P>
Deputy Coroner Bruce Lyle said Feldman had legal ownership of the bones. 
Feldman has agreed to release the bones to the commission, which will find the 
appropriate tribe to take them, Myers said.LILY ENG
