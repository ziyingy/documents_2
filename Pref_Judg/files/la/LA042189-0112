The United States said Panama has sharply curbed visits by Americans in order 
to obstruct monitoring of the May 7 presidential election. State Department 
spokesman Richard Boucher said the move by the regime of Gen. Manuel A. Noriega 
"is an effort to insulate Panama's electoral process from any credible degree 
of public scrutiny." The department also said that Panama is printing false 
voter lists, changing data in voting registries, providing insufficient ballots 
for opposition candidates and using military personnel to campaign illegally.
