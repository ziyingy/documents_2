Amnesty International accused Iraq and five other countries of the widespread 
use of death squads. The London-based group told the U.N. Human Rights 
Commission in Geneva that most death squads, while appearing to operate 
independently, actually are set up by government security forces and are 
directed and manned by soldiers or police. The human rights group singled out 
Iraq as having the worst reputation for use of the squads -- "clearly and 
incontrovertibly, (it) presents a situation of the most flagrant and massive 
violation of human rights" -- but it also named Colombia, El Salvador, Peru, 
Ethiopia and Burma.
