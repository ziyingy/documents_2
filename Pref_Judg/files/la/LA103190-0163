Scientists have pinpointed a rare, genetic flaw that makes people unusually 
sensitive to sunlight and predisposes them to skin cancer, it was reported 
today. 
</P>
<P>
A Japanese team headed by Kiyoji Tanaka at Osaka University said it has 
discovered and made copies of a gene that when defective causes the most common 
type of a disease called xeroderma pigmentosum. 
</P>
<P>
About one in 250,000 people suffer from xeroderma pigmentosum, an inherited 
disease in which skin cells lack the normal ability to repair the damage the 
sun's ultraviolet light inflicts on genetic material. 
</P>
<P>
People with xeroderma pigmentosum must avoid exposure to sunlight. If they fail 
to do so, they run a high risk of developing skin cancer and potentially 
blinding growths on the eyelids and cornea.
