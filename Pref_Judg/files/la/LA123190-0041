The cold snap that already has devastated this year's citrus crop could also 
dramatically curtail the number of lemons, oranges and avocados produced next 
year, farmers and agricultural officials said Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
Some farmers expect their citrus production to be half of normal next year 
because the cold weather is killing young orange and lemon trees and ravaging 
new growth on older trees. 
</P>
<P>
Avocado production in Tulare County is likely to be wiped out for 1991, said 
county agricultural commissioner Lenord Craft. Tulare farms about 11,000 acres 
of avocados, which are a $3-million crop annually. 
</P>
<P>
"We are looking at not even having an avocado crop in Tulare next year," Craft 
said. 
</P>
<P>
Farmers interviewed Sunday said they were no longer trying to save this year's 
fruit. What was still on the trees -- for navel oranges, about 80% of the crop 
-- is nearly all lost, farmers said. 
</P>
<P>
"I didn't pick an orange," said Keith Nilmeier, a Fresno citrus grower. "We 
gave up on our field." 
</P>
<P>
Farmers said they were concentrating on saving their trees. If the trees die in 
great numbers, it could have a long-range impact on the state's fruit 
production and its economy. California produces about half the nation's fruit 
and vegetables, supporting a $17.5-billion industry. 
</P>
<P>
The economic toll of the recent freeze is expected to top $1 billion. Oranges 
and lemons worth hundreds of millions of dollars have been destroyed. Acre upon 
acre of broccoli, artichokes and celery are lost. About 15,000 Northern 
California farm workers are expected to lose their jobs, and innumerable others 
are losing business in a wide array of related industries such as trucking and 
shipping. 
</P>
<P>
The impact in future years should be considerably less. But if fruit production 
is substantially curtailed in 1991, it will mean fewer jobs for pickers, 
packers, truckers, crate manufacturers and many others. 
</P>
<P>
The biggest long-range concern is the health of citrus and avocado trees, 
farmers said. It takes up to five years to bring new trees into full fruit 
production, therefore lost trees set farmers back significantly. 
</P>
<P>
At this point, farmers have no way of knowing how many trees will die. Most 
believe that they will not be able to tally their losses until spring. Many 
already have seen bark splitting and cracking, which means that the new growth 
-- which supports next year's crop -- is in jeopardy. 
</P>
<P>
"We have some severe bark-splitting in both the lemons and the oranges," said 
Lee Bailey, of Bailey Brothers, a large citrus grower in Orange Cove. "We'd be 
lucky to have half to a third of our crop next year." 
</P>
<P>
Farmers continue to battle the cold. Although temperatures were rising this 
weekend, many areas were plagued with below-freezing weather. 
</P>
<P>
Lows reported early Sunday by the National Weather Service include 16 degrees 
in Lancaster, 18 in Redding, 25 in Fresno, 24 in Stockton and Sacramento, 26 in 
Bakersfield and 30 in Imperial. Temperatures are expected to rise during this 
week into the 40s and 50s through much of Northern California, where the freeze 
hit hardest. 
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Southern California is enjoying much milder weather, which is 
expected to continue for at least several days, said National Weather Service 
specialist Betty Reo. The high temperature today is expected to reach the mid 
to high 60s at the Los Angeles Civic Center. New Year's Day should dawn chilly 
but warm later to the low 70s. 
</P>
<P>
A second storm that was expected to hit this weekend was not as severe as 
anticipated. "The storm went due east and we just got the tail end of the 
effects," Reo said. A northeasterly wind helped keep temperatures up, she 
added. 
</P>
<P>
Ventura County farmers were spared further damage to hard-hit crops during the 
first week of winter. 
</P>
<P>
"We seem to have dodged a major bullet," said a relieved Rex Laird, executive 
director of the Ventura County Farm Bureau. "We were expecting a front that was 
going to be even colder than the one that hit us last week. But it seems to 
have veered over toward Arizona." 
</P>
<P>
As a result, he said, the county's farmers -- some of whom stayed up all night 
Saturday prepared to turn on smudge pots and wind machines -- reported no 
significant damage from the latest edition of the so-called Yukon Express. 
</P>
<P>
For the next week, the farmers' improved luck should hold, said National 
Weather Service meteorologist Terry Schaeffer. He predicted gradually 
moderating temperatures, with westerly winds bringing increased humidity by the 
end of the week. Such conditions generally favor farmers, he said. 
</P>
<P>
Although Northern California temperatures are still worrisome to farmers, they 
are substantially better than what had been expected only days ago, when 
weather forecasts called for another weekend of freezing cold. 
</P>
<P>
Farmers said they were using wind machines and water to raise field 
temperatures the few degrees needed to save the older trees. Young trees around 
the perimeter of many farms are already lost, farmers said. Some estimated that 
as many as 20% of the 3- to 4-year-old trees also would fall victim to the 
cold. 
</P>
<P>
"There is quite a bit of die-back," said Craft. "The trees that are under 4 
years old that were unprotected are going to die. But some trees that were 
protected will do fine. We don't have any way of estimating at this point what 
percentage of the trees are hurt." 
</P>
<P>
Vegetable crops also have been severely damaged by the freeze. Farmers said 
there would only be a short-term impact from the loss of broccoli, celery and 
artichoke crops because these vegetables are planted and harvested in 
three-month cycles. 
</P>
<P>
Trees are another story. 
</P>
<P>
"We are just trying to maintain the integrity of our bud woods," said Nilmeier. 
"The mature trees won't die, but we could be looking at a half-crop or less for 
next year."
