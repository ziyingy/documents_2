A Simi Valley drunk driver who caused a collision that killed the mother of 
three young children was sentenced Wednesday to seven years in state prison. 
</P>
<P>
Roberto Zamora, 23, had a blood alcohol level of 0.20 -- twice the legal limit 
-- when he caused a collision in May that left Anne Adkins, 30, dead. He had 
been driving as fast 80 to 100 m.p.h. on the Simi Valley Freeway when he 
swerved into another lane and hit a car that plowed into Adkins' vehicle. 
</P>
<P>
Zamora pleaded guilty to one count of vehicular manslaughter last month in San 
Fernando Superior Court. 
</P>
<P>
Adkins' 4-year-old son was in the back seat of the car and survived the 
accident. 
</P>
<P>
In a letter read to the court Wednesday, Adkins' mother, Gloria DeHart, said 
the child is haunted by the experience. Frequently he wakes up at night 
screaming, "Don't look. Mommy is dead," the letter said.

<P>
Child Panics 
</P>
<P>
If his father comes home from work late, the child panics and screams, 
imagining perhaps that his father has been killed too, the letter said. 
</P>
<P>
Adkins also left behind two daughters, ages 12 and 8, and her husband of 13 
years. 
</P>
<P>
Members of Adkins' family and Deputy Dist. Atty. Ken Barshop pleaded with Judge 
John Farrell to sentence Zamora to the maximum prison term of twelve years. 
</P>
<P>
But Farrell imposed the lesser sentence of seven years, he said, because Zamora 
had no prior criminal record and never had been arrested for any driving or 
alcohol-related offenses. The judge also said that Zamora had pleaded guilty, 
sparing the victim's family the pain of a trial. 
</P>
<P>
"My heart goes out to the victims, but the legally correct thing to do" was to 
impose the lesser sentence, Farrell said. Under state law, he said, judges are 
supposed to impose a sentence shorter than the maximum unless they find that 
aggravating factors, such as previous convictions, exist.
