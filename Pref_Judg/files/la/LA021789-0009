A 30 share for Jesus?

From Jimmy Swaggart to Jim and Tammy Bakker, the fundamentalist TV preaching 
industry can't seem to get a break these days -- even on TV. 
</P>
<P>
Now comes HBO's brash, mocking and darkly funny miniseries "Glory! Glory!" (9 
p.m. Sunday and Monday) that seems to make its fictional praise-the-buck 
electronic ministry a grim metaphor for all of society. And in doing so -- with 
strong intonations of Paddy Chayefsky's visionary "Network" -- it affirms TV's 
mind-fuzzing seductiveness, whereby the medium itself assumes spirituality, 
inspiring trust and worship. 
</P>
<P>
In this scenario, TV is not merely the message, it's the religion. 
</P>
<P>
When fiery, magnetic, faith-healing Rev. Dan Stuckey (Barry Morse) is felled by 
a stroke, leadership of his rich Church of the Companions of Christ TV empire 
in Waco, Tex., falls to his son, the pious and earnest, but bland, Rev. Bobby 
Joe (Richard Thomas). Donations, once $1 million a day, swiftly fall under 
Bobby Joe, and the ministry is near collapse until he recruits a boozing, 
coke-headed rock singer (Ellen Greene) to juice up his TV services. 
</P>
<P>
Sister Ruth, as she becomes known, uses her street-tough coarseness and singing 
to rejuvenate the ministry financially and to rise from the ashes of her own 
life. She also transforms herself and the church into TV phenomena that even 
attract the notice of a giant network: "This lady can do for us what Cosby did 
for NBC," an executive proclaims. 
</P>
<P>
Watching Greene, you believe it. She is raw, biting and sexy as Ruth, offering 
raspy eloquence as a singer while making an odd coupling with Thomas' mild, 
sniveling Bobby Joe. And James Whitmore is a scene stealer as Lester Babbitt, 
the pragmatic, manipulative church elder who is a consummate con man and the 
real brains behind the ministry. 
</P>
<P>
That "Glory! Glory!" periodically meanders and loses focus is undeniable. 
Written by Stan Daniels and directed by Lindsay Anderson, the 3 1/2-hour 
musical satire could be much tighter and firmer. It doesn't help that a key 
element of the story, in which the ministry is investigated by a TV reporter 
(Winston Rekert), bends credibility to the snapping point. Nor, surely, is 
there anything revolutionary about the fusion of religion and rock music. 
</P>
<P>
Yet "Glory! Glory!" is lively, thoroughly arresting, always interesting, 
sometimes inspired TV that strengthens HBO's standing as the medium's bold 
provocateur. Whereas 1982's "Pray TV" on ABC was weak and soggy, "Glory! 
Glory!" is energized by Steve Tyrell's music, Greene's bracing performance and 
the frequent sharp humor of Daniels' script. 
</P>
<P>
Sister Ruth becomes a recording star, one of her hit albums being titled "Satan 
Sucks." And when she coaches an actor on how to appear "healed" on TV, it's 
hilarious: "Let me see you gnarl your fingers . . . good! Good gnarling!" 
</P>
<P>
All the while, network executives consider Bobby Joe a dull "lox" and plot to 
turn him into a "sort of Christian Ed Sullivan" whose only role would be to 
introduce Sister Ruth. 
</P>
<P>
Along with the humor come dark omens and simmering pessimism, for everyone in 
this deeply cynical comedy/drama is viewed as ultimately corruptible. 
Characters temporarily occupy a moral high ground, only to topple to temptation 
just as "Glory! Glory!" seems on the verge of affirming their faith. 
</P>
<P>
"What we do, we do in a holy cause," Lester declares, articulating the eternal 
justification for using evil means in pursuit of honorable ends. 
</P>
<P>
As he speaks these words, images of real-life disgraced TV preachers flash in 
your mind -- preachers who constitute a distinct, but highly visible, minority 
among their fellow clergy. Yet by implication, this HBO production unfairly 
seems to extend its vision of bleakness, hypocrisy and dirty tricks to all 
electronic clergy. 
</P>
<P>
On "Glory! Glory!" meanwhile, it's always showtime in front of the cameras. An 
actor playing Jesus is affixed to a cross outlined in spotlights, as the line 
separating God and ratings continues to blur.
