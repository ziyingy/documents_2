As the U.S. Supreme Court considers a new ruling on legal abortion, the issue 
is flaring in Western Europe, with church-backed groups fighting to limit laws 
that have made the procedure widely available. 
</P>
<P>
The issue has touched off street demonstrations in Italy, threatened the 
stability of Belgium's government and prompted a debate in West Germany, where 
authorities have cracked down on violators of the abortion law. 
</P>
<P>
But in many other parts of the world, it is barely an issue, either because of 
a consensus that it is wrong or a broad acceptance of abortion as a form of 
birth control. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
High Level in China 
</P>
<P>
In the Soviet Bloc and China, for example, abortion has reached high levels -- 
one for every two live births in China -- but it is widely accepted. Even in 
overwhelmingly Roman Catholic Poland, the practice is widespread, although 
there is a drive under way to ban it. 
</P>
<P>
The Roman Catholic Church has been the principal force behind worldwide 
campaigning against abortion. 
</P>
<P>
"The protection and defense of the human person -- every person and the whole 
person, especially those who are vulnerable and most helpless -- this is a task 
which the Catholic Church, in the name of Christ, cannot and will not forsake," 
Pope John Paul II said last month, reaffirming the church's total ban on 
abortion. 
</P>
<P>
In the United States, church-backed groups have played a key role in a vocal 
campaign against the 1973 Roe vs. Wade decision, which legalized abortion. The 
Supreme Court in Washington is considering a case that could weaken Roe; it is 
expected to rule this month. 
</P>
<P>
Abortion became legal in many Western European countries in the 1970s and early 
1980s. But, as in the United States, legalization has not tempered the debate. 
</P>
<P>
In Italy, hundreds of thousands of protesters thronged the streets of Rome this 
spring in the biggest demonstrations for and against abortion since 1981, when 
Italians voted in a referendum to uphold abortion on demand in the first three 
months of pregnancy. 
</P>
<P>
Health Minister Carlo Donat Cattin, a member of the Christian Democrat Party, 
has joined religious groups and conservatives in calling for limits on the law. 
Pro-choice demonstrators have countered, protesting "loopholes" in the law they 
blame for a growing number of "back alley" abortions. 
</P>
<P>
In Belgium, a 16-year battle to legalize abortion realized its first victory in 
May when two Senate committees voted to allow abortion in cases of 
psychological or economic distress. 
</P>
<P>
But the measure is fiercely opposed by Belgium's dominant Christian Democrats, 
a Catholic-inspired party. The issue could bring down the coalition government. 
</P>
<P>
In Western Europe, as in the United States, restrictions on abortion have not 
prevented women from getting them elsewhere. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Flocking to Netherlands 
</P>
<P>
For example, many Belgians go next door to the Netherlands, where abortion laws 
are more liberal. Dutch hospitals performed 36,455 abortions in 1986, 21,655 of 
them for foreigners. 
</P>
<P>
And in Britain, doctors performed 3,673 abortions in 1987 for women from 
Ireland, where the operation is illegal. 
</P>
<P>
The abortion issue returned to the front pages in West Germany in May, when a 
Bavarian court convicted Dr. Horst Theissen of performing abortions without 
proof that the women had been counseled by at least two doctors, as required by 
law. 
</P>
<P>
The state of Bavaria, which is 70% Catholic, also indicted 156 of Theissen's 
patients on charges of getting abortions without the required counseling. Most 
were fined. The cases prompted rallies by pro-choice groups and criticism from 
the country's main opposition party, the Social Democrats. 
</P>
<P>
Abortion is a common means of birth control in the Soviet Bloc. Even in Poland, 
where more than 90% of the population considers itself Catholic, an estimated 
one in two pregnancies is terminated by abortion -- one of the highest rates in 
the world. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Effect of Housing Shortage 
</P>
<P>
A severe housing shortage and erratic supplies of contraceptives contribute to 
the rate. 
</P>
<P>
Poland's Parliament is considering legislation backed by the Catholic Church to 
make abortion a crime. Both pro- and anti-abortion groups have held 
demonstrations. 
</P>
<P>
In the Soviet Union, women average six to nine abortions each during their 
child-bearing years, according to Western estimates. 
</P>
<P>
The country's top-ranking woman, candidate Politburo member Alexandra P. 
Biryukova, has complained about the number and blamed it on a shortage of 
contraceptives. 
</P>
<P>
Abortion was legalized in many East Bloc countries in the 1950s, but 
contraceptives were not generally available until the 1970s, said Jeremy 
Hamand, publications director of the London-based International Planned 
Parenthood Federation. 
</P>
<P>
"When they did come in, there was a whole generation of women who had 
controlled their fertility by abortion," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Several Asian countries outlaw abortion, but it is widely practiced in Japan 
and China. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
'Like Dentist Appointment' 
</P>
<P>
"It was like making an appointment at the dentist," said one college student 
who recently had an abortion in Tokyo. 
</P>
<P>
Japan bans the birth control pill because of possible side effects. The 
country's main religions, Buddhism and Shintoism, do not condemn abortion, and 
it carries no social stigma. 
</P>
<P>
The Health Ministry in Tokyo says Japan had 17.8 registered abortions for every 
1,000 women aged 15 to 49 in 1985. However, many abortions go unreported, 
doctors say. Japan's rate might exceed that of the United States, which had 24 
terminated pregnancies for every 1,000 females of child-bearing age that year. 
</P>
<P>
Abortion is a major form of population control in China, where more than 10 
million abortions are performed each year. Although there is some individual 
resistance to government pressures to abort unplanned babies, there are no 
anti-abortion groups, and the main criticism of the rate has come from the 
United States. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
High Mortality Rate 
</P>
<P>
In predominantly Catholic Latin America, abortion is widely illegal except for 
cases in which the woman's life is in danger or she is a victim of rape. There 
has been little or no movement to expand those conditions.
