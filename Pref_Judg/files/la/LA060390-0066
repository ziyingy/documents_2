<P>
U.S. and Soviet officials said Saturday that negotiators have broken a deadlock 
and moved closer to a historic agreement to slash troop levels and conventional 
weapons in Europe. 
</P>
<P>
There was no official announcement of the development as President Bush and 
Soviet leader Mikhail S. Gorbachev concluded three days of summit meetings with 
an informal session at the Camp David retreat in Maryland. However, a ranking 
Soviet official said in an interview, "The stalemate you Americans talked about 
is over. I don't think any problems remain." 
</P>
<P>
U.S. officials were far more cautious in their assessment. "The deal is not 
done yet," a senior American official cautioned, but he confirmed that the 
impasse was broken. 
</P>
<P>
Bush and Gorbachev, preparing to return to Washington after about 10 hours of 
wide-ranging discussions at the retreat, declared that they had deepened their 
understanding of each other's positions on what the Soviet leader had called 
"the global flash points." 
</P>
<P>
"We have an awful lot of common ground," Bush said. 
</P>
<P>
Calling the day "very instructive," Gorbachev said, "I think there is really 
ample opportunity for cooperation even though there are real problems that 
neither the President nor I can turn a blind eye to." 
</P>
<P>
Questioned by reporters, Bush sharply defended his decision to proceed with a 
trade agreement with Moscow despite the continuing economic embargo of 
Lithuania. 
</P>
<P>
"I look at the overall relationship," Bush said, asserting that the trade 
accord is "in the interest of the United States." 
</P>
<P>
"Somebody wants to argue with me, fine, we'll take him on," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Bush and Gorbachev did not comment publicly on the conventional arms issue. In 
Washington, an American official said substantial progress was made toward 
agreements on limiting numbers of tanks, destruction of weapons that are taken 
out of service and the issue of verifying destruction of weapons. Unresolved, 
he said, were limits on aircraft, probably the most complex topic facing the 
conventional arms talks. 
</P>
<P>
The progress toward a treaty to reduce conventional forces -- one of the 
superpowers' chief arms control goals this year -- comes as another positive 
note in U.S.-Soviet relations at a summit that both sides already were hailing 
as a success. 
</P>
<P>
It helped to counterbalance continuing differences over several other major 
issues, including two of the most vexing of the relationship: whether a unified 
Germany will be a member of the North Atlantic Treaty Organization, and Soviet 
handling of the independence movement in the Baltic states. 
</P>
<P>
Bush and Gorbachev again took up Lithuania and Germany during their more than 
eight hours of discussions Saturday at the presidential retreat, an 
Administration official said, but only to go over what they will say at a joint 
press conference at the White House today -- the climax of the summit. 
</P>
<P>
Soviet officials have said they expect two more Bush-Gorbachev summits to be 
held later this year, one to sign a treaty reducing conventional forces, 
assuming it is completed this year, and another at Moscow to sign a treaty 
drastically reducing strategic or long-range nuclear weapons (START). The 
conventional forces pact would be signed, probably in Paris, at a meeting of 
the heads of all 35 nations of the Conference on Security and Cooperation in 
Europe. 
</P>
<P>
On Friday the two leaders signed a framework for a START treaty and indicated 
that they thought they had narrowed their differences on remaining issues. 
Although some sources suggested the Moscow summit would be officially announced 
today, an Administration official, speaking on condition of anonymity, said 
such a meeting could not be announced until it is certain that a START treaty 
will be ready for signing this year. 
</P>
<P>
In the sunshine and relaxed setting of Camp David, the two presidents removed 
their ties and sat around a large patio table Saturday as they discussed a wide 
ranging of regional issues, touching on Afghanistan, Cambodia, Cuba, Nicaragua, 
El Salvador, India and Pakistan, and the Middle East. 
</P>
<P>
It was "not in a sense of dividing up the world," Bush said. "Maybe that would 
have happened years ago. In terms of ironing the problems, achieving common 
ground, as we looked at a lot of regional problems." 
</P>
<P>
"It's been a big day," Gorbachev said. 
</P>
<P>
Bush quipped that he had only one disappointment from their time together -- 
that coming at the camp's horseshoe pit. The Soviet president, who never played 
the sport before, "literally, threw a ringer the first time," Bush gasped. 
"There's not much more to say." 
</P>
<P>
In an earlier briefing for reporters, Marlin Fitzwater, Bush's press secretary, 
said the President and the Soviet leader included a thorough discussion of 
human rights in their Saturday session. 
</P>
<P>
They discussed ways to increase the number of Jews emigrating from the Soviet 
Union and "talked about direct flights to Israel and the general problems about 
allowing emigration to be as free and open as possible," Fitzwater said. 
</P>
<P>
Bush noted that the United States is accepting about 70,000 emigres annually 
now compared to 14,000 a few years ago, Fitzwater said, adding that "we 
continue to want to take more." 
</P>
<P>
During the day, U.S. and Soviet officials also issued a joint statement 
announcing a new cooperative effort to ferry relief supplies to Ethiopian 
famine victims. The statement said U.S. food would be hauled to stricken areas 
on Soviet aircraft "to demonstrate our joint commitment to responding to this 
tragic humanitarian problem." 
</P>
<P>
U.S. and Soviet negotiators plan to brief their allies on the results of the 
talks on Monday. Unlike the superpower negotiations over reduction of 
long-range nuclear weapons, the Conventional Forces in Europe conference is a 
multinational affair including the 16 members of NATO and the seven members of 
the Warsaw Pact. 
</P>
<P>
A senior U.S. official said American and Soviet negotiators reached tentative 
agreements defining classes of tanks and armored vehicles and establishing 
limitations on them. But he said nothing can be considered final until the 
other NATO nations give their approval. 
</P>
<P>
"Most of those are likely to be acceptable to the allies, but there are at 
least one or two that will require some careful study and may or may not work," 
the official said. "On some of these issues, ceilings and weights, allied 
equipment is affected more than American equipment." 
</P>
<P>
The Soviet official said that difficulties may develop between Washington and 
its allies. 
</P>
<P>
"We don't have that problem any more," he added in a somewhat rueful reference 
to the disintegration of the Warsaw Pact -- which has left Moscow virtually 
without allies. 
</P>
<P>
Bush and Gorbachev signed a joint statement Friday fixing a goal of completion 
of a conventional arms pact by the end of this year. 
</P>
<P>
Although it has often been overlooked by a world public preoccupied with the 
destructive power of nuclear weapons, the sophistication and destructive power 
of non-nuclear arms in Europe has mushroomed during the years of the Cold War. 
Western leaders see the Vienna talks as an opportunity to roll back Soviet 
power in Europe and end the hair-trigger confrontation that has lasted for more 
than a generation. 
</P>
<P>
"A war in Europe would mean total, irreversible catastrophe," Valentin M. 
Falin, head of the international department of the Soviet Communist Party, said 
Saturday.
