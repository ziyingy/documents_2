Nothing seemed to work right for Contra Costa County authorities who arrested a 
man on charges of running the most sophisticated drug laboratory ever 
encountered in the county, and then lost him -- and his $150,000 bail -- in a 
series of communications foul-ups and court delays. Barry Starr of Orinda was 
under "house arrest," wearing an electronic monitoring device that would alert 
officials if he left his home between 11 p.m. and 7 a.m. The alarm went off on 
a Friday night but because it was the weekend, the monitoring agency in 
Cincinnati waited until Monday to notify authorities. By that time Starr was 
nowhere to be found. Later, officials learned they couldn't even revoke his 
$150,000 bail. Legal maneuverings had caused court delays and the bail bond 
expired before Starr could be brought into court for a hearing on renewing it. 
Contra Costa County Dist. Atty. Gary Yancey said Starr was arrested in 1988 on 
state charges of manufacturing methamphetamines. He subsequently was indicted 
on federal charges and his case was transferred to federal court. Starr is 
being sought by federal marshals.
