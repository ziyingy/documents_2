<P>
There are at least seven good reasons to plant a fall vegetable garden: 
cabbage, broccoli, cauliflower, Brussels sprouts, kohlrabi, collards and kale. 
</P>
<P>
These cool-weather cole crops are members of the cabbage family ("cole" comes 
from caulis, the Latin name for cabbage). Crisp and crunchy, these vegetables 
flourish from now to early spring. 
</P>
<P>
Although commonly found at markets, many don't arrive fresh, and there are 
varieties with uncommonly good taste that only the home gardener can grow. 
Back-yard cabbage, for example, tastes remarkably sweeter. 
</P>
<P>
Below is a rundown of the cole crops and the best varieties of each for 
Southern California gardens. 
</P>
<P>
Cabbage 
</P>
<P>
Cabbage has been around as a cultivated crop for more than 2,000 years. An 
extremely adaptable vegetable, it thrives in gardens throughout most of the 
world. Seed catalogues in the United States alone list an astronomical 500 
varieties. 
</P>
<P>
Good green cabbage includes Early Jersey Wakefield, Emerald Cross Hybrid, 
Copenhagen Market, Stonehead Hybrid and Early Flat Dutch. 
</P>
<P>
Red cabbage adds color to the garden as well as to the salad bowl. Good red 
cabbage choices include Ruby Ball Hybrid, Ruby Perfection Hybrid and Scarlet 
O'Hara Hybrid. 
</P>
<P>
Savoy cabbages have crinkled foliage and the heads never become really hard. 
Many gardeners and gourmets consider savoy cabbage to have a sweeter, more 
delicate flavor than other cabbages. Savoy Ace, Savoy King and Early Curly 
Hybrid are superior savoy cabbages. 
</P>
<P>
Broccoli 
</P>
<P>
Although broccoli was a prized addition to Roman gardens, it wasn't until the 
1920s that it was introduced to this country. California leads the nation in 
broccoli production. 
</P>
<P>
Broccoli transplants should be spaced 18 inches apart, and the central heads 
should be harvested when the buds are small and tight, before they open into 
tiny yellow flowers. 
</P>
<P>
Green Comet, Premium Corp Hybrid, Di Cicco, Bonanza Hybrid and Green Goliath 
are a quintet of winning broccoli varieties. In addition, Romanesco is an 
unusual Italian broccoli with a head that resembles a clump of individual 
swirls of light green sea coral and features a sweet, delicate flavor. 
</P>
<P>
Cauliflower 
</P>
<P>
Referred to by gourmets as the "prince of the cole crops," cauliflower is 
prized in this country for its pristine white heads. To get those pure white 
heads you have to blanch them: After the heads begin to form, tie the leaves 
over the heads to prevent exposure to the sun. When the heads are exposed to 
the sun, they turn yellow. 
</P>
<P>
Like broccoli, cauliflower plants should be spaced 18 inches apart. Harvest 
cauliflower when the heads are tight and smooth. 
</P>
<P>
Early Snowball A, Snow Crown Hybrid and Snow King Hybrid are a trio of top 
cauliflower choices. If you like the unusual, Purple Head Improved is a unique 
type with a dramatic purple head that turns green when cooked; it requires no 
blanching. 
</P>
<P>
Brussels Sprouts 
</P>
<P>
Brussels sprouts are produced along the stalks of large, unusual looking 
plants. The sprouts, similar to tiny cabbage heads, develop from the bottom of 
the stalk upwards. 
</P>
<P>
It is not unusual for each plant to produce 100 or more sprouts. Because of the 
large plant size, Brussels sprouts transplants should be spaced two feet apart. 
Jade Cross Hybrid, Jade Cross E Hybrid and Oliver Hybrid all produce well in 
the Southland. 
</P>
<P>
Kohlrabi 
</P>
<P>
This unusual looking member of the cole family is grown for its bulbs, which 
are produced on the stems above the ground level. Kohlrabi is not a popular 
vegetable among home gardeners, but it should be. It is fine table fare whether 
eaten raw or cooked and is extremely easy to grow. 
</P>
<P>
Kohlrabi is seldom available as a transplant. It is the most rapid of the cole 
crops to mature, reaching the harvest stage about 50 days after the seed is 
sown. Follow the directions on the seed packet for correct spacing. Grand Duke 
Hybrid is by far the best kohlrabi variety. 
</P>
<P>
Collards 
</P>
<P>
Collards have long been a favorite vegetable in the South and are gaining 
popularity in gardens throughout the country. Rich in vitamins and with few 
calories, the cooked leaves taste somewhat like cabbage, but have a stronger 
mustard flavor. 
</P>
<P>
Collard transplants should be spaced 15 inches apart. Harvest leaves as you 
need them and let the rest of the plant continue to grow. Choose either Georgia 
or Vates; both grow well here. 
</P>
<P>
Kale 
</P>
<P>
Probably the least well-known of the cole crops, kale is unusually rich in 
calcium and other minerals. The plants make attractive landscaping items, and 
nurseries will often feature different varieties of ornamental kale grown for 
garden display. 
</P>
<P>
They are beautiful plants, covering a range of pastel colors. Keep in mind, 
however, that ornamental kale varieties are not primarily designed for table 
fare. While most are edible, they are not nearly as succulent as those 
varieties bred for eating. Dwarf Blue Curled Vates is the best edible type for 
Southern California. 
</P>
<P>
Full sun and a rich, porous soil are necessary for cole crops. Lots of compost, 
redwood shavings or other organic matter should be spaded into the soil. All 
cole crops are heavy feeders and need a complete fertilizer. Water deeply and 
allow soil to settle a few days before planting. 
</P>
<P>
Seed packet directions should be adhered to when sowing seeds. Transplants 
should be buried a little deeper to encourage sturdy stems. 
</P>
<P>
Because the cole crops like water, they should be irrigated deeply between 
rains. Liquid fertilizer applied every three weeks will produce significantly 
bigger crops. 
</P>
<P>
Only cabbage worms are a serious problem during the cool months, but they can 
be easily controlled with a biological spray, that contains Bacillus 
thuringiensis. Products such as Dipel, Thuricide and Attack all contain this 
control. 
</P>
<P>
Seeds or transplants for many of the varieties listed here should be available 
at local nurseries. Seeds for others may be ordered by mail from Burpee Seeds, 
Warminster, Pa. 18974. They offer a free catalogue. 
</P>

GARDENER'S CHECKLIST 
</P>
<P>
 For dedicated gardeners, here are suggestions from the California Assn. of 
Nurserymen on what to do in the garden this week: 
</P>
<P>
Keep fertilizing your lawn on a regular basis. This will help keep it greener 
longer into the cooler season. 
</P>
<P>
Repot older root-bound cacti and succulents. Look for roots peeking out of the 
drain holes. 
</P>
<P>
Look around this fall at what trees are changing leaf color and pick your 
favorite to plant for a color show of your own next year. 
</P>
<P>
As the leaves fall off your deciduous trees, keep them picked up. They harbor 
diseases, and insects love to hide in the decaying foliage. 
</P>
