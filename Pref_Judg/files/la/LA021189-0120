A 296-pound man whose death in police custody set off two nights of street 
violence suffocated partly from the exhaustion of a violent struggle with 
officers and from being bound face-down in a small space, a medical report said 
Friday.

An autopsy disclosed that Edgar Allen Price, 40, asphyxiated Feb. 1 after the 
struggle with eight police officers during an undercover crack cocaine bust. 
Prosecutors are investigating the death to determine if there was any criminal 
negligence or wrongdoing by arresting officers.
