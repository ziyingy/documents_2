<P>
Your recent front page story on AIDS, Laguna Beach and gays came with 
unbelievable timing when you were reporting on the journalistic discrimination 
of racial minorities. Yet you print as "news" sensationalized recollections of 
long-ago wild parties given by Laguna gays in a way that inflame people's sense 
of Christian righteousness, bigotry and hatred. 
</P>
<P>
This is not the responsible reporting that I am used to reading in The Times. 
</P>
<P>
I am a Laguna Beach resident who loves my city. I am straight. I have friends 
in both the straight and gay community. I am actively involved in the fight 
against AIDS. I feel that your recent article must have been published without 
thought about what it might cost: 
</P>
<P>
* Laguna Beach and its fight against AIDS and its fight for human rights. 
</P>
<P>
* Citizens of Laguna Beach who are so proud of their city that they recently 
put together an 80% majority to tax themselves in order to "save the canyon." 
</P>
<P>
I suggest that an in-depth article on AIDS and what the Laguna Beach community 
is doing about it might be appropriate at this time. Laguna is leading the 
nation in this fight and does not deserve the effects this article may bring.
