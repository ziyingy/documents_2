A massive electronic network linking more than 60,000 computers remains 
vulnerable to potentially crippling attack by computer "viruses," the General 
Accounting Office reported Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
The GAO, an investigative arm of Congress, said the White House science adviser 
should oversee efforts to help protect the network, Internet, from sabotage. 
</P>
<P>
It said lax security procedures on Internet contributed to the severity of 
problems that resulted when a software virus "infected" the system last 
November, crippling thousands of computers. 
</P>
<P>
Internet, the main computer network used by the U.S. research community, 
comprises more than 500 national, regional and local networks nationwide and 
overseas. Two of the largest component networks are sponsored by the Pentagon's 
Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency and the National Science Foundation. 
</P>
<P>
The GAO report was released at a hearing of the House Energy and Commerce 
subcommittee on telecommunications and finance. 
</P>
<P>
Jack L. Brock Jr., director of the GAO's government information and financial 
management division, said that since the virus attack last fall, security has 
been strengthened on many computers connected to Internet. However, "we still 
feel that the lack of central control (over security) . . . remains a problem," 
he added. 
</P>
<P>
Computer viruses are usually small strings of code that programmers can use to 
infiltrate a computer's software and replicate a procedure thousands of times, 
causing computer systems to "crash." In some cases the code can destroy 
computer data. 
</P>
<P>
The GAO report noted that currently "there is no lead agency or organization 
responsible for Internet-wide management. Responsibility for computer security 
rests largely with the host sites that own and operate the computers." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
'Interagency Group' 
</P>
<P>
To help ensure needed security improvements, the GAO recommended that the 
President's science adviser, through the White House Office of Science and 
Technology Policy, "coordinate the establishment of an interagency group . . . 
to serve as the Internet security focal point." 
</P>
<P>
It said this group should provide Internet-wide security policy, direction and 
coordination; support continuing efforts to enhance Internet security, and 
become an integral part of the structure that emerges to manage a high-speed 
National Research Network planned for the 1990s.
