Tens of thousands of people, including President Francois Mitterrand and 
survivors of the Holocaust, marched silently through Paris today, protesting 
the recent desecrations of Jewish cemeteries. 
</P>
<P>
Many wore yellow Stars of David. 
</P>
<P>
The march initially was organized in response to vandalism last week at a 
cemetery in the southern town of Carpentras, where tombs were smashed and a 
recently buried body was dug up and mutilated. Another desecration was 
discovered early today at a cemetery near Paris, where obscenities and 
swastikas were painted in red on more than 30 tombs. 
</P>
<P>
Mitterrand's presence -- not announced in advance -- was believed to mark the 
first time since World War II that a French president had joined a public 
demonstration. 
</P>
<P>
Premier Michel Rocard, Chief Rabbi Joseph Sitruk and Roman Catholic Cardinal 
Albery Decourtray were among the throng of marchers who left from the Place de 
la Republique. Rocard said he wanted to help show the world that France's "true 
image" was one of tolerance. 
</P>
<P>
At the request of Jewish leaders, the country's six largest TV networks agreed 
to broadcast "Night and Fog," a documentary about Nazi death camps, tonight. 
</P>
<P>
The coalition of Jewish groups organizing the procession asked that marchers 
display only authorized banners and posters with the slogan: "No to racism. No 
to anti-Semitism." 
</P>
<P>
Leaders of every major political party except the extreme-right National Front 
urged supporters to participate, as did human rights groups and many major 
labor unions. 
</P>
<P>
Police meanwhile appealed for witnesses to assist in their investigation of the 
desecration in Carpentras. Five skinheads were released after being questioned 
about the crime. 
</P>
<P>
The desecration there provoked outrage across France. 
</P>
<P>
In Haifa, Israel, over the weekend, about 300 graves were spray-painted with 
anti-Jewish slogans, and police said a Jew from a nearby town had been arrested 
as a suspect. Thousands of people went to the cemetery Sunday and relatives 
wept at the graves of their dead. 
</P>
<P>
Police sealed off the Carpentras cemetery today without explanation, and the 
widow of the man whose body was dug up reportedly left Carpentras after having 
received telephoned death threats. 
</P>
<P>
Interior Minister Pierre Joxe, along with other political and human rights 
leaders, has accused far-right politician Jean-Marie Le Pen of implicit 
responsibility in the desecration by creating an atmosphere of racial hatred. 
</P>
<P>
Le Pen, who said in an interview today the government was providing him with 
bodyguards, once termed the Nazi gas chambers "a detail" of history. His 
National Front favors the expulsion of Muslim immigrants from North Africa.
