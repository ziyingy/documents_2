Under the agreement, the World Wildlife Fund and the Nature Conservancy will 
buy from American Express Co. and Morgan Guaranty Trust Co. $9 million of 
Ecuador's debt at a discount of 11.875 cents on the dollar, putting the total 
cost to the group at $1.07 million.

The commercial bank debt will be converted, one-for-one, by the Ecuador Central 
Bank into local currency bonds that will be spent for conserving Ecuador's 
dwindling rain forests.

"Debt becomes not so much a burden as an opportunity to kill two birds with one 
stone -- debt and conservation," said Sen. Robert Kasten, a Wisconsin 
Republican who is co-sponsoring a bill that would expand debt-for-nature swaps.
