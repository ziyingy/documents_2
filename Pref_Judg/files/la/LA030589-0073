Drakes Bay is, beyond all reasonable doubt, the place on the California coast 
where Sir Francis Drake careened and repaired the Golden Hind in 1595 before 
setting sail for England and home, we learned the other day, reading the latest 
copy of the Smithsonian Institution Research Reports. The endless debate over 
the authenticity of the site is over. The early historians, who first proposed 
the location, have been proven correct. 
</P>
<P>
The report inspired us to talk with the two scholars who produced the last bit 
of evidence that clinched the case. They had sorted out the mystery through 
Ming Dynasty shards found among Coast Miwok tribe relics at the Point Reyes 
National Seashore that now embraces Drakes Bay.

It was Clarence F. Shangraw, chief curator of the Museum of Asian Art in San 
Francisco, who made the first spectacular discovery. He found that the 708 bits 
and pieces of what once had been 235 cups, bowls, plates and a vase were from 
two distinct periods of manufacture, some made in the mid 1570s, some made 20 
years later, in the mid-1590s. He was able to date each shard and specify where 
in China it had been made.

<P>
Then Edward P. Von der Porten, director of the Treasure Island Museum, made the 
second discovey: The older shards showed no signs of sea damage, even though 
they were finer and more delicate. But those made around 1595 had been worn in 
the way that pounding surf and sand smooth rough edges. "Two totally 
independent methods of analysis gave us identical answers," Von der Porten 
said. 
</P>
<P>
The answers, they reported, are clear: The older shards had to have been 
carried carefully ashore. They could only have come from Drake's ship. They had 
to be from the crates of precious Chinese ceramics logged aboard the Golden 
Hind when they were pirated by Drake from Spanish outposts and ships along the 
Central American Coast of the Pacific Ocean on the voyage before he reached 
Point Reyes. Records make clear that the crates were not aboard when the Golden 
Hind returned to England. As Drake consolidated his supplies for the long 
voyage home, he must reluctantly have lightened cargo and left the dishes for 
the Indians to use. 
</P>
<P>
The ceramics made a generation later must have been aboard the San Agustin, a 
Spanish trading vessel plying the Pacific between Acapulco and Manila. It had 
been blown far off course and then sank in a terrible storm at Drakes Bay on 
Nov. 30, 1595. Efforts to locate the wreckage, buried in centuries of 
accumulated sand, are now being planned. But detailed records of the shipwreck 
itself permit accurate dating. 
</P>
<P>
There was a lively but risky trade across the Pacific in those days, dominated 
by Spanish galleons running between the west coast of Mexico and the 
Philippines and Indonesia. Chinese ceramics were transferred in junks from 
points of manufacture to the trading ports, such as Manila. Galleons brought 
them to places like Acapulco. They were carted overland to Vera Cruz for 
shipment to Europe where extraordinary prices were paid, even for the 
lower-quality goods. Drake's booty included the finest products of Jingdezhen 
in south-central China, the center of fine ceramics from the 14th Century even 
to this day. But the San Agustin's cargo was of poorer-quality bowls and plates 
made on the south coast by entrepreneurs quick to respond to the lucrative 
market. 
</P>
<P>
The Miwok tribespeople apparently smashed most of the ceramics that came into 
their possession to make jewelry, even one elegant pendant, and to fashion 
effective tools for scraping hides. "Each culture finds a different use," 
Shangraw said philosophically. 
</P>
<P>
Some of the shards are now part of a traveling exhibition being shown in major 
museums, but Von der Porten hopes for a permanent exhibit in California one of 
these days. That will help him respond to the continuing skepticism that some 
still express about just where it was that Drake landed.
