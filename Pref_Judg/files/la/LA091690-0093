In surveying 50 years of political activity in the Chicano . . . or Mexican . . 
. or Mexican-American community -- this difficulty in labeling mirrors the 
society's complexity -- Juan Gomez-Quinonez unfolds a story of bigotry endured 
and aspirations thwarted. Despite such heady moments as the National Chicano 
Moratorium of 1970 and the success of the United Fruit Workers' grape boycott 
the same year, frustration is the enduring theme of this study. 
</P>
<P>
To the dominant society, a Mexican may be a Mexican may be a Mexican but, from 
within, Mexican America is diverse and contentious: "a complex social island in 
the midst of the United States," writes Gomez-Quinonez, a professor of history 
at UCLA and a one-time political activist, in this landmark study. Mexican 
America also is the fastest-growing ethnic community in the United States. 
</P>
<P>
The reality of a shared border and shared history have produced a binational 
culture that is churning but private, even mysterious, to outsiders. There are 
Americans of Mexican descent of all colors; there are those whose 
great-great-great-grandparents were born here and those who arrived this 
morning; there are Chicanos striving to overturn the Treaty of Guadalupe 
Hidalgo and others who simply want their fair chance at the American dream. 
</P>
<P>
Two passages, neither ostensibly political, nonetheless clarify the scope of 
Gomez-Quinonez's task in this chronological survey of Chicano political 
experience over the last 50 years. On the opening page, the author notes, "The 
terms Mexican(o), Mexican descent, Mexican American, Hispano and Chicano are 
used in an interchangeable way and also in distinct ways." It is difficult to 
clearly define this varied, often fragmented community. 
</P>
<P>
Gomez-Quinonez concludes his study with these lines: "What remains to be done 
is to recognize and deal with the heterogeneity within the Mexican community . 
. . Mexicans must come to terms with the political process and social reality, 
and then deal with them as they are." Illusions of homogeneity and idealized 
solutions must be rejected. 
</P>

While only a minority within the Chicano community has been politically active, 
that group has been busy indeed. In this book's pages, an astonishing list of a 
acronyms and abbreviations for political organizations flip by like fanned 
cards: PAPA, CIAA, CSO, LULAC, MAPA, PASSO, LRUP, MAYO; among many others, 
various schemes -- El Plan de Delano, Plan de la Raza Unida, Plan de Santa 
Barbara, etc -- are developed; gifted leaders emerge -- Dennis Chavez, Henry B. 
Gonzalez, Edward Roybal et al -- during the half-century surveyed by 
Gomez-Quinonez. Finally, though, "Minimum objectives have been pursued and 
minimum objects have been achieved." 
</P>
<P>
Why? "One reason is the lack of a center for a broadly distributed community. . 
. . There are no unifying overarching institutions. . . . There is no core set 
of beliefs or aims. . . ." Most of all, though, asserts the author, "the 
dominant society . . . determines what and who is politically legitimate 
vis-a-vis Mexicans and within the Mexican community" 
</P>
<P>
Places and people may differ -- northern New Mexico, with its small villages 
and long history of Mexican political involvement is radically different from 
the heated fields of south Texas or the crowded barrios of Los Angeles -- but 
all have suffered from misperceptions held by the dominant society, 
Gomez-Quinonez tells us, as well as from being taken for granted by the 
Democratic Party. 
</P>
<P>
Except for that recurrent theme of thwarted Chicano aspirations, the actual 
story that Gomez-Quinonez tells is too intricate and detailed to adequately 
summarize. High points begin with his coverage of World War II when "perhaps 
400,000 Mexican Americans served in the armed forces. Not one was charged with 
desertion or treason, and they suffered casualties above proportion of their 
numbers." 
</P>
<P>
Sharing that great effort with other kinds of Americans "led to a new optimism 
in the Mexican communities of the United States regarding the postwar period." 
What returning soldiers actually found was "rampant discrimination" that 
prompted the formation in 1948 of one of the most effective of early Chicano 
political groups, the GI Forum, whose national organizer was Molly Galvan, one 
of the first Chicanas to achieve political prominence. 
</P>
<P>
"The Forum utilized United States patriotic symbols and rhetoric," explains the 
UCLA historian, "and therefore occupied a secure position in its attempt to 
defend Mexican civil rights, representing a constituency with undeniable claims 
and demonstrable supportive needs." 
</P>
<P>
During the 1960s and '70s, the emergence of Cesar Chavez and the United Farm 
Workers was easily the most visible event in Mexican America, and its political 
implications are examined in this text. Less well known, however, were 
organizations such as CASA-HGT (Centro de Accion Social Autonoma-Hermandad 
General de Trabajadores), "the most salient progressive organization 
functioning in the Mexican community" during the '70s. In many ways CASA-HGT 
pointed toward the future, since it stressed "the development of national and 
class consciousness among activists" and recognized that "the possibility for 
radical social change in the United States is linked to an international 
process. . . ." 
</P>
<P>
The '80s were characterized by a paradoxical conservatism. Earlier radicalism 
in the Chicano community had "forced certain concessions from the Anglo 
mainstream . . . (and) created a setting from which a viable middle class 
emerged within the community." While the Reagan years also were a time of 
significant economic setbacks, "the community remains tempered by a uniquely 
Mexican concern for cultural continuity and political affirmation, while it is 
ambivalent as to how pluralistic the allegedly diverse system is." 
</P>
<P>
Unfortunately, this important book is neither compellingly organized nor 
crisply written. It is structured like a doctoral dissertation, opening with a 
turgid chapter on methodology and theory. The author is at his best in Chapter 
5, where he examines contemporary perspective. 
</P>
<P>
Nevertheless, "Chicano Politics" merits a reader's perseverance because it 
offers vital perspectives. If Gomez-Quinonez occasionally sounds like a 
frustrated radical in his scorn for the situation of Chicanos ("Mexicans in the 
United States do not have a state structure of their own") or the American 
system ("it advocates order because, simply put, order best serves so-called 
society"), he finally emerges as a pragmatist. 
</P>
<P>
Of idealized Chicano nationalism, he writes, "A rejection of the dominant 
society and a romanticized search for Mexican ties and bonds was an explainable 
process." Moreover, despite the heady demonstrations of the 1960s and '70s, he 
points out that "Neither white radical nor liberal groups have as yet served 
Mexicans well." And, with immigration and linked economies looming large, 
Gomez-Quinonez nonetheless points out "the limits of real understanding" 
between citizens of Mexico and Chicanos. 
</P>
<P>
This historian seems to have learned from hard experience the limits of 
idealism, and his thorough knowledge of the past makes his advice about the 
future compelling. With a growing population and cultural presence, 
commensurate political power for Mexican-Americans can be achieved, he 
suggests, only through "the continuing development of both single-membership 
advocacy and confrontational groups." 
</P>
<P>
Moreover, on a national as well as regional level, "Crucial to this development 
is the need for generalized national political consciousness, agreed-upon 
priorities, and principled leadership."
