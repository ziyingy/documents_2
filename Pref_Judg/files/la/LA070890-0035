Is it time to put the CD long box on the endangered species list? 
</P>
<P>
Maybe it's too early to predict the demise of the unpopular -- and unwieldy -- 
long box, which has become an industry-wide eco-embarrassment. But long-box 
opponents are on the offensive: 
</P>
<P>
* Saying he's received thousands of letters from outraged consumers, Ban the 
Box founder Robert Simonds, who runs Rykodisc Records, is touting a plan 
encouraging record buyers to remove long boxes and leave empty cartons with 
register clerks at local record stores. 
</P>
<P>
* The Ban the Box coalition has received "pledges of support" from dozens of 
new rock star partisans, including David Byrne, the B-52's, the Replacements' 
Paul Westerberg, 10,000 Maniacs, John Hiatt, Rosanne Cash, Crosby, Stills &amp; 
Nash and Lenny Kravitz. 
</P>
<P>
* Perhaps the most encouraging news is that long-box printer and paper 
manufacturers are feeling so much pressure that they've begun a lobbying 
counter-offensive. Worried that record labels are considering plans to junk the 
boxes, paper and printing companies have formed the Entertainment Packaging 
Assn. (EPA), which recently gave record execs a three-page fact sheet designed 
to promote the long box's positive attributes. 
</P>
<P>
(Among its claims, the fact sheet says that long boxes are "environmentally 
friendly"; that it is a "myth" that American forests are "being abused" like 
Brazilian rain forests and that eliminating CD packaging, which constitutes 
"less than .00006 of the weight of all garbage produced annually in the U.S.," 
would extend the life of a landfill "by less than one hour every year.") 
</P>
<P>
"We think the (long-box) has been unjustly maligned," says Floyd Glinert, EPA 
head and executive vice president of Shorewood Packaging, a leading New 
York-based paper-printing firm. 
</P>
<P>
"There's been a lot of overkill on this whole issue -- it's become almost 
unpatriotic to say you're not in favor of recycling. So after all the coverage 
during Earth Day, we felt that our side of the story wasn't being told. The 
bottom line is that long boxes represent an infinitesimal percentage of the 
solid-waste garbage in this country." 
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Tower Records chief Russ Solomon -- who in April dismissed 
environmental concerns, saying he was "adamantly opposed" to ditching the long 
box -- is changing his tune. While he still insists that long boxes are "the 
industry's most practical packaging tool," the owner of the influential 
55-store chain now boasts that clerks at Tower's L.A. and Seattle stores are 
encouraging consumers to leave long-box trash at the cash registers. 
</P>
<P>
"We've had a tremendous positive response," said the shift manager at Tower's 
Sunset Strip store. "We're unloading 40 to 50 20-gallon bags full of long boxes 
every day, which we're sending to a recycling center in Santa Monica. I'd say 
that nearly 75% of the customers are leaving their long boxes. And most people 
who don't are buying CDs as gifts." 
</P>
<P>
Tower stores will also soon offer consumers the choice between bags made out of 
recyclable plastic or paper. Is it possible Solomon has suddenly made the leap 
onto rock's eco-bandwagon? "I guess I'm more open-minded than I was a few 
months ago," he said. "We live in the real world and I listen to what people 
say -- and they're saying we have to be more ecology conscious. Even my own 
store clerks have been bitching at me and writing me nasty letters!" 
</P>
<P>
Ban the Box's Simonds is hoping his eco-offensive will encourage other record 
store owners to see the light. "It's a dramatic method for consumers to show 
retailers where they stand on CD packaging -- and transfer some of the 
consequences of the long box to record store owners," said Simonds, who began 
his campaign earlier this year. "It's also a way of reminding them that all 
this trash isn't out of sight and out of mind, because the trash is going into 
their dumpsters."
