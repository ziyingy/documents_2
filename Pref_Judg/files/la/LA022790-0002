It is not a great deal bigger than a dishwasher, an ordinary-looking box no 
more impressive than its own packing crate. It would fit nicely into an empty 
corner and make a good perch for a potted plant or -- in the old days -- an ash 
tray.

But looks are deceiving.

The unimpressive black cube, to be delivered to a government laboratory at 
Princeton University in two months, is in fact a new Cray YMP supercomputer. It 
can perform a billion mathematical computations in one second and solve 
millions of equations in mere minutes, tasks that used to take computers years. 
</P>
<P>
The trouble is, for the government laboratory that ordered it, even the Cray 
YMP is -- in a manner of speaking -- obsolete. Jerry D. Mahlman, director of 
the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration's Geophysical Fluid 
Dynamics Lab here, said: "We are already looking toward machines that will give 
us a trillion operations a second." 
</P>
<P>
What goes on here? What are Mahlman and his associates up to when the fastest 
new supercomputer is overwhelmed before it is uncrated? 
</P>
<P>
The answer is that Mahlman and hundreds of other climate experts in 
laboratories around the world are engaged in one of the most enormous and 
complicated tasks scientists have ever attempted. 
</P>
<P>
JK They are trying to determine if Earth is becoming dangerously warm.

Many scientists fear that man-made carbon dioxide and methane are accumulating 
in the atmosphere and, like the glass walls of a greenhouse, trapping heat near 
the ground. It is a concern that has transformed weather forecasting from an 
obscure combination of art and science into a growth industry. 
</P>
<P>
Preliminary reports to the United Nations' Intergovernmental Panel on Climate 
Change, which recently met for three days in Washington, indicated a growing 
consensus that Earth's temperature will rise 1.5 degrees to 4.5 degrees 
centigrade by the middle of the next century unless steps are taken to reduce 
such "greenhouse gas" emissions. 
</P>
<P>
The potential repercussions of overall warming -- rising ocean levels as the 
polar ice caps melt and a northward shifting of the Northern Hemisphere's prime 
agricultural zone -- are subjects of furious debate and international decisions 
of a complexity never before undertaken. 
</P>
<P>
"Maybe, a decade from now, we will be able to say whether continental dryness, 
such as we experienced in the summer of 1988, will be very probable in the 
future," Mahlman said. "Or maybe we will have found that is not the case at 
all." 
</P>
<P>
To determine whether, when and how much the Pacific Ocean will rise at Santa 
Monica and whether the farming conditions of the Corn Belt will move up to 
North Dakota, scientists must: 
</P>
<P>
 -- Learn from the past. To predict the future, meteorologists must understand 
what has come before. They are studying everything from Antarctic ice cores to 
tax records from ancient Egypt. 
</P>
<P>
 -- Understand clouds. Perhaps more than any other variable, they affect 
Earth's temperature. 
</P>
<P>
 -- Study the oceans. They moderate temperature swings -- potentially good news 
to the Southern Hemisphere. 
</P>
<P>
Mahlman's laboratory on the Princeton campus is one of eight centers -- four 
are in the United States -- that are trying to unravel these mysteries. They 
are on the cutting edge of an unprecedented scientific enterprise: creating 
three-dimensional mathematical grids around the planet in an effort to 
understand how the oceans and the atmosphere will respond to a continued 
outpouring of carbon dioxide and methane. 
</P>
<P>
Based on current models, Mahlman has put the major potential effects of 
doubling the amount of atmospheric carbon dioxide into the four categories -- 
possible, probable, very probable and nearly certain. 
</P>
<P>
He considers global warming, increased precipitation worldwide, a warming of 
the northern polar region and a reduction of sea ice all very probable -- a 
likelihood greater than 90%. In the probable, or 80%, category, he places 
increased precipitation in the Northern Hemisphere, drought in North America 
and a rise in the average sea level. In the uncertain category he places 
regional changes in vegetation cover and more tropical storms. Learning from 
the Past Computer technology is not all that limits these scientists' ability 
to forecast the so-called greenhouse effect. There are vast gaps in the raw 
information that must go into the global models. International science is not 
only collecting contemporary data on an unprecedented scale, from the ocean 
depths to the outer limits of the atmosphere, it is also trying to reconstruct 
the ebb, flow and pulsation of climate over the last 160,000 years. What they 
have accomplished is the scientific equivalent of ingenious detective work. 
Joseph Fletcher, now director of NOAA's Environmental Research Laboratories, 
found priceless historic readings of ocean temperatures in British Admiralty 
records. He spent years compiling temperature readings, scrupulously taken by 
sea captains at their boilers' intakes, and produced a landmark collection of 
evidence for oceanographers and modelers. Equally imaginative sleuths have 
found fish harvest records in Peruvian monasteries that can be used to infer 
fluctuations in ocean temperatures. Others have examined fossils, studied core 
samples from trees, combed Egyptian tax records for clues to flooding in the 
Nile Valley and analyzed pollen left behind by ancient forests. For more recent 
evidence in the United States, the search has taken scientists into county and 
state archives for records of water levels in aquifers and wells during 
extended droughts. They have also gleaned information from records of debates 
over Colorado River water rights. "We just must have a better record of the 
last 1,000 years, and a very much better record of the last 200," said John 
Eddy, director of interdisciplinary Earth studies at the University Corp. for 
Atmospheric Research. So far, climate history's nearest approximation of a 
Rosetta Stone is a 2,000-meter ice core extracted during the 1950s from the 
Antarctic region near the Soviet Union's Vostok Station. Because it contains 
bubbles of air trapped as long as 160,000 years ago and across the intervening 
ice ages, the Vostok core has enabled scientists to establish a link between 
carbon dioxide and methane levels and surface temperature. This stark, frozen 
record shows that carbon dioxide content increased from 180 parts per million 
during the last great Ice Age (about 160,000 years ago) to 280 p.p.m. before 
the Industrial Revolution in the 18th Century. That level has reached some 350 
p.p.m. and is rising at a rate of about 0.4% a year. Other core samples have 
been taken from the Himalayas in Tibet, from the Peruvian Andes and the ocean 
floor. Cores taken in the mountains of Tibet by Lonnie Thompson of the 
University of Ohio'Clouds and Oceans The data gaps that truly bedevil the model 
makers, however, are not the vagaries of climate history but a lack of the 
information needed to fathom climatic feedback processes and the contributions 
of oceans and clouds to cooling and warming processes. The No. 1 priority, 
scientists generally agree, is to learn more about clouds. This is where the 
scarcity of information is most profound. The broader questions begging to be 
answered, said Gordon J. MacDonald, a former chairman of the U.S. Council on 
Environmental Quality who began studying global warming nearly 20 years ago, 
concern the balance of cloud types and the effect of climate warming on their 
formation and distribution. Although it is established that clouds have an 
overall cooling effect by reflecting sunlight, they have not become a part of 
global climate models. Because so many clouds of all types are so small and so 
widely scattered, scientists have yet to put together a coherent picture of 
their formation, their characteristics and their dissipation. There is vast 
ignorance about the reflectivity of small clouds, the processes that go on 
inside them and their local effect. "We are just beginning to understand the 
physical processes and the relevance of the altitudes and types," said Guy 
Brasseur, an atmospheric chemist at the National Center for Atmospheric 
Research. The role of the oceans is somewhat better understood, although 
information is also limited. "Sea surface data on a global scale is very 
spotty," said Robert W. Correll, vice chairman of the Committee on Earth 
Sciences, which coordinates U.S. global change research. "There are many areas 
of the world where we have no data at all. Zilch." The most sophisticated ocean 
modeling is done at the Geophysical Fluid Dynamics Lab, where scientists have 
been at it for 20 years. In a study there last year, Syukuro Manabe and his 
colleagues linked an ocean model with an atmospheric model and projected carbon 
dioxide buildup at a rate of 1% a year for the next 200 years. The experiment 
predicted a dramatic warming of the Northern Hemisphere. In the test case, the 
Southern Hemisphere, particularly in the southernmost latitudes, stubbornly 
resisted warming. The conclusion was that the much larger expanses of oceans 
below the Equator kept the atmosphere from heating up. "Down in the region of 
the Antarctic," Mahlman said, "there is an upwelling, a mixing, bringing up old 
water that hasn't seen the surface in perhaps 500 years, water that you might 
say hasn't had time to be warmed by the greenhouse effect. The temperature of 
the air is determined by the temperature of the water. This is a stunner, 
because it says that the ocean contributes strongly to the distribution of 
climate change." The dearth of crucial data on clouds and oceans may persist 
for years. Many modelers scoffed when the George C. Marshall Institute 
concluded last year that increased investment in supercomputers could pay off 
in firm scientific evidence to back up policy decisions in as little time as 
three years. The report was controversial in another respect as well: It 
concluded that current forecasts are not accurate enough to form bases for 
policy decisions. That conclusion was said to have made a deep impression on 
White House Chief of Staff John H. Sununu, one of the principal makers of 
environmental policy in the George Bush Administration. It was heatedly 
challenged by environmentalists, who feared it would provide an excuse for 
delaying needed action. In that debate, scientists, for the most part, remain 
on the sideline. Many of them counsel against trying to overwhelm the problem 
with massive infusions of money. "ted, we are data-limited and we are 
talent-limited," Mahlman said, "but I have made myself unpopular with people 
who want to throw money at the climate problem. If somebody told me they wanted 
to double the (Geophysical Fluid Dynamics Lab) budget next year, I would say 
no." The overall effort to produce reliable models will be massively expensive 
nevertheless. The cost of collecting the crucial ocean and cloud data will 
dwarf the outlays for computers and modeling laboratories. The Bush 
Administration's proposed budget would invest half of a $2-billion increase in 
environmental funds programs in global warming research. Yet $1.03 billion is 
barely the tip of the iceberg. Estimates are that development and 15 years of 
operation of the National Aeronautics and Space Administration's Earth 
Observation System will cost $32 billion. Except for the manned exploration of 
the moon, it would be the most expensive program in the agency's history. Earth 
Observation System instruments will provide scientists with the precise kinds 
of information they need to build the high-resolution models that will begin to 
make regional climate projections feasible. They are expected to supply global 
cloud counts, measure their altitudes and identify them by type. They will be 
able to observe clouds as small as 0.25 kilometer in diameter, compared to the 
25-kilometer limit of today's satellites. But the first Earth Observation 
System platform is not due to be launched until 1997. In the meantime, exciting 
new data on the ocean is expected to come from a U.S. TOPEX satellite to be 
launched by the French. The satellite, scheduled to begin operation in 1992, 
will carry an advanced altimeter to measure the height of the ocean surface 
within about 2 centimeters. This information perhaps will shed light on 
questions such as how water carried north in the Gulf Stream flows back to the 
Equator. Climate-modeling centers and satellite operators also face problems in 
managing their archives. In the basement of the Geophysical Fluid Dynamics Lab, 
30,000 tapes are stored. In the archives of the National Center for Atmospheric 
Research at Table Mesa, near Boulder, Colo., the tape file now runs to 75,000 
numbers. The massive accumulation of data is only a hint of things to come. One 
Earth Observation System platform will produce 10 trillion bytes of data daily. 
The plan is to have two of them in orbit at a time for 15 years. Only by 
compiling more and more data can scientists hope to achieve the necessary 
precision in their climatological models. The coarse grids now in use have data 
points that are about 500 kilometers apart. "If we are to understand more 
specifically the regional responses to climate change, then we must have higher 
resolution," said Guy Brasseur of the National Center for Atmospheric Research. 
"When we reduce the distance between grid points by a factor of two, our 
requirement for computer power increases by a factor of 10. We think the 
prediction of regional response requires a resolution of 50 to 100 kilometers, 
so we need two or three new generations of computers." Equally important to 
some scientists is understanding what the models are saying. Mahlman recently 
tried to run a high-resolution model on the old computer at the Geophysical 
Fluid Dynamics Lab, the one that is to be replaced with the new Cray YMP. "I 
have been able to run it, but I can't make sense of it," he said. "The weakest 
link in all of this may be the inability to get at the numbers. It's not enough 
just to crunch the numbers, you have to know what they mean."
