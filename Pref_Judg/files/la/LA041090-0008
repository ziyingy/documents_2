I was the eldest of four children. By the time I was 7, my parents' divorce was 
finalized. To prevent my father's visits, my mother packed us all up and left 
the state. 
</P>
<P>
At first, her abuse was mostly mental. She took great pains to ostracize me 
from the family. I never understood why I was singled out, and I was afraid to 
ask. The physical abuse began when I was 10. In the beginning, it was only 
three or four times a week that she would beat me. After the beatings, she 
would run hot water in the bathtub, add salt and force me to sit in it while I 
was still bleeding. 
</P>
<P>
As the months went by, the beating and torturing turned into a work of art for 
her. She tried several things, including thorny rose branches, a fishing pole, 
a bamboo broom before settling on a white electrical extension cord, which soon 
became red with my blood. By that time, the beatings were daily. I was 11. 
</P>

My mother always quoted the Bible, "Spare the rod and spoil the child." She 
began starving me and locking me in the closet, alone with only my thoughts and 
imagination. I would dream of killing her. 
</P>
<P>
At the age of 13, while preparing a composition for school, I came across a 
book on state law with a section on child abuse. I told my school counselors 
that I was being abused. I was then removed from my home and placed in an 
emergency foster home. 
</P>
<P>
Up to then, I didn't know how close to death I was. I weighed 70 pounds; my 
height was only 4 foot 10; my skin tone was no longer brown but gray and 
yellow. 
</P>
<P>
Living with a foster mother was a difficult transition. I was extremely 
introverted, and my outlook on life was very negative. I would always expect 
the worst; that way, I'd never be disappointed. 
</P>
<P>
My foster mother stressed that independence and hard work would get what you 
needed from life. By the time I was 15, I was planning my "emancipation" at 18 
and saving money. It was a problem, because I was allowed to have only $999. 
</P>
<P>
Before I left, I received a phone call telling me about the availability of 
food stamps or government assistance. I hated that. My plans were to make it on 
my own without help of any kind. Twelve years later, I'm happy to say I've been 
successful at that.
