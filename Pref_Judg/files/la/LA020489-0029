The driver of a tractor-trailer that ran off the Hollywood Freeway and struck 
two houses turned himself in to authorities Friday, three days after the 
accident.

California Highway Patrol Officer Jim Young said Reginald Davis, 31, of 
Hawthorne, who is under investigation for leaving the scene of an accident and 
driving with a suspended license, was not arrested and was released after he 
gave a statement about the accident.

The CHP also said that he was not the driver listed on the truck's documents 
and that the company did not check the status of his license, according to 
Officer Jeff Harman. 
</P>
<P>
Peggy Caley, president of J. Cal Transportation, which owns the truck, said the 
Lakewood company did not have time to check Davis' record with the state 
Department of Motor Vehicles because he was hired at the last minute over the 
weekend when the regular driver got sick. 
</P>

Davis told authorities that a car hit the truck before the Tuesday night 
accident, causing him to lose control of the vehicle. However, officers who 
were at the accident believe Davis hit an abandoned car parked on the shoulder.

"He said he was dazed and confused and wandered off from the crash and that he 
woke up two days later lying in the bushes adjacent to the freeway," Young 
said. 
</P>
<P>
Davis asked a resident of one of the Babcock Avenue houses that had been hit to 
call 911, then disappeared. 
</P>
<P>
Young said the CHP will ask the Los Angeles city attorney's office to file two 
misdemeanor charges against Davis for leaving the scene of an accident and for 
driving without a license. 
</P>
<P>
The DMV reported that Davis had his license suspended in October for driving 
under the influence of alcohol or drugs and that he was holding a chauffeur's 
license, not the truck driver's license required to drive an 18-wheeler.
