Supporters of the Los Angeles City Council's ethics-and-pay-raise package 
failed Thursday in a behind-the-scenes attempt to gain control of the writing 
of the opposition argument that is to be placed on the June ballot along with 
the proposal. 
</P>
<P>
The maneuver prompted a bitter complaint from Councilman Zev Yaroslavsky, a foe 
of the package, who said its proponents were trying to sabotage the opposition 
"with rank, gutter political maneuvering." 
</P>
<P>
Yaroslavsky told reporters that a council member who opposed the package ought 
to write the opposition argument. Instead, backers of the package had enlisted 
Councilman Gilbert Lindsay, who voted for it, to nominate himself to write the 
opposition language, Yaroslavsky said. 
</P>
<P>
The maneuver was abandoned Thursday when Council President John Ferraro 
selected Councilwoman Ruth Galanter, an opponent of the package, to draw up the 
opposition statement. 
</P>
<P>
According to a source involved in the matter, it was Ferraro who had asked 
Lindsay's staff to write a letter requesting that Lindsay be appointed for the 
task. 
</P>
<P>
Bob Gay, Lindsay's chief deputy, confirmed Thursday that he had been asked by 
another council member to write the letter. Gay declined to say who made the 
request. 
</P>
<P>
Lindsay, 89, has suffered a stroke, is in poor health and is not up to the 
task, Yaroslavsky said. Had Lindsay gotten the assignment, the outcome would 
have been a weak opposition argument controlled by supporters of the package. 
</P>
<P>
The measure approved Wednesday would establish public financing of political 
campaigns, ban outside jobs and honorariums for elected officials, restrict 
gifts they may receive and bar them from lobbying for one year after they leave 
office. 
</P>
<P>
The ballot statements, 300- to 500-word explanations, are "pivotal" and will be 
the opponents' "only vehicle to communicate with the voters," said Yaroslavsky, 
who voted against the package Wednesday along with Councilman Ernani Bernardi. 
Galanter did not vote. 
</P>
<P>
Yaroslavsky called the tactic "unethical" and said backers of the package 
attempted it "out of fear that a coherent argument would be written against 
this Charter amendment." 
</P>
<P>
"People who are duly qualified and have opposed the measure out of conviction 
and not out of manipulation should have the opportunity to write that 
argument," Yaroslavsky said. 
</P>
<P>
"Mr. Lindsay in all likelihood would not have been capable of writing an 
argument in the time allotted." 
</P>
<P>
Ferraro denied any role in the matter and said all he knew was that he had 
received a letter signed by Lindsay requesting that he be permitted to write 
the opposition statement. 
</P>
<P>
Yaroslavsky said: "It's a sad situation and it's having an impact on public 
policy. . . . Gil has been physically incapacitated since his stroke. He is not 
the same Gil he was before." 
</P>
<P>
In an interview Thursday, Lindsay said he did not want to write the opposition 
statement. When asked about the letter that Ferraro had received from him, 
Lindsay responded, "I guess I changed my mind." 
</P>
<P>
Told of Yaroslavsky's comments about his health, Lindsay said: "How would he 
know what my capabilities are? I've been doing pretty well all these years." 
Lindsay has served on the council for 27 years.
