Some designers took a giant leap into the past when they showed their fall and 
winter menswear to press and buyers here earlier this month. 
</P>
<P>
Frock coats reminiscent of those worn by Edwardian dandies looked even dandier 
when shown with knee breeches and ruffled jabot shirts. Brocade vests and 
crushed-velvet trousers added to the time-warp effect. 
</P>
<P>
Strong endorsers of this remembrance of things past were London's Katharine 
Hamnett and Paris' Jean Paul Gaultier, who added to the fun by having all his 
models wear "Lone Ranger" face masks and Dali-esque waxed mustaches. 
</P>
<P>
Both designers, however, frequently anticipate worldwide trends before they 
happen. And if they feel there's a frock coat in your future, maybe there is. 
</P>
<P>
For several seasons now, these French menswear showings have been growing in 
importance. There were more than 30 runway presentations this time around, and 
audiences are larger than before. American retailers who traipsed all over town 
to catch the action included contingents from I. Magnin, Macy's California, 
Bloomingdale's, Barney's and Charivari in New York and a big group from 
Marshall Field in Chicago, which will start a four-month French promotion in 
September. 
</P>
<P>
Hamnett made her impact with a small collection. Gaultier kept his audience 
entertained for more than an hour with an extravaganza of ideas: a zip-front, 
checked shirt worn with a checked suit, a version of the Chairman Mao jacket 
over Charlie Chaplin baggy pants, jackets detailed to look as if they're 
inside-out and sophisticated camel overcoats with underarm slits for a 
cape-like effect. 
</P>
<P>
Gaultier's classic, six-button jacket is cut slightly longer and easier for 
next fall, to balance the very narrow stirrup pants tucked into brown leather 
shoes, which looked to have built-in bunions. When that narrow pants shape 
didn't have stirrup straps, it had the update that was seen in every menswear 
collection: cuffs at least 6 inches deep. 
</P>
<P>
Gaultier's colors are usually his favorite murky browns, purples and spinach 
greens, but this time there were explosions of bright orange and red for 
cropped blouson jackets or drawstring-waist parkas, while several of those 
frock coats took on an extra dimension when cut in sunflower yellow or Pacific 
blue. 
</P>
<P>
Bowler hats, fringed silk and wool scarfs bowed high on the neck, those face 
masks and mustaches were the Gaultier accessories. 
</P>
<P>
If Gaultier dazzled with his ingenuity, Claude Montana dazzled with his 
perfectionist approach. As he has been doing for several seasons, Montana 
continues to avoid the tough-edged aggressiveness that once characterized his 
clothes. 
</P>
<P>
For winter, everything looked supple, soft, easy and comfortable. Shown his 
way, in muted shades of gray layered from the shirt out to the coat, or in a 
navy and eggplant palette, this was still very much a collection for the 
faithful follower. The individual pieces, however, were such that even the most 
conservative dresser could find lots to buy here, starting with the marvelous 
Montana greatcoats and continuing to his adaptations of classic one-, three- or 
double-buttoned suit jackets. 
</P>
<P>
Pants silhouettes were either loose and pleated, breaking on suede laced shoes, 
or narrow shapes with that deep cuff previously mentioned. 
</P>
<P>
Suedes and leathers, usually important here, were less so this season. 
Montana's pumpkin suede blouson added color to a monochromatic color story. He 
also had a version of the Mao -- or could it be an early Beatles -- suit: the 
mid-thigh jacket buttoned to the neck and was worn over narrow pants. 
</P>
<P>
Nino Cerruti sometimes lets his young design assistants try their hands at 
menswear. But before this show, he said: "I wanted to do it all myself; my way 
with comfort and ease." 
</P>
<P>
There were signature touches, such as deep cuffs and Cerruti's sportier version 
of the Mao suit (his looked more like a Chinese worker's outfit), but done 
simply and with elegance. 
</P>
<P>
As at Montana, almost all his suit looks were shown tie-less. The few ties 
Cerruti did show were the tie news of the season: wide and soft. 
</P>
<P>
Cerruti called the evening portion of his show "cocooning," and instead of 
sending out traditional black-tie looks, sent out the models in faded tartan 
dressing gowns edged in blanket fringe or at-home velvet smoking jackets on 
tartan stay-at-home trousers. 
</P>
<P>
Thierry Mugler has his own strong menswear look, but even he seemed to be 
softening up for fall/winter. Colors like violet and lime took some of the 
sternness out of those Mugler uniforms: collarless jackets snapped shut at the 
waist over narrow pants. Here too, the collarless coat was great looking in a 
murky brown. 
</P>
<P>
Yohji Yamamoto and Rei Kawakubo at Comme des Garcons seemed in a more relaxed 
mood. But both collections, with their navy jackets tipped or piped in white 
and shown with white corduroy pants, looked more summer than winter. 
</P>
<P>
Yamamoto's approach was more straightforward than it has ever been, with the 
proportions of jackets, sweaters and trousers well within norms acceptable to 
most men. 
</P>
<P>
In a more extravagant mood were Marithe and Francois Girbaud, where pant shapes 
ranged from knickers to jodhpurs to knee breeches. Some jackets, in this 
bicentenary year of the French Revolution, looked pure Napoleon. 
</P>
<P>
They, as well as London's Paul Smith and Nikos Apostolopoulos, were big fans of 
velvet fabric, using it in everything from vests to jackets and trousers. 
</P>
<P>
Smith's best looks were his dark-background, printed velvet floral shirts and 
vests, which were worn with pinwale cords. 
</P>
<P>
Nikos, who made his reputation with sexy men's underwear, now does an entire 
collection ranging from Count Dracula capes to Flash Gordon silver motorcycle 
jackets. The more commercial items included layered blousons, the underneath 
one in denim, the top one in brushed wool.
