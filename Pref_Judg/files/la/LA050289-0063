A Kern County waste disposal firm was fined $150,000 by state Health Director 
Ken Kizer and ordered to correct alleged toxic pollution violations at its 
Buttonwillow facilities. Department of Health Services inspectors said 
Petroleum Waste Inc. failed to implement a required emergency contingency plan 
following the exposure of three employees to hazardous wastes, failed to submit 
a written report on the incident to the state and inspectors noted what they 
called poor laboratory management practices. Kizer said most violations have 
been corrected.
