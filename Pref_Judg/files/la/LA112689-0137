They have survived war, prison, famine, terrifying voyages across 
pirate-infested seas and long stints in refugee camps. Now, in the land of 
their dreams, thousands of Vietnamese immigrants spend long days hunched over 
sewing machines in sweatshops in suburban Orange County. 
</P>
<P>
Some earn as little as $1 an hour. Most are glad to get it. 
</P>
<P>
Beside them toil Latino immigrants who have fled impoverished homelands for 
prosperous Southern California, only to land Third World-style jobs here. 
</P>
<P>
At least 400 sewing shops have sprung up in and around Orange County's Little 
Saigon, employing upward of 5,000 immigrants. In fact, the majority of the shop 
owners are themselves former boat people who have been in this country less 
than five years. 
</P>
<P>
These suburban sweatshops are tucked into clean new industrial buildings, just 
out of sight of their affluent neighbors, and out of mind of the consumers who 
buy their products in some of the nation's priciest department stores. Seeing 
"Made in USA" labels, most shoppers are utterly unaware that some of these 
garments have been made by immigrants and refugees -- sometimes children -- 
working long hours for a fraction of the minimum wage. 
</P>
<P>
It's not just money but a certain resignation to hardship that keeps these 
immigrants at their sewing machines. Ngoc Pha Nguyen, 46, has worked at several 
sewing shops that cheated and underpaid her. Now she earns $4.25 an hour, the 
California minimum wage. She is deeply grateful. 
</P>
<P>
It took Nguyen four attempts to escape from Vietnam. Two of her daughters and 
14 other family members didn't make it. "I'm very sad, so when I get to work, I 
forget about it for a while," she said through an interpreter. "If I stay home, 
I look at the family shrine and cry." 
</P>
<P>
Nguyen bends over to stitch the flounces on party dresses -- a tedious task 
performed over and over under hot lights in a crowded, airless garage. The 
truth is, she hates to sew. But, she says, she can't find a better job. 
</P>
<P>
The shop where Nguyen works is paid $6.75 for each dress she stitches. 
Identical dresses with the same labels were selling at a South Coast Plaza 
department store for $64 each. 
</P>
<P>
"The people who are really making the big money are the retailers and the 
financiers of the retailers, and some of the manufacturers," said Edna 
Bonacich, a UC Riverside sociology professor studying Asians in the California 
garment industry. "The workers are totally exploited." 
</P>
<P>
Once a backwater in the $6-billion-a-year Los Angeles-area garment industry, 
Orange County now produces everything from junior knits to inexpensive evening 
wear. But it is a transformation that comes with a price tag of its own. 
</P>
<P>
Authorities warn that these new suburban sweatshop workers -- particularly in 
Orange County but also in immigrant strongholds throughout Southern California 
-- are becoming the latest victims of an industry that has been nourished by 
cheap immigrant labor for nearly a century. 
</P>
<P>
Far from the downtown Los Angeles garment district, where enforcement officials 
know the turf, offenders are hard to catch. And federal and state labor 
officials say that when they do find them, enforcement is often stymied by the 
same dynamics that have kept sweatshops in business for more than a century. 
Owners insist they'll go bankrupt if they pay the minimum wage. Workers won't 
complain no matter how bad their treatment because they are undocumented 
aliens, are receiving public assistance or are simply afraid. And manufacturers 
have few incentives to investigate the conditions under which their products 
are made. 
</P>
<P>
Suburban Sweatshops 
</P>
<P>
From the outside, Orange County sweatshops bear little resemblance to the ones 
found in dilapidated buildings in teeming garment districts in downtown Los 
Angeles, San Francisco and New York. 
</P>
<P>
Most are in brand-new complexes of light-industrial buildings that tend to be 
located just behind the restaurants and mini-malls that line the thoroughfares 
connecting Garden Grove, Westminster and Santa Ana, where about 100,000 
Vietnamese-Americans have settled since 1975. 
</P>
<P>
"Sweatshops flourish wherever you have pockets of immigrants," said Allen J. 
Scott, professor of urban and economic geography at UCLA. "It's not just 
happening in Orange County, it's happening in the San Fernando Valley and in 
Long Beach. . . . And there's a big new Korean community growing up around Van 
Nuys. 
</P>
<P>
"What has been happening recently is a decentralization in all directions out 
from the garment district, not only to tap . . immigrant populations but also 
to take advantage of the cheaper land," Scott said. 
</P>
<P>
In 1983, Scott studied garment subcontractors and found that nearly all were 
located in downtown Los Angeles. He found only two in Orange County. Last 
spring, Bonacich analyzed the ethnic makeup of the state's 4,589 registered 
garment contractors and found 172 in Orange County. 
</P>
<P>
The owners of 102 of them were Vietnamese. One was Chinese, 11 Latino and 10 
Korean; 24 were owned by other Asians whose national origin was unclear, and 
the rest were unknown. 
</P>
<P>
Including the 20% to 30% of shops that are unregistered and the scores of 
mini-sweatshops hidden inside single-family homes and garages, Bonacich 
estimates Orange County now has at least 400 sewing shops. 
</P>
<P>
"We haven't run into a single Vietnamese who's been in business here for more 
than two years, so this seems like a brand-new business for Orange County," 
said Rolene Otero, director of enforcement for the U.S. Department of Labor's 
Wage and Hour Division in Santa Ana. "In the last two years, it's just 
exploded." 
</P>
<P>
But while wages and working conditions in Los Angeles have on the whole 
improved thanks to heavy enforcement, officials said, labor abuses in Orange 
County are widespread. 
</P>
<P>
A recent crackdown spearheaded by Otero found 18 Orange County sweatshops that 
had been violating minimum wage, overtime and child labor laws -- including the 
shop that employed Ngoc Pha Nguyen, according to documents obtained by the Los 
Angeles Times under the Freedom of Information Act. So far, the shops have been 
ordered to repay more than $180,000 to at least 220 workers, and some cases are 
still pending, Otero said. 
</P>
<P>
"The extremely low wages across the board in Orange County are not the case in 
Los Angeles," Otero said. "In L.A. you will find $10-an-hour employees. In 
Orange County, we have yet to find a single employee paid any more than the 
minimum wage." 
</P>
<P>
The suburbanization of sweatshops is an outgrowth of the changes that are 
reshaping the garment industry, scholars and officials said. First, foreign 
competition has driven down prices in the domestic sewing industry. But at the 
same time, manufacturers need flexible production capability because rush 
orders for more of a hot-selling item cannot be filled fast enough overseas. 
</P>
<P>
The solution -- especially in inexpensive clothing, women's and junior wear, 
where fashions change overnight and quality is often second to price and timing 
-- is to subcontract the sewing. This enables manufacturers quickly to shift 
their designs and output to ride out the treacherous market tides -- while 
largely escaping legal responsibility for any labor abuses committed by the 
companies that sew for them, officials and garment-industry sources said. 
</P>
<P>
"They've created a Third World labor force here to match the Third World labor 
force with which they're competing abroad," Bonacich said. 
</P>
<P>
"We all need work, and we take anything we can get," said one Vietnamese shop 
owner, who said she cannot possibly pay her workers the minimum wage because 
the price she gets for finished garments is so low. 
</P>
<P>
Labor Police 
</P>
<P>
Some argue that labor police have never succeeded in crushing sweatshops in the 
past and are unlikely to do so now because the market demands them. 
</P>
<P>
"If you really tried to enforce immigration and other laws about working 
conditions, in both the garment industry and the electronics industry in 
Southern California, the effect on the economy would be disastrous," Scott 
said. "So the enforcement is symbolic more than it is systematic." 
</P>
<P>
In a typical suburban sweatshop, fluorescent lights beat down on rows of sewing 
machines. Heaps of pre-cut fabric spill out of plastic bags onto cement floors 
littered with scraps of cloth, threads and cigarette butts. Remnants of meals 
linger in odd corners, and the air smells sour. 
</P>
<P>
In many shops owned by Asians, the office decor includes a red-and-gold 
lacquered shrine with an incense holder and a porcelain statue of Than Tai, the 
Vietnamese god of money. Perhaps no less symbolic are the time clocks and 
posters nearby that detail, in English, the California minimum wage and 
overtime laws. They pacify the authorities, but few of the workers can read, 
write or speak English. And the time cards are rarely used to determine wages, 
because most workers are paid by the piece. 
</P>
<P>
Labor abuses exist in part because both shop owners and the workers themselves 
are participants in a vast underground economy. Authorities say the sweatshops 
prey on two particularly vulnerable groups: illegal Latino aliens and Southeast 
Asian refugees who work illegally and collect welfare at the same time. 
</P>
<P>
"My former boss used to pay us 10 cents a piece for ironing," said Maria del 
Pilar Solano, 23, a sweatshop worker who has since applied for immigration 
amnesty and is not receiving public assistance. "We would work from 7 a.m. to 8 
p.m. We got $8 or $9 a day, sometimes $4 or $5. At the end of the week we would 
add it up and we would get only $50 a week. The owner used to say it was a lot 
of money." 
</P>
<P>
And to Solano, it was a lot of money. In Mexico, where she worked as a knitter, 
she earned $12 every two weeks. 
</P>
<P>
Federal inspectors raided the shop where Solano worked and found that it had 
been paying less than the minimum wage and had illegally employed 12 home 
workers, federal documents show. The garments Solano and her colleagues made 
were sold to Macy's and Bloomingdale's department stores, documents show. 
Solano said the shop has since changed hands and is now paying $4.25 an hour. 
Even some of the immigrants who have working papers accept between $1 and $3 an 
hour because they have no skills, speak no English and are often desperate to 
earn money to send home, authorities and Vietnamese community leaders said. 
</P>
<P>
"In Vietnam for $10, one person can live for a month," said Ly (Louis) Cao of 
Vietnamese Community of Orange County Inc. in Santa Ana, which provides 
retraining for scores of refugees who are in the garment industry but want 
better jobs. "Ninety-nine percent send money home." 
</P>
<P>
Some also are willing to stay in the sweatshops or stitch at home in secret for 
a fraction of the minimum wage because they are collecting welfare, housing 
subsidies or food stamps, authorities said. 
</P>
<P>
In the world of sweatshops, where wages are paid in cash, and records, where 
they exist, are sketchy, it is tricky to identify the true victims, authorities 
say. 
</P>
<P>
The proprietor of one floundering shop in the Euclid Business Center in Garden 
Grove, $3,000 behind on his rent, stunned his landlord by coming in to pay the 
entire sum in $5 bills. And state welfare fraud inspectors tell of refugees 
who, by putting every family member to work, continuing to collect benefits, 
living three families to a house, and scrimping for years, have managed to buy 
$200,000 homes or businesses of their own -- again, all purchased in cash. 
</P>
<P>
Beds and Bassinets 
</P>
<P>
Even deeper in the shadows are the uncounted workers who assemble garments 
illegally in their homes. 
</P>
<P>
Officials will not even guess at how many there are, but the practice of home 
sewing both by families and by sweatshop workers who take work home with them 
after hours is certainly widespread. Nine of the 18 sweatshops cited by Otero 
were employing such illegal home workers. 
</P>
<P>
Danny Lam, who runs a sewing machine shop in Garden Grove, estimates that he 
sells about 20 industrial machines a month to Vietnamese, Cambodian, Laotian, 
Korean and Mexican families who tell him they plan to sew at home. And Lam has 
three competitors in Orange County alone. 
</P>
<P>
The first authorities to notice the burgeoning home sewing industry were Orange 
County welfare fraud inspectors sent to check out tips that some of the 
county's 22,000 refugees who receive public assistance were working on the sly. 
</P>
<P>
"When we go to (their) houses to do welfare fraud investigations, 70% to 80% of 
the time we find sewing machines," said Van Nguyen, a welfare fraud 
investigator for the Orange County district attorney's office. 
</P>
<P>
State Deputy Labor Commissioner Craig Cubberly began accompanying Nguyen and 
her partner on their monthly rounds to search out labor violations. From June, 
1987, through September, 1989, they raided 66 businesses and 21 homes where 
welfare violations were suspected. Cubberly issued 85 labor citations assessing 
nearly $45,000 in fines -- including 13 child labor violations involving 
children ages 13 to 17. 
</P>
<P>
At one home in Westminster, they confiscated 757 knit cardigan sweaters, in 
various stages of completion -- enough to fill six large plastic trash bags, 
Nguyen said. The homeowner, who was collecting welfare, "says he's the only one 
working, making $120 a month," she said. 
</P>
<P>
Altogether, state officials seized 5,022 garments, which were donated to 
charity, Cubberly said. 
</P>
<P>
Men and women who sew in such homes -- and their children -- risk inhaling dust 
and fibers from the heaps of cut fabric in poorly ventilated spaces. 
</P>
<P>
"Eventually, we're going to see tuberculosis, respiratory problems," Otero 
said. 
</P>
<P>
Some of the garments seized in homes or found in factories paying less than the 
minimum wage bear the label of major manufacturers. When called for comment, 
several said they had given cut pieces to reputable, state-registered 
contractors to be sewn. Each one vehemently denied any direct or indirect 
knowledge of the sweatshops. 
</P>
<P>
J. P. Wolk, controller of Oops of California, a women's and children's dress 
manufacturer with annual sales of $20 million, said he had no idea that his 
goods had been confiscated by state inspectors after they were discovered in a 
home. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm not aware of that. They never talked to me," Wolk said. "As far as I know, 
we only deal with reputable contractors. What the contractors do, I have no 
idea." 
</P>
<P>
When such operations are discovered, illegal aliens are reported to the U.S. 
Immigration and Naturalization Service, and welfare frauds are referred to the 
district attorney's office for prosecution, officials said. The sweatshop 
owners are fined for each state labor violation and usually are forced to 
compensate the manufacturer for the cost of the confiscated garments. But, 
state officials said, manufacturers are almost never prosecuted. 
</P>
<P>
"You'd have to catch the manufacturer in the house with the garments and the 
machines," said John B. Carter, senior deputy labor commissioner for the state 
Division of Labor Enforcement in Santa Ana. "It's impossible." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
LABOR LAWS 
</P>
<P>
 These are the state and federal labor laws that apply to garment workers: 
</P>
<P>
 Minimum Wage: President Bush recently signed legislation to raise the federal 
minimum wage to $4.25 an hour by 1991, but that move will not affect 
California, where the state-mandated minimum wage is already $4.25 per hour. 
Trainees with no experience may be paid $3.60 an hour for up to 160 hours. 
</P>
<P>
Overtime: Garment workers, like other non-salaried employees, must be paid 
time-and-a-half if they work more than eight hours a day or 40 hours a week. 
</P>
<P>
Home Sewing: Sewing commercially at home is a misdemeanor under California law. 
The state law supersedes federal law, which allows some types of home work but 
prohibits sewing women's garments at home. 
</P>
<P>
Registration: Under the Montoya Act, all garment contractors must register with 
the state and pass a licensing exam that covers all applicable laws. The 1981 
law also requires shops to keep wage and hour records. 
</P>
<P>
Child Labor: Children under 12 may not work. Children ages 12 to 14 may not 
work on school days. All those under 18 must have a permit from their school 
districts, and in any case may not work more than 36 hours per week. 
</P>
