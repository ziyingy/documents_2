The Ocean View High School boys' basketball team had a simple game plan Friday 
night against Marina: Stop 6-foot-10 center Cherokee Parks. 
</P>
<P>
The Seahawks did just that, limiting Parks to only 14 points en route to an 
71-41 Sunset League victory in front of 2,000 at Ocean View. 
</P>
<P>
The victory moves Ocean View (17-8 overall, 7-3 in league) into a first-place 
tie with Huntington Beach and Edison in the league standings. League coaches 
flipped a coin late Friday night to decide the three teams' seedings. Edison 
will be the top-seeded team, followed by Huntington Beach and Ocean View. 
Marina ends its season at 10-15, 3-7.

"We knew if Parks got going he would be impossible to stop, " Ocean View Coach 
Jim Harris said. "Todd Norman did an outstanding job keeping him away from the 
basket tonight and that made a big difference." 
</P>
<P>
Ocean View also used a effective full-court pressure defense that forced 23 
Marina turnovers, which led to several baskets. 
</P>
<P>
The Seahawks opened a 41-23 halftime lead and increased it to 71-35 with less 
than five minutes to play. 
</P>
<P>
Norman led all scorers with 19 points and 10 rebounds and teammate Mike Frohn 
added 17. Thi Nguyen had 11 points for Marina.
