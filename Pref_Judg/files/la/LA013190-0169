<P>
Maury Wills was about to tee off at Los Coyotes Golf Course when he saw a 
camera crew trudging toward him. 
</P>
<P>
It was Dodger Day at the Buena Park course, that October day in 1972. So Wills 
thought the camera crew was coming to interview him, to get a look at his 
swing. You know, do one of those cute features. 
</P>
<P>
Wills hit a strong drive down the middle of the fairway and, when he looked up, 
the camera was rolling. Feeling proud, he strode to the microphone. 
</P>
<P>
"Maury," the reporter said, "you've just been released by the Dodgers. Do you 
have any comments?" 
</P>
<P>
Wills was shaken, his insides screamed and his mind began to race. He said all 
of the right things, but the words didn't come from the heart. 
</P>
<P>
This was exactly the way Wills had not wanted it to happen. 
</P>
<P>
Hadn't the Dodgers assured him they would tell him in advance, that he wouldn't 
find out from the media, or from a car radio? Maybe he would even have a news 
conference, as Willie Mays and some other players had. Hadn't the Dodgers 
assured him of that? 
</P>
<P>
And then, resentment set in. 
</P>
<P>
"The best years of my life, genetically speaking, were when I was young, 
productive and strong, performing away at life and trying to perfect 
something," Wills said of being released. 
</P>
<P>
"But for the amount of time I really enjoyed, the rewards are very few. And 
now, I'm on my way down, going through hell, trying to hold on as an older 
player. And now, I'm out of the game and I'm trying to make this transition, 
and they don't need me anymore. 
</P>
<P>
"Some baseball players, after their career, go on to have nice normal 
productive lives, but a lot of us fall prey to disaster, because (life after 
baseball) is the (real) big leagues." 
</P>
<P>
Wills spent 8 1/2 years in the minor leagues before he made it to the majors. 
In 1959, he was called up by the Dodgers to replace injured shortstop Don 
Zimmer. The Dodgers traded him to Pittsburgh in 1967, and he also played 47 
games for Montreal before returning to the Dodgers in 1969. 
</P>
<P>
As hard as Wills worked at being a player, he has struggled far more since his 
playing days. Merely trying to deal with life. 
</P>
<P>
Sometimes, merely trying to get through a day. 
</P>
<P>
 If I could do it all over again I might change it and be something else. If I 
could look in a crystal ball, maybe I wouldn't have worked so hard to be as 
good as I was. Maybe it wouldn't have been so important to me to win. Because 
the reward of the ring and the World Series share does not measure up to the 
disaster that I have been through. 
</P>
<P>
 -- Maury Wills, Jan. 18, 1990 
</P>
<P>
It wasn't as though he became impoverished, unless poverty is measured as a 
lack of contentment. By 1981, Maury Wills as poor. 
</P>
<P>
He had been the most exciting player on the base paths since Jackie Robinson. 
In 1962, Wills won the league's most-valuable-player award when he stole 104 
bases, breaking Ty Cobb's record of 96 set in 1915. Most baseball experts agree 
that Wills' baserunning style revived base stealing as a major offensive weapon 
and made him a legend in the sport. 
</P>
<P>
His next endeavor, as a broadcaster, also was successful. He was a baseball 
commentator with NBC for six years and then spent another year as the co-host 
for his own show on HBO. 
</P>
<P>
And in 1980, his boyhood dream of being a manager came true, with the Seattle 
Mariners. This time, however, he was not a success. And when he was fired by 
Seattle after 82 games, on May 6, 1981, Wills says he became a drug user. 
</P>
<P>
For 3 1/2 years, he rarely ventured from his bedroom, the master suite in his 
14-room house in Playa Del Rey. He sat alone, day after day, in total darkness, 
using drugs and alcohol. Somehow, cocaine made him feel right, and made 
everybody else wrong. 
</P>
<P>
At night, he stared at the Pacific Ocean through the big bay window in his 
bedroom until he saw imaginary people looking in on him. Then he put the 
blankets up, leaving them there all day to keep the sunshine out. 
</P>
<P>
Sometimes, when things got real bad, he would find some old black and white 
photographs of himself as a ballplayer, and, in the stillness of the night, he 
could even hear the cheers. 
</P>
<P>
But the cheers had long since turned to jeers and criticism. As a manager, he 
had not only failed in the won-lost column, but in his ability to communicate 
with his players, coaches and the media. He had been erratic and troubled, and 
it reflected on his performance. 
</P>
<P>
Wills now says his troubles were triggered by a broken romance. He says the 
love of his life, whom he declined to identify, broke up with him and ran off 
with another ballplayer, someone Wills had introduced her to. It made him 
crazy. He couldn't concentrate, and he was obsessed by it. 
</P>
<P>
"I'll never forget," Wills said. "I was in Milwaukee in this big suite in the 
hotel. There were rooms all over the place and I'm the major league manager, 
and I cried myself to sleep all night long. Everyone I called back here in 
California that I needed to talk to, I couldn't reach. I couldn't reach her. 
</P>
<P>
"This is a time when my disease is surfacing, I'm getting into depression now . 
. . and my irregular behavior is beginning to develop and is coming on." 
</P>
<P>
"So now I go back (to Los Angeles) and the season is over and I can't find her, 
and I went crazy all winter." 
</P>
<P>
Shortly after spring training began, in 1981, Wills learned that the woman had 
run off with the ballplayer. He says that pushed him over the edge. 
</P>
<P>
Wills says he also became "acquainted" with the drug scene that winter before 
spring training. But he says he did not start using drugs until after he was 
fired by Seattle, three weeks into the regular season. 
</P>
<P>
Humiliated and embarrassed, Wills locked himself up in his house. 
</P>
<P>
Then in August, 1983, Fred Claire, executive vice president of the Dodgers, and 
Don Newcombe, former Dodger pitcher, took Wills to a substance-abuse center. 
Wills didn't want to be recognized, so he registered under an assumed name, 
Donald Claire. 
</P>
<P>
"I had been there about 10 days, and I wasn't really participating, I was just 
there," Wills said. "The first time that I was in a group discussion with other 
patients, I wouldn't look the leader in the eye, because I didn't want to talk. 
</P>
<P>
"Well, it was finally my turn to talk. I got a lump in my throat and tears 
welled up in my eyes and I stood up and said, 'First of all, I have to admit to 
you that my name really isn't Donald Claire.' And the whole group looked up and 
said, 'No kidding, Maury!' " 
</P>
<P>
It was a 28-day program, but Wills lasted only 25. He went back to his house 
and locked himself up. And when he ventured out, he got into trouble. 
</P>
<P>
On Dec. 27, 1983, Wills, driving a car that had been reported as stolen, was 
stopped and arrested for possessing an estimated $7 worth of cocaine. The auto 
theft charge was dropped by the car's owner, reportedly a friend of Wills, who 
said she had not known that Wills had borrowed her car. 
</P>
<P>
On April 7, 1984, the drug possession charge was dismissed because of 
insufficient evidence. But the damage was done. 
</P>
<P>
 People say, "Oh yeah, he's OK now. Well, how long is that going to last?" That 
is so cruel. There are no guarantees. I am fighting the greatest battle of my 
life now, and maybe it's what I need to keep me busy. It's an everyday, all-day 
job. I'll never get well, I'll only get better. 
</P>
<P>
 -- Maury Wills 
</P>
<P>
Maury Wills says he is clean today -- clean as in drug- and alcohol-free -- and 
he says he has been clean for six consecutive months. He says that is the 
longest time he has been clean since he started using drugs in 1981. 
</P>
<P>
That first trip to the care center was the beginning of many such trips for 
Wills, who is now tested weekly at the Community Health Projects clinic and is 
in therapy with Dr. Joan Elvidge. The Dodgers pay Wills' rehabilitation 
expenses, and weekly reports are sent to Claire. 
</P>
<P>
Wills is working as a public-relations agent for Cellular Dynamics Telephone 
Company in Inglewood. He plays golf, has lunch and sign autographs for clients. 
He says he feels a part of the work team, the first time he has ever felt a 
part of any group. 
</P>
<P>
"I never felt a part of it as a major league baseball star, " Wills said. "I 
had 90,000 people in the Coliseum cheering, 'Go! Go! Go!' and at Dodger Stadium 
there were 56,000 and another 2,000 in the parking lot waiting for my autograph 
after the game. And I've gone home and cried myself to sleep. 
</P>
<P>
"That's why it's so important to me to show I am really involved with this 
company. I'm not somebody they (the company) are exploiting, putting out there 
and pasting up like with so many athletes -- with car dealerships and such. 
It's not like that here at all." 
</P>
<P>
Wills, along with Mike Celizic, a writer for the Bergen (N.J.) Record, is also 
writing a book that is expected to be published in June. 
</P>
<P>
At 57, Wills appears to be as fit as ever. He still has that gray patch of hair 
in front, but now it blends in better. 
</P>
<P>
More important, Wills says, for maybe the first time in his life, he is finding 
happiness. 
</P>
<P>
"Somewhere along the line, I left God, He didn't leave me," said Wills, whose 
father was a Baptist minister. "When I played, I used to thank God for every 
stolen base, every hit. 
</P>
<P>
"Now, as long as I have God with me, to guide me and love me, as long as I stay 
in contact with God, I will love myself and be good to myself this time, and 
not let myself fall prey to things again. 
</P>
<P>
"I know how to recognize danger signs of things that are not good for me and I 
don't involve myself with it. I go into things now with my partner, my higher 
power." 
</P>
<P>
One of the things Wills tries to stay away from is talk of his failure to be 
elected to the Hall of Fame. Eligible since 1978, Wills came closest to 
election in 1979, when he received 166 votes, or 51%. That year, 324 votes were 
needed for election. 
</P>
<P>
The votes are cast by 10-year members of the Baseball Writers Assn. of America. 
To be elected, a player must receive 75% of the vote. 
</P>
<P>
"I used to make a conscious effort to try to stay clean and sober just to get 
through the voting period -- if that's what made the difference -- so that 
maybe I could be elected," Wills said. "But not making it affected my 
self-esteem, and, as each time went by, I would sink more and more." 
</P>
<P>
The number of votes cast for Wills dropped significantly after he was fired by 
the Mariners -- from 163 votes in 1981 to 91 in 1982. The most he has received 
since is 127 in 1988 -- after a period during which Wills was somewhat visible 
again in the baseball community, although mainly at baseball card shows. Each 
of the last two years, Wills has received 95 votes. 
</P>
<P>
"He hasn't received much consideration on Hall of Fame voting, and one thing 
that hurt him was his problems as a manager," said Allen Lewis, who covered the 
Phillies for the Philadelphia Inquirer when Wills was a player, and who is also 
a member of the Baseball Hall of Fame Veterans Committee. 
</P>
<P>
"It's probably unfair to penalize him as a player for what happened to him as a 
manager, but people are human. He didn't play that long, perhaps too few 
outstanding years to get him in (as an overall player). But he influenced the 
game without question, and if he makes it, it would be because he helped change 
the game and made speed important." 
</P>
<P>
If Wills fails to make the Hall of Fame in the next two years, he will have to 
wait three years before he can be considered for election by the Veteran's 
Committee, which is composed of 18 members. 
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Wills says, he beginning to seriously doubt that he will ever be 
elected. 
</P>
<P>
"There is something about Maury Wills that bothers people and diminishes their 
respect for me, and I don't know what it is, but it has always been this way," 
Wills said. "Maybe it's that I was arrogant and cocky. But it has been a part 
of the problem and helped to contribute to my behavior problems. 
</P>
<P>
"It's not healthy for me to try to take someone else's inventory and think, 
'Why?' I had to let go of wanting to be in baseball in some capacity and let go 
of wanting to be in the Hall of Fame. I had to surrender and this is what 
helped me to get turned around. There is less rejection this way and a lot of 
my fears have left me." 
</P>
<P>
Wills doesn't think he is capable of having an intimate relationship again. 
"Relationships and sex, that's what got me messed up in the first place," he 
says. 
</P>
<P>
Wills also no longer aspires to a managing career, but he would like to be an 
instructor. He believes that he is one of the best instructors on baserunning 
in the game. 
</P>
<P>
He would be content, he says, simply to spend a few weeks a season working with 
players. He doesn't need any more than that now, he says. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm in a position where having a higher power in my life allows me to have 
clarity, and gives me the acceptance to feel a part of it now," Wills said. 
</P>
<P>
"I've been in situations where people have been raving over me, but that is 
Maury Wills the baseball player, the base stealer. Nobody ever knew Maury Wills 
personally. I didn't even know myself because I got wrapped up in the hoopla. 
</P>
<P>
"Somehow, all the years that I was highly acclaimed, somehow, I was always 
reminded that still, I was just a nigger, just a baseball player." 
</P>
<P>
Now, he is merely Maury Wills, hoping that being Maury Wills is enough. 
</P>
