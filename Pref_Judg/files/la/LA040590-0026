The surprisingly strong storm that began Tuesday night and continued through 
Wednesday morning caused nearly 100 minor traffic accidents throughout the 
area, officials said.

Although occasionally heavy rain fell in some parts of the county, the official 
measuring station at Lindbergh Field recorded only .30 inches of rain during 
the storm, National Weather Service meteorologist Dan Atkin said.

However, slippery roads caused 98 traffic accidents, many of them during rush 
hour Wednesday morning, leaving Interstates 5 and 15 jammed for miles, 
California Highway Patrol spokesman Tim Santillan said. No injuries were 
reported.

On I-5 near Hill Street in Oceanside, a van skidded into the center divider and 
overturned. On I-5 near La Costa Avenue in Carlsbad, a car spun into the center 
divider and landed sideways, and another driver braked and slid into the car.

Meanwhile, nearly 8,000 customers experienced temporary power outages Wednesday 
morning, San Diego Gas &amp; Electric Co. spokeswoman Laura Farmer said.

<P>
In Clairemont, 3,500 customers were without power for more than a hour 
beginning at 7:30 a.m. after a tree branch hit an electrical line. The same 
problem occurred in Mission Valley at 7:40 a.m., leaving another 3,500 
customers without power for almost an hour and a half. In La Jolla, 950 
customers were without power from 5:30 to 7:30 a.m.

"We're not sure if the outages were storm-related," Farmer said. "Water on the 
lines could have broken them or made them hang low."

on and off from Tuesday night to Wednesday morning."
