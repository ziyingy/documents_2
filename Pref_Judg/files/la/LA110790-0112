Birds were born to fly, fish to swim and humans to walk the earth. The first

The other's inclination to tempt the order of nature has led 40 apparently 
stable and intelligent men and women to Perris Valley Airport south of 
Riverside, where they have climbed aboard an ancient plane and sit on the floor 
toboggan style, backs toward a wide-open door. All wear grins, goggles, jump 
suits and parachutes, but the 'chutes are only for the last few thousand feet. 
These folks are about to try to fly.

For an experienced skydiver, stepping out of an airplane is as natural as 
falling off a log -- a log 2 1/2 miles up. 
</P>
<P>
"It's so natural, it takes very little training," says Tim Domenico, who has 
jumped about 600 times. 
</P>
<P>
It's an everyday occurrence at Perris Valley, 365 days a year. 
</P>
<P>
"We're aerodynamic," Domenico says. "We leave the airplane when it's going 85 
or 90, which is more than enough air to control your body with little (effort) 
. . . tilt, tuck a shoulder in, stick your legs out, turn with your hands." 
</P>
<P>
It's not cheap -- $18 apiece for the airplane, every time up. The sport costs 
from $2,000 to $10,000 a year, depending on the level of activity. 
</P>
<P>
"But how much would you pay to feel like Superman for 60 seconds?" Domenico 
asks. 
</P>
<P>
In free-falling at a terminal velocity of 120 m.p.h., or 175 feet a second, 
skydivers say they feel more like they're flying than falling. Since it's 
advisable not to land at that speed, they still have to pull the rip cord -- 
except these days they call it the hand deploy pilot chute, a tiny parachute 
that leads the main chute out of the pack. 
</P>
<P>
There's still a big handle for the rip cord on the reserve chute but, hey, they 
hardly ever need that. 
</P>
<P>
Skydiving has come a long way since the 1960s, when white, round, umbrella-like 
military surplus chutes were standard and people broke legs landing at 17 
m.p.h., the equivalent of an eight-foot drop. Now, everybody uses a rectangular 
canopy in his favorite colors, and it is so controllable that, with a little 
practice, a person can turn into the wind and stall just before settling softly 
onto the ground, like stepping off a bus. 
</P>
<P>
"The sport has changed dramatically in the 15 years I've been in it," said 
Domenico, who publishes Paraglider magazine for a later discipline that takes 
skydiving a step farther into inflated canopies for longer flights. 
</P>
<P>
"It used to be a bunch of people would drive a mile out of town to a little 
airfield. Half were drunk. There were very few women. There was a time when a 
third of the jumpers in the sport were Hells Angels. But they wouldn't fit in 
here now. They'd feel terribly out of place." 
</P>
<P>
Nobody seems to have a death wish. 
</P>
<P>
"If they did, they wouldn't do this sport, because this sport is not that 
deadly," Domenico said. "We're not daredevils." 
</P>
<P>
Skydivers say there is a rate of only one chute malfunction every 1,000 jumps 
-- and there's always a mandatory reserve chute, which must be inspected and 
repacked by a rigger certified by the Federal Aviation Administration every 
four months. 
</P>
<P>
Perris Valley leads the world with about 100,000 jumps a year. The only 
fatality there in recent memory occurred in September, and it was listed as a 
suicide by the Riverside County coroner because the diver was believed to be 
depressed over personal problems and apparently made no attempt to deploy 
either of his chutes. 
</P>
<P>
He was not typical. Instead, the typical skydiver now "is 26 to 35 years old 
(and) the average educational level is probably two years of college," Domenico 
said. "Fifty percent are probably independent business people. A lot of these 
people are professionals, college educated, drive nice cars with telephones." 
</P>
<P>
Domenico has described the modern young upscale professional: a yuppie. They 
have found their recreational niche. 
</P>
<P>
Tom Falzone, 30, is a product marketing agent from La Canada with 1,300 jumps. 
Two years ago he was part of the 144-way (person) world-record link-up 
formation at Quincy, Ill. 
</P>
<P>
"My first time I was very scared, but I had a great desire to try," he said. 
"Before my parachute landed me on the ground I was hooked." 
</P>
<P>
About 15% of the 23,000 skydivers registered by the United States Parachute 
Assn. are women. Diana Ransome, 32, a schoolteacher from Moreno Valley, with 
450 jumps, said: "It's a stress release, an escape from reality after getting 
from Monday through Friday. (The other teachers) think I'm crazy. They're all 
happy to see me walk into the lounge on Monday morning." 
</P>
<P>
Linda Scalfano, 25, an engineer at McDonnell Douglas, with 57 jumps, said: "I 
relaxed once I finally got it into my head that this was a fun thing. When I 
finished my student jumps I was really proud of myself -- more than when I 
graduated from college. But I don't bring it up at work because I get tired of 
people asking, 'Why would you want to jump out of a perfectly good airplane?' " 
</P>
<P>
Why, indeed? 
</P>
<P>
Domenico said: "The great misconception about this sport is that we jump out of 
airplanes for the thrill of seeing if our parachutes will open. Equipment has 
evolved to where we don't even think about it. We think about the free-fall." 
</P>
<P>
There are notices posted that anyone reported consuming alcohol -- even a beer 
-- or drugs on the day of a jump will be grounded for 60 days. 
</P>
<P>
"We don't see that twice a year," Domenico said. "But he will be reported, 
because he's not just risking his life." 
</P>
<P>
One of the older skydivers, who has about 5,300 jumps in 31 years, gave his age 
as 52 and his name only as Mongo.

"I don't drink, don't do drugs," he said. "All the rush in the world is here." 
</P>
<P>
"We're adrenaline junkies," said Kate Cooper, who runs the pro shop at the 
skydiving center. "You don't need anything else. It's the best drug there is. 
Your body creates it, and it's free."

 "Skydivers are good to the last drop."

 -- Skydiver dark humor 
</P>
<P>
Veteran skydivers claim their sport is safer than driving to the airport to do 
it -- not that it's so safe it's boring, but after several hundred jumps some 
of the skydivers look for greater challenges. 
</P>
<P>
The 40 in the DC-3 this day are trying out for the 110-way team that will try 
to set a state record at Perris Valley Dec. 7-9. They must link up for three 
seconds to make it official. 
</P>
<P>
They'll start to break up at 4,500 feet, and "we want to be open by 2,000 
feet," says Mark Pharr, who with Cooper and instructor Jeff Jones is organizing 
the attempt. "That allows us time (11 1/2 seconds) to use the reserve parachute 
if we need to." 
</P>
<P>
Linking up the formation, or "blot," involves six phases -- exit, dive, track, 
flare (slow), lurk (wait) and dock -- during which each diver must find his 
assigned slot. A skilled diver can vary his speed from 60 to 200 m.p.h. 
</P>
<P>
A photographer and reporter go along for the ride to 12,500 feet -- and the 
ride back down in the DC-3. 
</P>
<P>
"They've told me if I keep you guys from falling out of the airplane I'll get a 
free jump," Domenico says. 
</P>
<P>
Nevertheless, the non-jumpers are required to wear chutes, and Pharr offers 
some brief instruction. 
</P>
<P>
The most important thing he says is: "If the pilot goes out, you follow him." 
</P>
<P>
After a 25-minute climb, the DC-3 levels off. Cooper announces "jump run" and 
holds up three fingers -- meaning, three minutes. At "one minute," three 
"floaters" step out the door and hang onto a handhold. They'll let go when the 
first divers exit, the purpose being to get everybody free-falling as close 
together as possible. 
</P>
<P>
The divers inside are standing in a tightly bunched conga line, and at the 
commands "ready . . . set . . . go!" they charge out the door in lock step, 
like a centipede. They're all gone in 10 seconds, leaving the plane's 
passengers to study the skydiving slogans on the wall. 
</P>
<P>
 "If at first you don't succeed. . ."
