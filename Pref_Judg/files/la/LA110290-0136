Tickets for a second Bruce Springsteen-Bonnie Raitt-Jackson Browne benefit 
concert at the Shrine Auditorium will go on sale Saturday under a "restricted" 
system that concert sponsors hope will make it harder for scalpers to get 
tickets.

Proceeds from the 8 p.m. performance on Nov. 17 will benefit the 
Washington-based Christic Institute, an interfaith nonprofit center for law and 
public policy.

Tom Campbell, director of Avocado Productions, said his office received 
complaints about ticket scalping last month when seating for the Nov. 16 date 
at the Shrine sold out in 45 minutes. At that time, tickets were sold at the 
Shrine box office, 80 Ticketron locations and also by phone.

Tickets for the second concert -- priced at $25, $50 and $100 -- will go on 
sale at 9 a.m. Saturday exclusively at Tower Records' Ticketron outlets in 
Anaheim, Brea, El Toro, Hollywood, Lakewood, Northridge, Panorama City, 
Thousand Oaks, Torrance, West Covina and Westwood. A strict 4-ticket limit will 
be enforced.

This time, no tickets will be available at the Shrine Auditorium box office and 
no phone orders will be taken. Priority number wristbands -- 200 per outlet -- 
will be distributed randomly at 8 a.m. No one will be allowed to line up at any 
Tower Ticketron location before 7 a.m. Extra security will be at all locations 
to monitor sales and to make sure that no favoritism is shown and that the 
tickets go to people in line, Campbell said. CHUCK PHILIPS
