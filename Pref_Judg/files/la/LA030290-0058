Just after they finished the long trek from El Salvador to the United States 
six years ago, 14-year-old Miguel Perez made one last promise to his dying 
mother. 
</P>
<P>
"I told her that I would succeed, that I would become somebody," said Perez, 
now 20. "She gave up her life for me." 
</P>
<P>
After years of hard work and study, Perez has kept his promise. Today, he is a 
standout third-year psychology student at Cal State Dominguez Hills and was 
recently offered a summer research position at Penn State. 
</P>
<P>
But Perez's academic career may be cut short, and his drive to succeed may be 
frustrated if, as scheduled, he is deported March 9 by the U.S. Immigration and 
Naturalization Service. 
</P>
<P>
Since university officials learned of the pending deportation order a week ago, 
they have rallied to support him, writing letters and making phone calls to 
immigration officials and U.S. congressmen. 
</P>
<P>
The campaign to halt the deportation was just the latest episode of a saga that 
started with Perez leaving the port city of La Union in eastern El Salvador and 
finally arriving in South Gate to begin an uncertain life as an undocumented 
immigrant. 
</P>
<P>
Perez and his mother were detained by U.S. Border Patrol agents minutes after 
they illegally crossed the Mexican border on foot near San Ysidro in January, 
1984. 
</P>
<P>
After a few weeks in separate INS detention cells, both were released when they 
applied for political asylum. Soon afterward, Perez's mother died and he became 
an orphan at 14. 
</P>
<P>
Perez's asylum application dragged through immigration court for more than five 
years, until last December when his final appeal before the Board of 
Immigration Appeals was denied. 
</P>
<P>
Immigration attorneys say cases such as Perez's are common among young 
undocumented immigrants in Southern California who have been abandoned by their 
parents or whose parents have died since coming to the United States. Even 
though the young immigrants may have grown into adulthood in this country, they 
face deportation if they have been unable to legalize their status. 
</P>
<P>
Peter Schey, executive director of the Center for Human Rights and 
Constitutional Law, said in the past few years his agency has handled several 
hundred cases of young immigrants who have been returned, alone, to their 
native countries. 
</P>
<P>
"We've received collect calls from children at the airport in San Salvador, 
saying, 'What do I do? I'm here at the airport? Where do I go? I don't have any 
money,' " Schey said. 
</P>
<P>
Immigration officials said youths are turned over to the proper authorities in 
the countries to which they are deported. 
</P>
<P>
"We don't just flip them across the border," said INS spokesman Joe Flanders. 
Once an immigration judge orders a deportation, the INS must carry it out. In 
some cases, Flanders said, immigration officials will provide a small stipend 
to indigent deportees. 
</P>
<P>
In denying Perez political asylum in May, 1988, Immigration Judge Robert 
Griffin said Perez had "failed to establish that his life or freedom would be 
threatened in El Salvador." Perez's attorneys counter that the Santa Ana lawyer 
who originally handled the asylum application simply neglected to present 
evidence to show Perez might be in danger if he returned to his homeland. 
</P>
<P>
Because Perez has grown into adulthood in the United States, he worries that he 
may find it difficult to adjust to life in El Salvador if forced to return. He 
speaks both English and Spanish fluently and his friends say he seems to be 
almost as American as he is Salvadoran. 
</P>
<P>
Most immigrants deported from the United States to El Salvador know that, at 
the very least, a familiar culture will be waiting for them. Perez, however, 
doesn't even have any living relatives there. 
</P>
<P>
"There's no one for him to go back to in El Salvador," said Carl M. Shusterman, 
one of his attorneys. "He's completely Americanized." 
</P>
<P>
Perez said of his possible return to El Salvador: "It certainly would be 
reverse cultural shock. I've been accustomed to the way we do things here." 
</P>
<P>
Shusterman and Jay Segal, who is also representing Perez, said they don't blame 
the INS for the scheduled deportation. 
</P>
<P>
Shusterman said after reviewing court documents he believes that the attorney 
who originally handled Perez's asylum application displayed "total 
incompetence." 
</P>
<P>
In one 1988 court appearance, the Santa Ana attorney who represented him 
presented no documentary evidence to support Perez's claim that he had reason 
to fear persecution if he was returned to El Salvador, Shusterman said. 
</P>
<P>
"Miguel's interests were not served. His case showed a total lack of 
preparation," Segal added. "I have never seen this in 30 years of practice." 
</P>
<P>
The attorney was suspended by the State Bar of California in 1988, bar 
officials said. He faces a variety of allegations in State Bar Court, including 
that he misled a Canadian immigrant applying for a "green card," a temporary 
residency card. 
</P>
<P>
Shusterman, a former INS prosecutor, said he would file an appeal next week in 
Perez's case before the U.S. Court of Appeals for the 9th Circuit in San 
Francisco. He also directed Perez to request asylum, as a last resort, from the 
Canadian Consulate in Los Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
At Cal State Dominguez Hills, school officials expressed shock that the popular 
and successful student soon might be forced out of the country. 
</P>
<P>
"He's just a tremendous young man," said Catherine Shaffer, a financial aid 
counselor who said she invited Perez to spend last Christmas with her family in 
Ukiah, in Northern California. "This is devastating. Everyone here is writing 
letters and doing what needs to be done to keep him here." 
</P>
<P>
University Vice President Louis Murdock contacted the office of Rep. Mervyn M. 
Dymally (D-Los Angeles) to plead Perez's case. Dymally's office contacted 
Shusterman's law firm, which agreed to take the case. 
</P>
<P>
Perez belongs to several student organizations at the university, including an 
association of minority social-science researchers. He has written articles for 
the newsletter of the Chicano News Media Assn., criticizing U.S. immigration 
authorities for their policies on political asylum cases. He also once served 
as volunteer photo editor for Americas 2001, a Latino-affairs magazine. 
</P>
<P>
And even though he is not an American citizen, on several occasions he has 
written to his congressmen to criticize U.S. support for the Salvadoran 
government. Perez's attorneys say the letters may place his life in danger if 
he must return to El Salvador. 
</P>
<P>
"I came to the conclusion that U.S. aid to El Salvador does more harm than 
good," Perez said, explaining why he wrote the letters. "It leaves no 
possibility for change in the country. A few rich people are in power." 
</P>
<P>
Teachers at South Gate High School, which Perez entered in 1984 while living 
with his sister and an elderly aunt, find it remarkable that Perez has 
progressed so far in his studies. When he first came to the school, he "didn't 
know a word of English," said Rena Patton, an instructor in English as a second 
language. 
</P>
<P>
Within a year, Perez had mastered the language, Patton said. Eventually, he 
graduated 12th in a class of more than 500 seniors. 
</P>
<P>
"He's probably the most outstanding student I've ever had in my career as a 
teacher," Patton said. 
</P>
<P>
Perez returns to the high school every semester to talk to Spanish-speaking 
students about the importance of seeking an education, Patton said. 
</P>
<P>
"That's the remarkable thing about him. He didn't just take from the school and 
run away. He's wanted to put back into education what he took out. . . . If 
he's forced to go to Canada, it will be their gain and our loss." 
</P>
<P>
If he returns to El Salvador, Perez will for the first time visit the grave of 
his mother, Elena Manzano, who was buried there after she died in Los Angeles 
of heart disease at the age of 61.
