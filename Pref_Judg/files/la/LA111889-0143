Fresno has been ordered to limit the charge for copies of traffic accident 
reports to the actual cost of duplication instead of the $25 fee adopted two 
years ago. The Superior Court decision is the result of a suit filed by the 
California State Automobile Assn., which regularly must obtain copies of 
accident reports to process claims for its insurance customers.
