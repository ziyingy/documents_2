One of the most interesting things about the budget package was the way the 
vote broke. Members who have served more than 12 years in Congress -- the usual 
deadline suggested by those who back term limitations -- voted strongly in 
favor, with nearly 60% voting for passage.

Members with less than six terms voted narrowly against the conference report. 
More than two-thirds of the freshmen were in opposition. Those who had served 
five terms opposed by a nearly equal margin.

Had Congress been limited to junior members, there's a reasonable chance we 
still wouldn't have a budget in place. I say this not because I'm a curmudgeon, 
but rather because I've seen a process work here whereby members become more 
courageous as they become more established and secure in their districts. I'm 
confident today's junior members will be much more willing to take the tough 
votes in another six or eight years.

When we have problems in Washington, it is usually because we lack the 
political will to get the job done. What we need is an environment that 
nurtures and demands that will.
