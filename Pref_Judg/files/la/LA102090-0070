With the sensitive animal rights issue continuously surfacing, voters may read 
too much into Proposition C on the Nov. 6 ballot. Remember, this advisory 
measure asks only whether the county of San Diego should continue to provide 
pound animals for medical research. 
</P>
<P>
We believe that the current county policy of selling a small number of animals 
to UC San Diego School of Medicine for research is acceptable, morally and 
practically. 
</P>
<P>
When the rhetoric is set aside, the essential facts are these: UCSD performs 
valuable medical research that could lead to progress in fighting diseases 
afflicting both humans and animals. While researchers use some animals bred 
specifically for research, certain experiments require older animals or ones 
subjected to the real world. 
</P>
<P>
UCSD purchased only a few hundred of the 24,000 animals brought to county 
shelters over a recent 12-month period. Before an animal is made available for 
research, it is held to allow pet owners to claim it. 
</P>
<P>
Most of the pound animals used by the medical school would be euthanized 
anyway. If pound animals are made unavailable, they will die along with 
additional ones bred for research. More animals will perish, not fewer. 
</P>
<P>
Opponents of the system claim that animals used in research inevitably suffer, 
physically and emotionally, more than those euthanized. We are not insensitive 
to that pain, but must conclude that, on balance, the present system is the 
best resolution of a difficult situation. 
</P>
<P>
We recommend a yes vote on Proposition C.
