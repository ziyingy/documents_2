All those years working as a newspaper reporter have paid off for Brea author 
Jackie Hyman. 
</P>
<P>
The heroine of Hyman's new Orange County-set suspense-thriller "Echoes" is 
Laura Bennett, a young reporter who, in investigating the sudden death of a 
U.S. senator, begins to uncover unexplained phenomena that link his death with 
other strange events. 
</P>
<P>
Indeed, some unusual and sinister things are happening in San Paradiso, Hyman's 
fictional Orange County town. 
</P>
<P>
The mayor was the last person to see three local women before each was brutally 
murdered. But he knows he didn't kill them -- at least he doesn't remember 
killing them. 
</P>
<P>
The senator's wife, a former B-movie actress, receives an anonymous package 
containing a photo of herself at an orgy she had fantasized about. But she 
knows it never really happened. 
</P>
<P>
And Bennett, who is haunted by childhood memories of her father's plunge into 
madness, discovers that her lover, a judge, is not acting like himself. 
</P>
<P>
Hyman's publisher, Morrow, is promoting "Echoes" as "a slam-bang supernatural 
thriller skillfully combining elements of 'The Omen' and 'Invasion of the Body 
Snatchers.' . . . What unfolds is a waking nightmare, as a plague of demonic 
duplicates turns Orange County red with blood in a tidal wave of murder, rape 
and blackmail." 
</P>
<P>
Hyman, who quit newspaper work in 1983 to devote full time to writing fiction, 
has written 23 romance novels under such various pen names as Jacqueline 
Diamond, Jacqueline Topaz and Jacqueline Jade. 
</P>
<P>
"Echoes" is her second thriller under her own name. (Her first was "The Eyes of 
a Stranger," also set in Orange County.) 
</P>
<P>
"I've enjoyed the romances, and I think I've done a good job on them," she 
said. "I'd never slight them, but I do like to be able to try different things 
and not hold back and restrict my thinking." 
</P>
<P>
In creating the young reporter in "Echoes," Hyman tapped into her six years as 
a reporter with the Orange Coast Daily Pilot in Costa Mesa and three years with 
the Associated Press in Los Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
"I used my reporting experience both in the actual setting and the details of 
how the news is gathered, and also the feeling you get as a reporter on how the 
community functions," she said. "A reporter on a fairly small paper who has a 
small city as her beat has an incredible range (of experiences) and is an 
amazing resource person." 
</P>
<P>
As for newspaper work being good preparation for writing novels, Hyman said: "I 
think the writing (experience) is good. But it can handicap you in that your 
style may tend to be very terse. On the other hand, you get used to writing to 
deadline and not giving into writer's block." 
</P>
<P>
Although much of "Echoes" occurs in Newport Beach, Hyman chose to create a 
fictional town for the main action to avoid the potential of libeling someone 
or having to worry about the irrelevant details about how a town actually 
functions. 
</P>
<P>
She nevertheless wanted San Paradiso to be as realistically "normal" as 
possible. 
</P>
<P>
"One of the things I don't like about a lot of horror novels is they take place 
where you'd never actually go -- where the mayor looks like Burgess Meredith 
and the real estate agent looks like Boris Karloff -- and if you did go there 
you'd leave. 
</P>
<P>
"I wanted to write something really frightening. To me the most frightening 
thing would be to live in this perfectly normal place and these strange things 
start happening, and you realize there is no escape. 
</P>
<P>
"I find that more frightening than some weird, small town."
