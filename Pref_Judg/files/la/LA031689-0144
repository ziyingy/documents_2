Few of the 6,000 Ventura County residents who are sent every year to Alcohol 
Information School want to be there. Most believe it was simply bad luck, not 
booze, that got them convicted of drunk driving in the first place. All grumble 
about having to pay as much as $875 for the honor of attending. 
</P>
<P>
Even under the best of circumstances, the county program can be an 
administrative headache, with many staff members themselves recovering from 
alcoholism and with about 40% of their students being rearrested within seven 
years. 
</P>
<P>
But the task is made all the more difficult by bickering and mismanagement. In 
a Ventura County Grand Jury report issued two weeks ago, the school was 
criticized for its lack of leadership, constant infighting, poor morale, 
unprofessional counseling and the "decline in overall . . . effectiveness" of 
its alcohol classes. 
</P>
<P>
And the county Corrections Services Agency and some Municipal Court judges have 
complained that the school has not kept close enough tabs on its students, who 
are required by state law to attend weekly sessions for periods ranging from 
five weeks to one year. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Spotty Attendance 
</P>
<P>
Last month, prodded to clean up its records, the school found that more than 
1,000 students -- about one-third of the total enrollment at the time -- 
attended classes so spottily that their cases had to be referred to probation 
officers. 
</P>
<P>
"We were in pretty bad shape," said Rudy Aguilar, co-director of the school. 
"You could feel the tension." 
</P>
<P>
To help remedy those woes, school administrators said, new managers are being 
brought in, better truancy reports are being filed and a step-by-step manual 
outlining job descriptions and procedures is being drafted. A formal response 
to the grand jury's report is in the works, they said. 
</P>
<P>
"In my opinion, we operate one of the best schools in the state," said Terry 
Dryer, a senior administrative analyst who was brought in to help clear up the 
mess. "We just had a glitch for a little while." 
</P>
<P>
While school officials said they have already made some improvements, their 
dilemma still reflects the uphill battle that even the best-managed of the 
state's 56 alcohol programs must confront: How do you run a school designed for 
people who don't want to attend? 
</P>
<P>
"There's really no definitive measure of how successful these programs are," 
said Mike Wood, executive director of the California Assn. of Drinking Driver 
Treatment Programs. "There are some success stories . . . but it's not easy 
because you're dealing with people who see it as just another part of the 
sentence. For them, it's like jail time." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Program Effectiveness 
</P>
<P>
Studies in California and nationwide indicate that mandatory alcohol programs 
are generally more effective than doing nothing. But evidence is often 
inconclusive. 
</P>
<P>
A 1981 report by the Orange County Alcohol Program found that participants in a 
yearlong alcohol class were rearrested for drunk driving about half as much as 
people who failed to complete the program. But a report the same year by the 
National Highway Traffic Safety Administration concluded that such programs had 
little effect in modifying behavior, especially for problem drinkers. 
</P>
<P>
Preliminary results of a Ventura County study indicate that the Alcohol 
Information School has helped reduce the number of people who are rearrested 
for drunk driving, although a sizable percentage of former students continue to 
commit the same offenses. 
</P>
<P>
Of 4,200 first-time offenders convicted during 1980 and 1981, 64% had not been 
arrested for driving under the influence seven years later. Alcohol school 
graduates avoided arrest in 66% of the cases, as opposed to 53% of 
non-graduates. 
</P>
<P>
Of 1,200 repeat offenders convicted during the same years, 56% had not been 
rearrested seven years later. Graduates of the school fared better than 
dropouts, 62% to 46%. 
</P>
<P>
"It would be nice to get tremendous results, but I think we have to mark our 
progress in small percentages," said Bill Weinerth, a special projects 
coordinator for the school who is working on the study. "We're dealing with a 
very recalcitrant population that by and large doesn't feel it has a problem." 
</P>
<P>
Others are less hopeful. 
</P>
<P>
"It doesn't get the drunks off the highways," said Ken Sears, who retired last 
year as administrator of the county's Alcohol Programs agency. "It still 
doesn't solve the basic problem." 
</P>
<P>
The $1.3-million program, which is funded entirely by tuition, employs 24 
people who teach a total of 60 classes at any given time. Most classes are 
supplemented by group and individual counseling sessions. Repeat offenders are 
required to attend Alcoholics Anonymous meetings and a monthly workshop with 
victims of drunk drivers. 
</P>
<P>
On a recent evening at the school on Telephone Road in Ventura, a dozen 
students, ranging in age from early 20s to late 50s, gathered in a small 
classroom for a 2 1/2-hour session. 
</P>
<P>
For the first hour, they listened to a tape-recording made by a psychiatrist 
with a dry wit and a Texas accent who talked about the dangers of alcohol 
abuse, as well as cocaine, marijuana, tranquilizers and PCP. 
</P>
<P>
They learned that 250,000 deaths are attributed to alcohol every year, that 
cocaine travels at 120 m.p.h. when it is snorted up the nose and that marijuana 
can linger in the body's fatty tissues for up to 45 days. 
</P>
<P>
In a discussion group, the students evaluated the tape, which one called "very 
informative" and another termed "incredibly boring." 
</P>
<P>
Then they talked about their own drinking problems. One man explained how he 
went from guzzling beer for breakfast to total sobriety; a woman told how she 
has moved from hard liquor to wine coolers. 
</P>
<P>
Outside after class, one woman, a 30-year-old bank teller from Ventura, said 
she was a rebel who found it hard to swallow such information under duress. 
</P>
<P>
But a 21-year-old carpet layer from Piru said the classes sometimes have led 
him to reflect seriously on his drinking. 
</P>
<P>
"It's boring and a pain," he said, "but it's not as bad as I thought it would 
be." 
</P>
