The video is already playing as the Ritz-Carlton bellman unlocks the hotel 
room. His white gloves point around the French Provincial furnishings and 
Italian marble bathroom as an actress on the television screen begins a tour of 
the Dana Point grounds. It is an odd introduction to one of America's best 
hotels -- and Orange County's most luxurious. 
</P>
<P>
It starts out typically enough. Classical music. Regal lion logo. Phrases like 
"The Golden Coast" and "California Riviera" and "Old World Charm." All this to 
describe a palatial cliff-top hotel with a panoramic ocean view, and decor that 
includes a $4-million "museum-quality" art collection -- not to mention a 
300-year-old castle fireplace. 
</P>
<P>
People sip afternoon tea here, we learn. They watch the sun set while a 
tuxedoed piano player performs "The Girl From Ipanema." They smoke after-dinner 
cigars in the Library and sip Civil War-era wine. You know, classy things that 
cost lots of money. 
</P>
<P>
Then come the commercials. Peddling gift shop merchandise such as a $100,000 
necklace and local stores with hand-painted frocks: "Do you ever get the 
impression that your designer dress is everyone else's designer dress?" 
</P>
<P>
And this novel appeal to the discount shopper: "Save enough on your jewelry 
purchases to pay for this vacation!" 
</P>
<P>
In case you hadn't noticed, Orange County's swankiest hotel is pretty swanky. 
</P>
<P>
So what is it like to stay a night at the resort adored by both hotelier queen 
Leona Helmsley and Robin Leach, television host of "Lifestyles of the Rich and 
Famous?" Will you run into Michael Jackson or Magic Johnson or Bob Dylan at the 
ice machine? Can you afford to stay another day or should you just buy that 
used economy car for the family instead? These and other questions may be 
answered later in this story. 
</P>
<P>
Although it calls itself the Ritz-Carlton Laguna Niguel, the hotel is actually 
in Dana Point -- thanks to last year's cityhood vote. 
</P>
<P>
A 45-minute drive from central Orange County, the Ritz-Carlton sits on 17 acres 
overlooking the Pacific Ocean. The Mediterranean-style compound hugs two miles 
of shoreline and, at Salt Creek Beach below the bluff, the water is dotted 
daily with 50 or 60 surfers riding some of the best waves around. 
</P>
<P>
Here in the sub-community known as Monarch Beach, the Ritz-Carlton is the shiny 
crown jewel in what developers envision as the Orange Riviera: million-dollar 
ocean-view homes and luxury hotels from Huntington Beach to Dana Point. But for 
now, there isn't a resort on the California coast that rivals the Ritz-Carlton 
in location, service, proximity to Disneyland. 
</P>
<P>
There are two pools, two spas, tennis courts, a golf course, a gym, organized 
volleyball, a beauty salon, complimentary day care that includes sandcastle 
building and lawn bowling. Eleven gardeners maintain the grounds, a routine 
that includes the weekly replacement of 4,000 flowering plants. And that's just 
the outside of the Ritz. 
</P>
<P>
It is a young resort, 5 years old in August, but an upstart even among luxury 
hotels, according to national travel guide publishers. The Ritz-Carlton 
received five-star and five-diamond ratings, respectively, from Mobil Travel 
Guide and Triple-A Travel Guide -- among the most widely circulated guides in 
the country. The Ritz is the only resort in California to have received both 
top honors, and one of only 10 in the country. 
</P>
<P>
"I remember the first time I drove up to see it years ago, and I thought, 'My 
God, it's the Riviera up on the cliffs!' " said Alice Wiesel, editor of the 
Illinois-based Mobil Travel Guide, a national consumer guide with an estimated 
1.5 million readers. 
</P>
<P>
"The service really sets it apart and, of course, the location on the ocean. 
There really isn't anything else like it on either coast of the United States." 
</P>
<P>
Up the circular drive to the fountain with marble dolphins, the Ritz-Carlton 
entrance is low-key. A variety of uniformed employees park the car, load the 
luggage and escort you indoors. Check-in is at 3 p.m. There is no wait. 
</P>
<P>
The lobby is understated opulence. Marble floors inlaid with brilliant rugs. 
Leather chairs to die for. Dark wood furnishings, 19th-Century art. This is 
about the time the pinky finger involuntarily extends. 
</P>
<P>
The bellman, Rick, wearing a tan designer uniform and cap and white gloves, 
says "Good afternoon, ma'am (or sir)." Like all 850 employees of this hotel, he 
has been trained never to simply say "Hi!" or call guests "folks." It's either 
too presumptuous or too condescending. Pedestrian responses such as "OK" and 
"uh-huh" are shunned in favor of "certainly" and "my pleasure." 
</P>
<P>
Nightly rates for the 393 rooms range from $185 to $2,000 for the Presidential 
Suite. Prices are based on vista. Unless you like parking lots or views that 
"may be obstructed by a tree," Ritz publicist Linda Adams says, the cheapest 
rooms have no view. For $260 your "courtyard" room affords a view of the garden 
and pool. Another $30 a night buys you the "coastline" room, with a partial 
view of the ocean. For $360 you get a panoramic view of the sea through the 
French doors opening on to your balcony. 
</P>
<P>
Those seeking even more exclusivity might opt for the fourth-floor Ritz-Carlton 
Club, popular with executives and celebrities. Depending on how much you eat 
and drink, this could be considered a bargain. It costs $45 to $85 extra, 
depending on your room, but you can eat and drink around the clock for no 
additional charge. 
</P>
<P>
In a cozy parlor with a veranda overlooking the waves, three concierges attend 
to the Club-level guests only, making dinner reservations and calling ahead for 
their cars. They keep stocked the open bar and the silver urns of coffee and 
hot water for English tea. Pastries and cereal and juices are spread across the 
antique chests in the morning; mixed fruits and cold cuts and sourdough bread 
and cheeses and scones arrive around noon; finger sandwiches go with afternoon 
tea; desserts are offered in the evening. And champagne is available all day 
long. 
</P>
<P>
The hotel elevator only goes to the Club level with a fourth-floor room key, 
thereby keeping out the traffic -- and perhaps overzealous fans. 
</P>
<P>
As soon as the elevator doors shut, Rick begins explaining hotel-like things. 
His guest looks bored and interrupts him. So is Bruce Springsteen staying on 
this floor? Rick grins and says he doesn't think so. He is polite enough not to 
roll his eyes. 
</P>
<P>
Like most of the staff, he is engaging but speaks mostly when spoken to. He 
admits singer Janet Jackson and her sisters visited this floor the other week. 
As he unlocks the door, he does offer that Michael Jackson put a dance floor 
and sound system in this room to practice before concerts when he last toured. 
He stayed in the Presidential Suite two doors down. 
</P>
<P>
The room, like many, is decorated in "sea foam" blues and grays. The white 
antiqued wood and rattan furnishings are a cross between French Provincial and 
French Polynesian that works. The bathroom is marble, the white Ritz towels 
plush. There is a phone beside the commode with a redial button. There are 
complimentary toiletries but no sewing kit. Instead there is hotel seamstress 
Lolan Tsang for repairs. 
</P>
<P>
Even though it is at the beach, the Ritz-Carlton imposes a dress code. Oh, 
sure, it's discreetly announced post-arrival by way of a "guest attire" 
brochure on the nightstand. But though the management is rumored to be relaxing 
some on this, bellmen and waitresses have been known to point it out to guests. 
</P>
<P>
One guest reported that he was ever-so-politely refused service one morning by 
a waiter in the Cafe, the most casual restaurant. He was wearing green corduroy 
shorts and a golf shirt. "Does the gentleman have a jacket?" the waiter asked. 
The gentleman didn't. He also didn't want to wear one provided by the hotel, he 
said, even if it did match his shorts. 
</P>
<P>
Guidelines are offered for each public room. Denims are permitted, during the 
daytime and only in one restaurant. Guests are asked to wear Ritz-Carlton terry 
cloth robes en route to the pool. Children are not spared. Even outside 
contractors must wear collared shirts. But listen, tennis shoes are allowed. 
And if you forgot yours, you can rent a pair here! 
</P>
<P>
Ritz managers say they are somewhat torn about the dress code, but many of 
their guests, particularly Europeans, demand it. 
</P>
<P>
"Let's face it," said an amused Philip Sellick, the hotel's landscape director 
and just about the most casually dressed employee in the place, "formal wear in 
California is putting socks on." 
</P>
<P>
After unpacking the luggage and watching that in-house video to find your 
bearings, it's time to check out the sunset. This, many guests will tell you, 
is the most alluring feature of the Ritz-Carlton. From your balcony or the 
beach, or from almost any ocean-facing hallway in the hotel, you can watch the 
sun drop beneath the horizon, and it is spectacular. 
</P>
<P>
Some people fancy the hotel's daily afternoon tea, served from 2:30 to 5 in the 
Library. Here, the surroundings are almost museum-like: 19th-Century nautical 
paintings, an antique carved ship, overstuffed sofas, and shelves stocked with 
leather-bound books, like Caruthers' "History of a Lawsuit" and an 1883 edition 
of Chambers Journal of Popular Literature, Science and Arts. 
</P>
<P>
The Lounge next door is like a long formal living room, with marble planters 
and striped cozy sofas. It's comfortable, has a terrific view and is still in 
range of the piano player performing "Nobody Does It Better." 
</P>
<P>
As the sun faded down the sky, a frosted blond woman from Texas is talking 
rather indiscreetly with a group of men about her ex-daughter-in-law, who has 
just departed for the restroom. 
</P>
<P>
"I love my ex-daughter-in-law. You know, she wants to get married. She really 
does. She goes to a lot of places but she meets the wrong men. She wants to be 
totally in love, totally happy. And you know, nothing's totally happy." 
</P>
<P>
She ordered another drink as "People Who Need People" played on the ivories, 
then picked up her train of thought. "She wants a house overlooking the ocean 
with waves crashing on the beach, but when do you ever have all your dreams 
come true? Except at this place, eh?" 
</P>
<P>
Hotelier Leona Helmsley, the embattled queen of New York's towering Helmsley 
Palace who is awaiting sentencing on a tax-evasion conviction, stayed in a 
Ritz-Carlton suite a few months ago, according to general manager Henry E. 
Schielein. Helmsley declined to return phone calls, but Schielein proudly notes 
that she deemed it smashing and "very peaceful." 
</P>
<P>
Other guests have included former U.S. Presidents Richard M. Nixon, Gerald 
Ford, Jimmy Carter and Ronald Reagan; the Crown Prince of Saudi Arabia and Don 
Cornelius of "Soul Train" dance show fame, Ambassador and Mrs. Walter Annenberg 
and Malcolm Forbes. 
</P>
<P>
Although hotels catering to the rich and reclusive can't keep high-profile 
guests without a low profile, some 235 people evidently permitted the 
Ritz-Carlton to reveal their past visits in a "Who's Who" list. 
</P>
<P>
Nevertheless, hotel managers are ever-so-gracious when they decline to discuss 
juicy details. 
</P>
<P>
Occasionally, one hears a stray rumor. 
</P>
<P>
A local builder awaiting completion of his custom home spent $180,000 in room 
rent alone for a nine-month stay at the Ritz-Carlton. Bellmen recall how his 
children skateboarded down the elegant driveway to school each day. 
</P>
<P>
Bob Dylan checked in as Mickey McGillicuddy. Michael Jackson rented the 
$2,000-a-night Presidential Suite and two adjoining rooms, then moved in a 
dance floor and sound equipment to warm up for his concert tour each day. 
Barbra Streisand, whose disguise left her looking like a Shiite Muslim, stayed 
a week before anyone knew she was there. Robin Leach, host of "Lifestyles of 
the Rich and Famous," bared his backside for charity at the Ritz in June before 
a crowd of entertainment types that included Robert Wagner and Frankie Avalon. 
</P>
<P>
About half of those who stay at the hotel are business travelers, and 15% of 
them are from foreign companies. The other half of the guest roster comes from 
Southern California -- vacationers from Los Angeles, Beverly Hills, Bel-Air. 
They are often celebrating their birthdays or anniversaries or some other 
special occasion. 
</P>
<P>
Catering to the unusual desires of the rich is something for which the 
Ritz-Carlton is more famous. At the chain's Boston mother ship, Carol Channing 
had a kitchen installed in her suite and another woman had her entire room 
redecorated and repainted pink. In Dana Point, a couple with several children 
had a door put into a wall -- price tag $3,000 -- so the family could move 
freely between rooms. 
</P>
<P>
"You expect that at a hotel like this," Schielein said. "People pay hundreds of 
dollars for wine, and they don't blink an eye. But they are coming to a place 
where they expect those things to be available." 
</P>
<P>
The conversation is interrupted when Schielein stops a busboy loading 
silverware onto a stainless steel tray. The exchange underscores his attention 
to detail, a quality that travel guide editor Wiesel points to as an essential 
key to the hotel's success. Wiesel claims to have spotted the general manager 
at 10 one night, straightening paintings in the lobby. 
</P>
<P>
"Put a napkin on it and you won't make so much noise," Schielein instructed. 
The busboy did. "Good! Makes sense, eh? Thank you!" The busboy grinned. 
</P>
<P>
"So," Schielein continues, "how many restaurants can you go into where you can 
buy a bottle of wine that's over 100 years old?" He laughs with gusto. "After 
all, you can't take it with you!" 
</P>
<P>
The one thing the Ritz-Carlton has that no other chain seems to offer is a 
smoking den. It was Schielein's brainchild. 
</P>
<P>
Schielein -- who made his marriage proposal 25 years ago based on his right to 
smoke cigars without complaint -- introduced the smokers' lair at the original 
Ritz-Carlton in Boston, where he worked before coming to the chain's Dana Point 
resort in 1986. It occurred to him one day, as he lit up one of his beloved 
Partagas and a woman winced, that there was no place in the hotel he could 
comfortably puff away. Six months ago he opened the Dana Point hotel's Library 
to cigar and pipe smokers, and it has been written about in the New York Times, 
Playboy magazine and -- surprise -- tobacco giant Philip Morris Co.'s magazine. 
</P>
<P>
The cheapest Port served is $6 a glass, the most expensive $145. "This stuff is 
as old as my mother," one guest noted. 
</P>
<P>
Although tea is served in daytime hours, this room is very manly. Pasadena 
Weekly publisher Jim Laris captured it this way: 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
 . . . A beautiful cigartress, Angela, came over and offered us cigars from the 
Ritz-Carlton private stock, and we settled for two $9.80 Zino Veritas. (We 
would have felt guilty but the starving children in India don't smoke anyway.) 
And we lit those beauties with those long Macanudo matches that come in a rich 
black-and-gold triangle-shaped box. And we could hear "Ebb Tide" being played 
at the piano bar across the lobby and the lights sparkled and the ocean waves 
tumbled on the beach. And we settled back and talked about important things 
like truth and God and love and girls in tight-fitting jeans and whether or not 
Lite beer Tastes Great or is Less Filling. And we just smoked and talked and 
talked and smoked. And those cigars lasted about an hour and 45 minutes. Which 
we decided came damn close to how long we were happily married. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
 Finally it was time to leave the Library. And we walked out and got on the 
elevator and a rather elderly lady with light blue hair and terminal rouge 
said, "PeeYew. My first husband died from cancer of the whole body because he 
smoked what you guys smell like." 
</P>
<P>
 And Ron turned to me and said, "You know, it doesn't get any better than 
this." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Dinner time rolls around and, it is to be hoped, you took advantage of the 
unlimited-drinks-for-$65-a-night Club deal upstairs. Because supper in the 
Dining Room is going to cost you. This is little food on big plates. Five 
half-dollar-size lamb noisettes and potatoes the shape of rabbit's feet. 
</P>
<P>
It's tasty and the service is china. The walls are the color of salmon, the 
lighting soft and low and flattering to the skin. Two servers are assigned to 
each table. The "back-waiter" never speaks. Drinking water is bottled Vittel. 
The lobster bisque, well, they do this thing where the bowl arrives to your 
table with two little bites in it, artfully arranged. Then they ladle the stuff 
in. It's all very decadent and yummy, and one might even pick up tips from a 
waiter on how to sneak into the pool without checking in. Next trip. 
</P>
<P>
All raves about the Ritz-Carlton invariably hark back to the gracious employees 
-- "ladies and gentlemen serving ladies and gentlemen," as the corporate motto 
goes. There are two employees for every hotel room -- or an average of one per 
guest. That's more than twice the national average, and it shows. 
</P>
<P>
Keeping the hotel's 850 workers happy is fundamental, and it goes beyond wages, 
said Owen E. Dorsey, vice president of human resources for the Georgia-based 
Ritz-Carlton Hotel Co. Employees have to feel good about themselves, have 
self-esteem, he said. Part of that comes in the cachet of working for one of 
the country's best resorts. Part of it comes from the yearly awards bash held 
two weeks ago that was likened by some workers to the Academy Awards. 
</P>
<P>
Here, at the dinner-dance held in the hotel's most sumptuous ballroom, 
dishwashers and maids arrive in tuxedos and chiffon and boogie with management, 
puffing away on cigars beside the big boss himself. After a full-course lobster 
and filet mignon dinner, five awards to the five-star employees of the year are 
announced: round-trip, weeklong trips for two to any Ritz-Carlton in America, 
plus $500 in spending money. The banquet is a wild, employees-only party for 
500 people. Those employees who had to work it get their own banquet later. 
</P>
<P>
And you wonder why the two guys the next morning, dressed in white golf shirts, 
backs bent over to pick up leaves along the hotel driveway, raise upright to 
wave goodby. They amble nearer the departing car, their trash bags in tow. 
"Have a safe trip!" 
</P>
