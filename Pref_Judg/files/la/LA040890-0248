THE GUNS BOOM THEIR salute in the morning haze, echoing from the hills. Down on 
the parade ground, the cadets stand stiffly in the stifling heat, 146 
ramrod-straight youths wearing heavy gray wool tunics and red-plumed hats 
copied from West Point. It is graduation weekend at the Philippine Military 
Academy, in the mountains five hours north of Manila, and President Corazon C. 
Aquino is coming to call. 
</P>
<P>
Three years ago, a bomb exploded in the reviewing stand before Aquino arrived, 
killing four people. This year, the military is taking no chances. Soldiers 
search for car bombs, jeepswith .50-caliber machine guns guard the gates, and 
scowling sharpshooters in black commando garb peer from rooftops. But 
attendance is low. Several top officers and U.S. Embassy officials, among many 
others, have remained in Manila, nervously awaiting what the morning headlines 
predict will be yet another coup attempt. 
</P>
<P>
It's not an unreasonable fear. In December, rightist rebel soldiers nearly 
toppled Aquino in the sixth and bloodiest coup attempt since she came to power 
in 1986. And the military academy is increasingly known as the institution that 
breeds coup plotters -- virtually all of the rebel leaders are graduates. 
Today, signs of dissent are everywhere. On the field, alumni line up by 
classes. None wear uniforms. Instead, members of the Class of '76 sport 
T-shirts emblazoned with "No Witchhunts," a protest of the post-coup-attempt 
arrest of a classmate. Members of the Class of '85, who are handing out 
leaflets demanding "National Discipline," wear semi-Fascist fashion: black 
shirts with khaki suits. That, too, seems appropriate. If they win, rebel 
leaders have said, their military junta will close all but one newspaper, one 
radio station and one TV station. The rebels also promise "a thorough cleansing 
of Philippine society." Most assume that means they will execute opponents. 
</P>
<P>
"Some of our class fought for the rebels, some for the government," Lt. Jun 
Kintanar, 26, president of the Class of '85, says of the December uprising. 
"Maybe we're just disillusioned. We see no purpose or direction. We see the 
need for reform. We need a strong leader. The question in our country is not do 
we want a democracy, but are we prepared for democracy? A lot of people abuse 
it. Or use it as a cloak for graft and corruption. The soldier must inculcate 
in his mind that the cause he's fighting for is worth dying for. The problem 
now is, the only cause is politics." 
</P>
<P>
Democracy is still new to the Philippines. It's only been four years since 
Aquino was swept into office by what has become known as the "people power 
revolution," a historic crusade that brought more than a million Filipinos into 
Manila's streets to end the despotic 20-year regime of President Ferdinand E. 
Marcos. Hailed as a secular Virgin Mary in this staunchly Roman Catholic 
country, she was the courageous widow and unassuming former housewife who won 
the world's heart as a symbol of nonviolence and democracy. In her words, the 
"dark night of tyranny" was over. 
</P>
<P>
Today, her successes are undeniable. Under Aquino, the Philippines has ratified 
a new constitution, restored a bicameral congress and elected thousands of 
provincial and local officials. Her administration has created an in dependent 
Supreme Court, rebuilt labor unions and unfettered what may be the world's most 
freewheeling press. Her military helped turn the tide on a 20-year communist 
insurgency. She began to privatize government-owned companies and repay a 
crushing $28-billion foreign debt. Until the last coup attempt, the 
</P>
<P>
economy was recovering steadily, if slowly. The country has a democracy, if a 
struggling one. 
</P>
<P>
But the profound social, economic and political problems that still plague the 
Philippines illustrate the squandered promise and growing predicament of Cory 
Aquino. She appears unable to appease or control a divided military and 
unwilling to crack down on government corruption. Inefficiency is so ingrained 
that tens of millions of dollars in foreign aid remain unspent while most rural 
areas lack even basic government services. And the president remains so devoted 
to her class and clan that she turns a blind eye to allegations of graft and 
nepotism within her own family. 
</P>
<P>
Perhaps most ominous, the devoutly Catholic president has refused to encourage 
any form of population control. An exploding birth rate already eats away at 
economic gains, and the population of 60 million is projected to double by the 
year 2010. 
</P>
<P>
Nearly half the nation already lives in what the World Bank has called 
"absolute poverty," with too little income to satisfy basic needs. In some 
rural areas, up to 80% of preschool children are malnourished. In Manila, 
millions live as squatters, crowded into dismal shanties without running water 
or sewerage. Thousands of others live on an infamous garbage dump called Smokey 
Mountain, picking trash for a living. And an estimated 75,000 street children 
struggle to survive as scavengers, vendors and prostitutes. 
</P>
<P>
What happened? Aquino offers no answers and no excuses as she stands to address 
the cadets during graduation weekend in February. Another coup attempt is 
clearly foremost in her mind. "Let there be no doubt that when freedom is in 
danger, there are, and can be, no fence-sitters and opportunists among your 
ranks," she tells the men. "Never allow your idealism to be desecrated by those 
whose only desire is to grab power for selfish ends." 
</P>
<P>
Previous graduates, she says, gave their lives for democracy. They are "true 
heroes of the republic." She invokes the names of two men who were killed by 
communist rebels: Lt. Felix Brawner and Lt. Edgardo Dizon. It's a curious 
choice. Brawner's father, a retired general, has been charged in the latest 
coup attempt. And Dizon died in one of the most shameful episodes of Aquino's 
tenure. 
</P>
<P>
It's called the Lupao massacre. 
</P>
<P>
LUPAO IS 90 MILES northeast of Manila, on the edge of the Caraballo Mountains 
in Nueva Ecija province. About 30,000 people live there, mostly tenant farmers 
eking out a living from dusty rice terraces in tiny villages. There is no 
irrigation, so most survive on one meager crop per year, giving a third of it 
to absentee landlords. Many eat but one meal a day. They collect wood from 
nearly denuded hillsides in the long, lean months. It is like countless other 
rural Philippine communities. 
</P>
<P>
Edgardo Dizon had just graduated from the Philippine Military Academy when he 
led 23 men, Alpha Company, of the 14th Infantry Battalion into one of Lupao's 
hamlets early on the morning of Feb. 10, 1987. Unknown to them, about two dozen 
communist commandos had taken over the cluster of bamboo-and-thatch huts the 
night before. Gunfire broke out as Dizon crossed a small bridge. He fell dead, 
shot in the head. 
</P>
<P>
According to the President's Commission on Human Rights, which investigated the 
incident, Dizon's troops responded with a murderous two-hour frenzy. By the 
time the rampage was over, 17 villagers had been slaughtered, including a 
married couple in their 80s and six children younger than 12. A woman four 
months pregnant was shot four times in the back. The communist rebels escaped. 
</P>
<P>
The survivors' testimony is painful to read. Though Ernesto Carnate pleaded, 
"Stop shooting. We're all civilians," a soldier stabbed him in the chest. His 
daughter, Marilyn, watched in horror from a nearby hut. When a neighbor ran out 
with her 5-year-old brother, a soldier shot them both. 
</P>
<P>
The soldiers then executed the elderly couple and a 4-year-old girl under a 
mango tree. Another group, including a 3-year-old boy, was found cowering in a 
rice paddy and was herded into a hut. They were shot from behind, most of them 
in the head. The soldiers then fired grenades into the huts, burning them so 
badly that the bodies inside were unidentifiable. Before leaving, the soldiers 
looted remaining huts of money, radios and clothes. 
</P>
<P>
Early in the investigation, the military claimed that 11 commandos were killed 
in a fire fight. Later, as the truth leaked out, soldiers said the dead and 
wounded civilians had been caught in the cross fire. Both the human rights 
commission and the military provost marshal general rejected that explanation. 
If Carnate was killed in cross fire, why did he suffer stab wounds? And why 
were seven charred bodies found huddled together, shot in the head and back? 
</P>
<P>
The provost called it a cover-up. After the initial killing, the soldiers 
"decided to kill everybody else so as to eliminate witnesses," his report said. 
"In order to hide this heinous crime, they further burned the houses . . . 
unknowing that there were survivors to tell the tale." 
</P>
<P>
Aquino flew to the village 10 days after the massacre to appeal to the grieving 
widows and orphans. "I want to talk to you personally and hear from your lips 
what really happened here," she said, her voice choked with emotion. "Help me. 
I hope you will trust me. Tell me what you know." 
</P>
<P>
Shortly thereafter, 20 soldiers were charged with murder. In a 17-month 
court-martial, six survivors identified four members of Alpha Company as having 
led the massacre. But last May, after both prosecution and defense had rested 
their cases, three of the accused soldiers -- including two identified by 
witnesses -- suddenly asked to take the stand. 
</P>
<P>
They testified that four other soldiers, who had come as reinforcements and had 
not been charged, had committed the atrocities. They gave no evidence, and 
their statements contradicted all previous testimony by the survivors and other 
soldiers. But on July 13, the six-member military tribunal met behind closed 
doors and unanimously acquitted the 20 soldiers of all charges. The witnesses' 
identification of the killers, the court said, was "inherently unprovable" and 
"against the natural course of things." The four other soldiers were never 
arrested. 
</P>
<P>
Sitting behind the desk in his simple, second-floor office, Lupao's middle-aged 
mayor, George M. Castaneda, says the military paid families about $200 in 
restitution for each victim. His voice rises in anger. "It was a whitewash. The 
practice of the military -- they cover up all their mistakes. They tolerate 
wrongdoing. Once a soldier does something wrong, they just transfer him to 
somewhere else as punishment. Here, when there's a robber, one thing's for 
sure: He is a military man or an ex-military man." 
</P>
<P>
Edwin D. S. Limos, a lawyer who represented the victims, walks into Castaneda's 
office. He is 33, is soft-spoken and wears aviator glasses. A University of the 
Philippines graduate, he moved to Lupao from Manila to take the case and 
decided to stay. He says the verdict, which is not subject to appeal, haunts 
him. "I have total disbelief. I am totally frustrated." 
</P>
<P>
Later in the day, Limos leads the way to the site of the slaughter, half a mile 
or so from the town hall. The killing field is abandoned now except for three 
caribou grazing amid tall weeds and broken concrete. A small wooden cross is 
planted near the tree where the elderly couple and young girl were shot. Why 
would soldiers kill civilians? "Maybe because their leader was killed," Limos 
says. "Or maybe because they came from the south, where it is very tough. 
Fighting, looting, killing and salvaging (torture) are normal there. They were 
used to doing anything they want." 
</P>
<P>
Limos heads across dusty brown fields to check on several survivors. He stops 
at a two-room hut with an earthen floor on the edge of a rice paddy. Marissa 
Gante lives here now with another family. She was 6 when her right hand was 
shot off and six members of her family were shot to death. She is 9 now but 
still in first grade. "The other children teased her," Limos explains. Marissa 
says nothing, hiding the stub of her arm in her lap. Another survivor, Rick 
Orentzia, 27, whose mother was killed, sits nearby but refuses to answer 
questions. "Witnesses were threatened," Limos says, shaking his head. 
</P>
<P>
Soon Marilyn Carnate, the girl who saw her father stabbed and 5-year-old 
brother shot, arrives. Now 17, she has one infant and is pregnant again beneath 
a torn cotton dress. "There was no justice," she says bitterly. "I testified at 
the trial. Those men should have been sent to jail." She says Aquino had 
promised justice when she visited Lupao. "What happened to her promise? She 
hasn't fulfilled her promise yet." 
</P>
<P>
THE PROMISE STARTED at EDSA, which is an acronym for the eight-lane Manila road 
where giant crowds massed for four days in February, 1986, to link arms, recite 
the rosary, block Marcos' tanks and throw the hated dictator out. A huge statue 
of the Virgin Mary now looms over the intersection where "people power" 
prevailed. It is Sunday, Feb. 25, and Aquino stands behind bulletproof glass at 
the shrine to address the fourth-anniversary celebration of what is always 
referred to in the Philippines simply as EDSA. The crowd of 30,000 is the 
smallest ever. 
</P>
<P>
In the morning, she launched the celebration down the street by raising a flag 
outside Camp Aguinaldo and Camp Crame, the two military garrisons where the 
1986 revolt began. Before she arrived, an aide checked the honor guards' rifles 
to ensure that none was loaded. This afternoon, three Army helicopters clatter 
noisily back and forth over the crowd, dumping thousands of leaflets that extol 
the 1986 uprising. Since yellow has come to symbolize Aquino's quixotic 
campaign, many in the crowd wear yellow hats and T-shirts or wave yellow 
pennants and balloons bearing her picture. Brass bands blare and march about, 
while hundreds of nuns and priests quietly wait for a Mass to begin. A plane 
overhead trails a banner advertising "Peace, Justice and Freedom." 
</P>
<P>
People are cheerful, singing patriotic songs and munching boiled corn and 
peanuts. Many of them say they are government employees, encouraged by their 
department heads to attend. This is a middle-class crowd, still the core of 
Aquino's support despite daily battles with rising prices, chaotic public 
transit, water shortages and blackouts. The last coup attempt scared many back 
into Aquino's camp, primarily because they believe a military junta would be 
worse. "We have no alternative," explains Francisco Vegas, a 34-year-old 
railway worker. "It's been disappointing. But with Cory, we have hope. With 
Marcos, we were hopeless." 
</P>
<P>
A leftist group holds a much-used banner emblazoned with "No to U.S. Military 
Bases, No to U.S. Intervention." Carol Almeda, a 30-year-old government 
researcher, says she heads an anti-government group with 100,000 government 
employees as members. "We came to reach out to the Philippine masses," she 
explains. As people gather around her, she lists a long series of grievances 
and demands, ending with a call to nationalize "the oil and steel industry." 
What steel industry? "Actually, there is no steel industry," she concedes. 
"It's the principle that's important." 
</P>
<P>
Similar leftist groups have led an upsurge in anti-American feelings in the 
Philippines. Most of the anger is directed at upcoming talks to renegotiate 
leases for six U.S. military facilities. Six Americans associated with the 
military have been slain since 1987, presumably by communist guerrillas. As a 
result, U.S. troops are warned not to wear uniforms off base lest they become 
targets, while key embassy aides use new armor-plated cars. Still, I feel far 
safer than in New York. Last fall, when chanting student demonstrators burned a 
tattered U.S. flag at a Manila rally, two of the most strident rushed over to 
apologize when embers blew on my shirt. They were the politest protesters I had 
ever met. 
</P>
<P>
In one corner of the crowd, Andrew Casino, a 23-year-old law student, is trying 
to cash in on the attempted coup. He sells $4 T-shirts marked with a picture of 
a tank and the words, "I survived the 1989 coup d'etat in Manila." He says he 
has grossed $2,000 since December. He adds that he saved the silk screen in 
case he needs a 1990 version. 
</P>
<P>
His brother, Paul Stephen R. Casino, 24, is assistant to the undersecretary of 
the Department of Trade and Industry. "After 20 years of Marcos, we didn't know 
what was going to happen when he left," says Paul, who is wearing one of 
Andrew's T-shirts. "Things have improved a little bit. Not as much as people 
expected in 1986. 
</P>
<P>
That's why people are disappointed. They cannot gauge the improvements. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm not disappointed with Cory," he continues. "I'm disappointed with the 
government. They're like a bunch of clowns. It's not her fault. It's the 
problem with the Filipinos. You know what crabs are? When you put a bunch in a 
pail, and one climbs up, the others pull him down. Filipinos are like that. We 
pull each other down." 
</P>
<P>
Deeper in the crowd, George Guevara, 41, stands for the Mass with his wife, 
Marjorie. They have seven children, and he commutes two hours each way to his 
job as a telephone cable splicer. "It's tough," he says. "I have to stand in 
line and fight my way onto crowded jeepneys," the gaudily painted, elongated 
jeeps used for public transportation in the Philippines. 
</P>
<P>
But Guevara hasn't lost faith in Aquino. "It's much better now," he says. 
Collective bargaining gave him a $75-a-month raise on top of his salary of 
about $500 a month, far more than he received under Marcos and 10 times the 
average Filipino's income. "I don't think it's fair to blame the president for 
the country's problems," he says. "And the coup leaders just want power. That's 
all. For me, I'm satisfied." 
</P>
<P>
As the sun sets, Aquino is on stage listing schools erected, houses built, 
wells dug, irrigation systems started. "Confidence is coming back," she tells 
the crowd. Then comes a blistering attack on her political nemesis, Sen. Juan 
Ponce Enrile. The two have feuded publicly ever since she fired him as defense 
chief in November, 1986, after his aides tried to launch a coup. Today, 
speaking in coarse Tagalog, Aquino mocks Enrile by name 17 times. "Be a man," 
she tells him, "or better yet, be a woman." 
</P>
<P>
Finally, she turns her contempt on her other chief critic, vice president and 
opposition leader Salvador (Doy) Laurel. "Do we have to talk about the fly 
anymore?" she says, dismissing him. The crowd laughs. 
</P>
<P>
A REAL FLY IS BUZZING at Aquino. It has invaded the heavily guarded Malacanang 
Palace Guest House, has flown upstairs and is divebombing the president of the 
Republic of the Philippines as she gives an interview. Sitting on a beige 
couch, she tries again and again to brush it away, then glares at half a dozen 
aides. One of them finally appears with a red fly swatter. He whacks the 
Philippine flag behind her, then smacks the wall near the presidential seal. 
Finally, he drops to his knees to extricate the dead insect from the deep, 
yellow-gold carpet. 
</P>
<P>
Aquino has had somewhat better luck swatting Enrile. Three days earlier, 
government agents had arrested him on charges of supporting the December coup 
attempt. The irony is delicious: As Marcos' martial law administrator in the 
1970s, Enrile jailed Aquino's late husband, Sen. Benigno (Ninoy) Aquino Jr., 
and thousands of others. Unlike Ninoy, who was held incommunicado for weeks 
after his arrest and served eight years in jail, Enrile conducted numerous 
press conferences during his incarceration (he was released on bail after a 
week). At one point, flanked by a mob of reporters and cameras, he complained, 
"I am cut off from the outside world." His "cell" was an air-conditioned 
two-room police office, complete with phones, an exercise bike, crates of fruit 
juice and his own bed and maid from home. 
</P>
<P>
"That is all right," the president says mildly, when asked about Enrile's 
gilded cage. "My goodness, this is a free country. And let him have access to 
the press." 
</P>
<P>
Aquino relaxes when asked if expectations were too high after 1986. Of course, 
she says, because the four-day "people power" revolt appeared so sudden and 
simple. But it wasn't. Opposition leaders worked hard for years. And, no, her 
own expectations were not too high. Before her husband was assassinated in 
1983, he had warned her. 
</P>
<P>
"He said that he felt sorry for whoever would come after Marcos because, given 
the many problems Marcos will leave behind, he would not be at all surprised if 
after six months in office, Marcos' successor will be booted out of office. So 
I knew what was in store for me. 
</P>
<P>
"I would have wanted it easier, of course," she continues. "My goodness, I am 
not a masochist. . . . And certainly I can look back to many accomplishments 
during my four years." 
</P>
<P>
Aquino ticks off the economic gains. Back in 1984-85, inflation rocketed to 
40%, factories closed, unemployment zoomed. "Before I took over, there was a 
feeling of hopelessness and helplessness," she adds. "Casting modesty aside, I 
was able to bring back hope." She has helped lower the percentage of the 
population living below the poverty line from 59% to 49%, she says, and is now 
aiming government programs at the bottom third of income earners. Another 
program will help small businesses and make credit more readily available to 
farmers' co-ops. "Hopefully, for the last two years of my term, we will be able 
not only to duplicate what we have done in the last four years but maybe do 
even more." 
</P>
<P>
Still, she says she's disillusioned. The last two coup attempts, the bloodiest 
and most disruptive, have "derailed" the gains. Her mistake, she says, was 
"trusting too much. Or being too patient insofar as my enemies are concerned." 
They took advantage of her. "I really set out on a program of reconciliation. 
And certainly I tried my best." There was the truce with communist rebels that 
collapsed in 1987 and the endless attempts to appease right-wing military 
officers who continue to try to overthrow her. 
</P>
<P>
"At a certain point, you realize there are some people who just don't want to 
be reconciled," she says emphatically. "But I really believe that I have bent 
over backward to enlist the support of as many of our people as possible." 
</P>
<P>
The president wears a polka-dot beige dress (an aide says she now wears yellow 
only when she must; she prefers bright pink), simple pearl earrings and black 
pumps. She's 57 now, and her face is broader, framed by wide, silver-rim 
glasses and a new hairstyle, cropped close around the ears. She is warm and 
smiles easily. But she flashes in anger when asked if any members of her family 
have transgressed her own ethical standards. Five family members sit in 
Congress, and allegations of wrongdoing have dogged her wealthy and powerful 
younger brother, Rep. Jose (Peping) Cojuangco Jr. -- though none of the 
president's clan has been charged with a crime. 
</P>
<P>
"My enemies will try everything and anything," she replies archly. "Even if 
they are not exactly honest in the matter of their criticisms." She cites her 
34-year-old daughter, Maria (Ballsy) Aquino Cruz, who is her personal 
secretary. Enrile has suggested that there was something improper about a 
Japanese businessman's letter, sent in care of the president's secretary, about 
a plan to sell Philippine-owned property in Tokyo. Aquino's answer is vehement; 
aides call it her "mother hen" response. "It's very clear," she says. "It is a 
very deliberate attempt to downgrade me and drag down as many innocent persons 
as possible." 
</P>
<P>
I change the subject to Lupao. Why did she name Lt. Dizon in her military 
academy speech? "The first time that I went to the PMA, he was one of the 
graduates," she says, relaxing again. "And he was the first one who was killed 
after the graduation." 
</P>
<P>
Does she think justice was done in Lupao? 
</P>
<P>
"Yes," she replies. She recalls that she flew to Lupao "to find out directly 
from the residents what actually happened and what it was I could do for them." 
She says she helped them find land closer to town and later obtain title to the 
land. Medical aid and job training were provided. "And," she concludes, "the 
guilty were prosecuted." 
</P>
<P>
But they were all acquitted, I say awkwardly. 
</P>
<P>
"No, I don't think so," she says. Then she pauses. "Let me check on that." She 
glances at her spokesman, Tomas (Buddy) Gomez III. "Buddy, could you check that 
for me?" 
</P>
<P>
I'm quite sure, I say, all the soldiers were acquitted last July. 
</P>
<P>
"We'll check on that," she says stiffly. (Gomez calls two days later to confirm 
the acquittals.) 
</P>
<P>
She disagrees strongly when told that many Filipinos say that only a strong, 
even an authoritarian, leader can solve the nation's problems. Marcos was 
strong, she points out, and he "sank us even faster." The problem has been the 
quick transition from dictatorship to democracy. 
</P>
<P>
"Some people would like the benefits of an authoritarian government," she 
explains. "But at the same time, they would like to live under a democracy. I 
think it's really impossible for the two to go together." 
</P>
<P>
Instead, the Philippines should be seen as a "pilot country" for newly restored 
democracies. Don't "judge my leadership," Aquino says, until it can be compared 
to other fledgling democracies in Eastern Europe and to Nicaragua. "Certainly, 
I hope they would have it easier," she adds with a smile. "We do not want to 
wish the many problems that I've had on my counterparts." 
</P>
<P>
AQUINO'S "pilot country" is in serious trouble. A form of democratic anarchy 
prevails, and the ideals that brought her to power have faded. Sadly, her best 
hope of surviving may be the growing fear that what comes next may be much 
worse. 
</P>
<P>
One need only visit the Malacanang Palace museum, where Marcos memorabilia is 
kept, to be reminded of what came before Aquino. Here are her predecessor's 
diapers and 4-inch platform shoes. And Imelda Marcos' 6,900 dresses and 1,220 
pairs of shoes (including a set of disco pumps with battery-powered flashing 
lights in the heels). There are two paintings of Imelda as Mona Lisa and one of 
an ethereal Imelda on the half-shell, grotesquely copied from Botticelli's 
"Birth of Venus." It is a testimonial to both bad government and bad taste. 
</P>
<P>
It's unfair to blame Aquino for all her nation's woes, says Cardinal Jaime Sin, 
who sent nuns and priests to the streets to help oust Marcos in 1986. Marcos 
left behind an empty treasury, a bloated bureaucracy, a politicized military 
and institutional corruption. "We were able to expel Ali Baba," Sin says. "But 
the 40 thieves stayed. And now maybe there are only 20 thieves. So the 
situation has improved." 
</P>
<P>
But the improvements are often hard to see. Courts remain impossibly clogged, 
and judges are notoriously corrupt. Congress is more an obstacle than a 
catalyst for change. Alex Magno, a political scientist at the University of the 
Philippines, estimates that 30,000 bills now languish in Congress. "The 
legislative process is overloaded with meaningless legislation," he says. "A 
congressman wants to name a rural school after his father, and an opponent from 
a rival clan objects. So there are hearings and debates and testimony. And real 
change is put on endless delay." 
</P>
<P>
Blas Ople, a framer of the constitution and a member of the opposition 
Nacionalista Party, argues that the president must shoulder most of the 
responsibility. "She has a majority in both houses, but it's a meaningless 
majority," he says. "Every congressman and senator has his own agenda. And 
Aquino does not feel it necessary, well into her fourth year, to put together 
or submit any kind of legislative agenda. As a result, Congress is in a state 
of perpetual anarchy." 
</P>
<P>
Jovita Salonga, the Senate president, insists that Congress only follows 
Aquino's lead. He blames "towering expectations" after 1986. "People thought, 
with freedom and democracy, graft and corruption would be rooted out, poverty 
would be eased, squatters would be housed. These were unreasonable 
expectations. But there were legitimate expectations that there would be 
greater efficiency in government, that graft and corruption would be 
substantially reduced and that there would be a higher moral tone in 
government. In these areas, where Cory should be strong, there is instead a 
sense of drift. There is a widespread perception that we have lost our 
mission." 
</P>
<P>
It's hard to find a vision or a sense of urgency in Aquino. As one of her 
former supporters in the military says, "She floats above all the problems." 
Most important, as in Lupao, she has little follow-through. In a hard-hitting 
speech in October, 1987, after the fifth failed coup attempt, Aquino complained 
that "it seems clear I must do nearly everything myself." She created a new 
"Action Committee, with a single member -- me." She sternly ordered officials 
to pick up Manila's garbage, fill in potholes, stop power shortages, improve 
telephone service and more. All in one week. Nothing happened. Manila's streets 
today are strewn with rotting garbage, axle-breaking potholes abound, the 
electricity fails regularly and telephone service takes months to install or 
repair.

"Nobody's afraid of Cory," explains Tony Gatmaitan, a Manila businessman and 
economist. "That's her problem. Like most people, we Filipinos are like school 
kids. Since Cory came in, we've been on perpetual recess. She doesn't raise her 
voice, she doesn't slap our wrists, she doesn't stop us from running in and out 
and playing our games. She's powerless. We need an authoritarian figure." 
</P>
<P>
Part of the nation's plight is historical. More than 300 years as a Spanish 
colony left a feudal plantation economy, with an elite handful of landowners 
ruling impoverished rural peasants and governing by patronage and bribery. 
Another 50 years as a U.S. colony, until World War II, only reinforced the 
brutal land-tenure system and widened the gap between rich and poor. Marcos, 
first elected in 1965, merely replaced the old aristocracy with his own 
even-greedier friends. 
</P>
<P>
Thus, Aquino promised that land reform, the key to solving rural poverty, would 
be the "centerpiece" of her administration. Instead, it has become an 
embarrassment. Rather than using her popularity to decree reform after she won 
office in 1986, she handed responsibility to the landlord-dominated Congress. 
The results were predictable: Barely 5% of available land has changed hands or 
title under the current loophole-riddled law. 
</P>
<P>
And the president's commitment stopped short at the heavily guarded borders of 
her family's 15,250-acre Hacienda Luisita sugar-cane plantation in central 
Luzon. The Cojuangco family used a loophole to give shares of stock, instead of 
land, to Hacienda Luisita's 7,000 workers. The family argued that breaking up 
the highly successful plantation -- which includes its own 18-hole golf course 
-- would only deprive workers of schools, clinics and other benefits. Polls 
showed that most of Hacienda Luisita's workers agreed. But critics called it a 
mockery of land reform. 
</P>
<P>
"Land reform was important precisely because she was landed," says Randy David, 
another political scientist at the University of the Philippines. "And I 
believe the Hacienda Luisita property would have made a difference, a great 
difference. It would have symbolized sincerity, compassion for the poor and a 
willingness to put national interests above traditional family ties. Instead, 
Hacienda Luisita became the best example of a callous and well-crafted evasion 
of the spirit of the law. So what do you expect other landlords to do? Instead 
of distributing land, they are distributing paper shares of stock in companies 
they (the workers) can never hope to control in any meaningful sense." 
</P>
<P>
In many ways, the 1986 "revolution" was actually a restoration of the powerful 
oligarchs, family dynasties and political bosses Marcos had dispossessed. 
Aquino's younger brother, Peping Cojuangco, is usually included on the list. A 
three-term congressman, he's known as a kind of political godfather, a man you 
see to get things done. At his home in Dasmarinas, one of Manila's richest 
suburbs, we sit in a den filled with a fortune in Asian antiquities. He's 55, 
quiet, intense and carefully groomed. He smokes and speaks slowly, particularly 
when asked about the endless allegations against his family. 
</P>
<P>
"It's all been insinuation," he says evenly. "They've actually tried to compare 
our family and the previous family (the Marcoses). There is a very big 
difference. Our family was in a strong position even before Cory became 
president." His brother was a bank president, another sister headed Manila's 
Far Eastern University. He himself was a mayor and two-term congressman in the 
1960s. "So we have had some form of success. We really don't need a president 
in the family to carry on." 
</P>
<P>
Anyway, he adds, feudalism is good for the Philippines. "They criticize us for 
a feudal system," he says. "Maybe someday we can eliminate it. But for the 
moment, the Philippine way of life is based on the family and feudal structure. 
I suppose it's because what every Filipino is looking for is security. And to 
band together behind a strong leader." 
</P>
<P>
ASSUMING NO further coup attempts -- and even Aquino's aides won't rule them 
out -- the Philippines will get its chance to choose a new leader in 1992, when 
democracy promises to run riot. Every elected position will be up for grabs. 
That includes president and vice president, 24 senators, 200 congressmen, 73 
governors and more than 50,000 provincial, local and village officials. 
</P>
<P>
Since Aquino said she won't run again, the early favorite is Defense Secretary 
Fidel V. Ramos, the terse, cigar-chomping West Point graduate who has stood by 
Aquino every time his military has mutinied against her. He is nationally 
respected, but many fear that he cannot control the divided military any better 
as president. House Speaker Ramon V. Mitra, better known for his white beard 
than his legislative leadership, also is angling for Aquino's endorsement. 
</P>
<P>
Vice President Laurel, the in-house critic who welcomed the December coup 
attempt as "democracy in its fullest and complete sense" and called for her 
resignation, wants to run. But his image as a buzzing gadfly draws little 
public support. Nor do many Filipinos back the ever-ambitious Sen. Enrile, who 
announced his candidacy during his short detention. 
</P>
<P>
Most intriguing is businessman Eduardo (Danding) Cojuangco, Aquino's estranged 
cousin. He was the consummate Marcos crony, a stalwart of the deposed dictator 
who recently boasted -- probably accurately -- that his 200 or so companies 
once accounted for 25% of the Philippines' gross national product. He fled with 
Marcos to Hawaii in 1986 and then spent nearly four years in lonely exile in 
Long Beach, Calif. Suddenly, a week before the December uprising, he slipped 
back to Manila. He refuses to say how. 
</P>
<P>
Now, while his lawyers fight a slew of civil and criminal charges against him, 
the burly 54-year-old billionaire travels the country in his private plane, 
laying groundwork for a 1992 presidential bid. It is said that the world's 
richest Filipino is offering million-dollar fees and $50,000 race horses to key 
supporters. His campaign slogan is on pocket calendars: "BOSS: In bad times and 
in good." 
</P>
<P>
The bad times since the last coup attempt have already won Cojuangco converts, 
even among former Aquino loyalists. An Air Force general who remained faithful 
to her through every coup attempt says that he and many of his fellow officers 
have decided to back Cojuangco in 1992. The general says the country needs to 
fill its leadership void. 
</P>
<P>
"Power abhors a vacuum," he says. "She's not using her power, and that's the 
problem. . . . It's impossible to hate her. She's like a mother. But she's no 
president." 
</P>
<P>
He shrugs off Cojuangco's unsavory connections to Marcos. The euphoria of 
"people power" is long gone, he says. "Sometimes we Filipinos have very short 
memories," he explains patiently. "And the 1986 revolution is already fading 
into the mist of memory."
