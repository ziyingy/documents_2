The risk of influenza leading to a fatal case of pneumonia, especially among 
older people, can be significantly decreased by the flu vaccine. 
</P>
<P>
"Prevention is of utmost importance for people over 65, and those with lung 
disease and other illnesses," said Dr. Joseph Lowy, a lung specialist at New 
York University Medical Center. 
</P>
<P>
Everyone in these high-risk groups should get a flu shot before peak flu 
season, which runs from October through March, he urged. 
</P>
<P>
"For young and healthy people, neither flu nor pneumonia are life-threatening," 
Lowy said. "For older, ill and immune-compromised people, pneumonia is a common 
and dangerous complication of flu." 
</P>
<P>
Pneumonia is the most common cause of death from infections and the 
sixth-leading cause of death in the United States. 
</P>
<P>
More than 10,000 people died in each of the 19 flu epidemics from 1957 to 1986. 
In several, the number was as high as 40,000. Nearly 90% of those who died were 
over 65. 
</P>
<P>
The vaccine, made from killed virus, is reformulated every year to make it 
likelier to be effective against that year's prevailing viruses. 
</P>
<P>
There is also a vaccine against pneumococcus, the pneumonia-causing bacteria 
that commonly affect older people. One inoculation gives lifelong protection. 
</P>
<P>
Lowy explained that pneumonia is a general term to describe an infection of the 
lung caused by one of several agents, bacteria and viruses the most common. 
</P>
<P>
The influenza virus can cause viral pneumonia or it can lower a person's 
resistance to subsequent bacterial infection. 
</P>
<P>
Bacteria and viruses are introduced into the lungs constantly, but most people 
can usually fight them off. An older or ill person is less able to clear the 
lungs of microbes. 
</P>
<P>
Lowy recommends that medical attention be sought if these symptoms persist for 
more than a few days.
