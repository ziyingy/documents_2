Back-yard vacations have some real advantages: they don't cost much money and 
they don't take a lot of time. 
</P>
<P>
"We're afraid to spend too much money these days, and we can't go too far 
because of horrendous gas prices," said Martha McDonough, an Escondido 
housewife with three children under the age of 12. 
</P>
<P>
McDonough and her husband, a computer programmer, say the family will take day 
trips during the Christmas holiday. "We'll finally see what's in our own back 
yard," said Jim McDonough. 
</P>
<P>
Community attractions -- such as museums -- are sometimes slow to be discovered 
by the people who live near them. 
</P>
<P>
"Locals take all this for granted," said Guy Woodward, curator of the Guy B. 
Woodward Museum in Ramona. Woodward, 81, is referring to the 
turn-of-the-century museum that carries his name and is considered tops by 
historical societies in the state. "We've been judged twice as the best 
backcountry museum in California." 
</P>
<P>
Up the road a bit is the Julian Pioneer Museum, visited by more than 75,000 
people a year, most from outside the area. "Not a day goes by that we don't see 
somebody from a foreign country," said curator Mabel Carlson. 
</P>
<P>
The typical North County museum differs from the larger, more traditional 
museum where the atmosphere is formal and collections are perfectly arranged, 
enshrined and guarded. Hometown museums are family-oriented, educational and 
lively places that offer something for young and old. 
</P>
<P>
For instance, at the Quail Botanical Gardens in Encinitas, there is a tour for 
3- and 4-year-old children, designed to teach young minds how early man 
survived off the land; the Anza-Borrego Visitor Center in Borrego Springs has 
an audio tape of sounds and conversations recorded during the 1968 Borrego 
earthquake; and at the Antique Gas &amp; Steam Engine Museum in Vista, 
mechanical buffs examine restored, operational farm equipment, such as a 
hillside harvester built in 1917 with gears that cranked manually and required 
a crew of 5 to run. 
</P>
<P>
No rules or regulations govern the formation of a museum, community-based or 
otherwise, although most have nonprofit status and are affiliated with a 
historical society. Some receive support from local, state or federal agencies. 
On a day-to-day basis, they tend to be managed and staffed by dedicated, 
knowledgeable volunteers. 
</P>
<P>
There are a number of good museums in North County that cost little, if 
anything, to enjoy. Most request donations, though. The museums that aren't 
right in your neighborhood are probably within a 60-minute drive from home.

GUY B. WOODWARD MUSEUM 
</P>
<P>
645 Main St., Ramona 
</P>
<P>
(619) 789-7644 
</P>
<P>
Open 1-4 p.m., Thursday through Sunday; closed holidays. 
</P>
<P>
When Guy Woodward and his wife were vacationing in Hawaii some years ago, 
members of the Ramona Historical Society took a vote and changed the name of 
their museum. "Darned if I didn't come home to find they'd named the museum 
after me," said Woodward, who dresses in Western attire, looks every bit the 
cowboy part, and is undoubtedly the perfect volunteer. 
</P>
<P>
Although several wooden structures dot the museum property, the centerpiece is 
a beautifully restored 1886 French Provincial home called the Verlaque house, 
named after its original owner. Authentic interior furnishings include a baby 
grand piano made in Austria in 1870 for the king of Austria. The library serves 
as an ongoing historical data center and is used by faculty and students from 
several area universities. A gift shop is in the basement, along with 
memorabilia from famed cowboy Casey Tibbs. 
</P>
<P>
Outside are authentic Western buildings that were relocated and restored with 
help from the California Conservation Corps. An 1880 medicine wagon, once 
pulled by a team of horses, now has a 1926 Chevrolet engine and is fully 
operational. According to Woodward, children love the 7-ton jail where 
prisoners were once kept. "If they were like that today, these people wouldn't 
be so anxious to get back into them," said Woodward, a former agent with the 
Federal Bureau of Investigation.

JULIAN PIONEER MUSEUM 
</P>
<P>
2811 Washington St., Julian 
</P>
<P>
(619) 765-0227 
</P>
<P>
Open 10 a.m.-4 p.m. Saturday, Sunday, legal holidays (except Christmas, 
Thanksgiving, and New Year's Day). Open daily from April 1 through November. 
May be closed due to snow. 
</P>
<P>
 Inspired by the Julian Woman's Club and a large number of civic and political 
organizations, the Julian Pioneer Museum opened its doors in 1952. 
</P>
<P>
The building was originally a brewery and later a blacksmith shop. After two 
restorations, it has now been restored to its original turn-of-the-century 
configuration. Bursting with artifacts donated by local Julian pioneer 
families, the museum consists of a three-room structure. 
</P>
<P>
The oldest artifact is a small wall sampler from the 1700s. Carlson said the 
Weber square piano dating back to the 1880s is a favorite and catches 
everyone's eye. And the museum's collection of lace is "one of the best 
around." 
</P>
<P>
Julian's first pool table is one of the larger exhibits. On the smaller side, 
but no less intriguing, are a pair of thick, uncomfortable looking contact 
lenses, circa 1940. 
</P>
<P>
ANZA-BORREGO DESERT VISITOR CENTER 
</P>
<P>
Anza-Borrego State Park 
</P>
<P>
Borrego Springs 
</P>
<P>
(619) 767-4684 (recorded message) 
</P>
<P>
Open 9 a.m.-5 p.m. daily, October through May; 10 a.m.-3 p.m. Saturday, Sunday 
and holidays, June through September. 
</P>
<P>
 Park rangers and volunteers say a day trip will "whet your appetite" for 
exploring the Anza-Borrego Desert Park, the largest state park in California. 
This 600,000-acre retreat encompasses one of the richest living museums in the 
country. To understand what the desert is all about, a visit to the 
7,000-square-foot Visitor Center is a good place to start. 
</P>
<P>
After 10 years and $1 million, this subterranean structure emerged in 1979. 
Through use of native rock and desert landscaping, the building blends nicely 
into the environment. 
</P>
<P>
A 24-minute video runs every half hour and provides commentary and slides about 
camping sites in Palm Canyon, nature trails with self-guided maps, and canyon 
trails that are perfect for horseback riders and people with four-wheel-drive 
vehicles. 
</P>
<P>
After watching the video, you'll want to proceed to the room where artifacts 
and pictorial exhibits are displayed. One of the first displays is an Imperial 
Mammoth fossil found in the desert and believed to be from the Pleistocene age. 
</P>
<P>
If your visit coincides with a tour of the "back room," you will see 
fascinating artifacts of preserved animals, pelts, pottery and even a large 
oyster shell dating back millions of years when the area was under water. 
</P>
<P>
The center has a large gift shop with an extensive book inventory. Ask for a 
complimentary copy of the Anza-Borrego Desert newspaper, which is published 
annually. This contains a calendar of events that lists special seminars 
dealing with the fossil life of Anza Borrego, animals of the desert, tours of 
the paleontology lab and numerous other regularly scheduled events. 
</P>
<P>
Brochures and maps are available for those who want to take any one of the 
several self-guided hikes. 
</P>
<P>
PALOMAR OBSERVATORY 
</P>
<P>
Palomar Mountain 
</P>
<P>
Cleveland National Forest 
</P>
<P>
(619) 742-2119 
</P>
<P>
The dome and museum are open 9 a.m.-4 p.m. daily, except Dec. 24 and 25. The 
gift shop is open weekends during the winter, and daily from July 1-Aug. 31. 
</P>
<P>
 Visitors are sometimes disappointed to learn they cannot peek through the 
200-inch Hale telescope that is inside the 1,000-ton rotating dome atop Palomar 
Mountain. The telescope is owned and used for research by faculty and students 
at the California Institute of Technology. 
</P>
<P>
However, a glassed-in viewing platform provides an awesome view of the 
telescope that has been in continual operation since 1948. Its movable parts 
weigh about 530 tons. 
</P>
<P>
The mirror weighs 14.5 tons and has a range of well over 1 billion light-years, 
or 6,000,000,000,000,000,000,000 miles. 
</P>
<P>
Just inside the entryway of the dome is a replica of a reflecting-type 
telescope built by Sir Isaac Newton in 1668. That telescope was the forerunner 
for the Hale telescope, built three centuries later. 
</P>
<P>
Once you've had a chance to see the telescope, it is a short walk to the 
Greenway Museum where pictures and a video explain the telescope and how it is 
being used to unfold the mysteries of the universe. 
</P>
<P>
Visitors learn that light pollution has seriously inhibited the effectiveness 
of the Palomar Observatory. The rapid urbanization of Southern California has 
increased the amount of sky glow. The observation capacity of the 200-inch lens 
has already been reduced to 140 inches. 
</P>
<P>
Since the elevation of the observatory is 5,500 feet, it is wise to take along 
some warm clothing. Picnic tables are nearby. 
</P>
<P>
QUAIL BOTANICAL GARDENS 
</P>
<P>
230 Quail Gardens Drive, Encinitas 
</P>
<P>
(619) 436-3036 
</P>
<P>
$1 parking fee is requested. 
</P>
<P>
Closed Dec. 17-Jan. 1, but otherwise open daily 8 a.m.-5 p.m.; gift shop hours 
11 a.m.-3 p.m. Wednesday through Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
 The Quail Botanical Gardens includes a living museum where more than 5,000 
plant species flourish. Gardeners and naturalists will enjoy trekking through 
15 acres of plant life (another 15 acres are closed and designated a refuge for 
wildlife). 
</P>
<P>
Originally a private residence, the property was deeded to the county in 1957. 
</P>
<P>
Frost-free growing conditions provide a home away from home for tropical plants 
such as ferns, palms and uncommon fruit. You can see the West's largest 
collection of hibiscus and the largest grouping of the bamboo species in the 
United States. 
</P>
<P>
A demonstration garden has been created to educate homeowners about ways to use 
native plants in low water-use landscaping. Free tours are given every Saturday 
beginning at 10 a.m. The toddler's tour takes place the first Tuesday of every 
month at 10:30 a.m. 
</P>
<P>
Docents say the botanical gardens have become a favorite place for wedding 
ceremonies and family portraits. If interested, call the office for more 
information. 
</P>
<P>
ANTIQUE GAS &amp; STEAM ENGINE MUSEUM 
</P>
<P>
240 N. Santa Fe Ave., Vista. 
</P>
<P>
(619) 941-1791 
</P>
<P>
Open daily 10 a.m.-4 p.m.; Closed Christmas and New Years. 
</P>
<P>
 Situated in a rapidly diminishing rural neighborhood in Vista, the Antique Gas 
&amp; Steam Engine Museum is a find for anyone interested in farm life at the 
turn of the century or vintage machinery. About 1,100 members of the California 
Early Days Gas Engine &amp; Tractor Assn. collect and restore artifacts on the 
40-acre site. 
</P>
<P>
Much of the machinery is in working condition and is put into action when the 
club stages two major Threshing Bee &amp; Antique Engine shows during the third 
and fourth weekends of June and October. 
</P>
<P>
Visitors can walk the grounds and see vintage tractors, thrashers, hand-cranked 
autos and horse-drawn carts. Be sure to notice a large piece of equipment, 
which is a Fairbanks Morse 25,000-kilowatt generator. This was the generator 
that powered Catalina during the 1920s and 1930s. Not far from the generator is 
a steam-operated saw mill and a one-third scale train. 
</P>
<P>
The museum building houses most of the restored or valuable equipment, like an 
Foos gasoline engine and a 1930 Buick Master Six Tractor. Collectors will be 
interested in the large assortment of oil cans that have evolved over the 
years. Along these same lines are displays of barbed wire dating to the 
mid-1800s. Another building houses a blacksmith and wheelwright shop. Members 
gather on the first Saturday of each month for blacksmithing classes. 
</P>
<P>
HERITAGE WALK 
</P>
<P>
Grape Day Park, Escondido 
</P>
<P>
(619) 743-8207 
</P>
<P>
Open 1 p.m.-4 p.m., Thursday through Saturday; Closed Dec. 22, 27, 28, 29. 
</P>
<P>
Historic structures and artifacts were relocated to Grape Day Park initially as 
a local tribute to the nation's Bicentennial in 1976. The effort was 
spearheaded by the Escondido Historical Society and supported by civic and 
community leaders. Today, the complex has grown and serves as a showcase for 
other heritage parks. 
</P>
<P>
The heritage walk begins with a visit to Escondido's first library, which dates 
to 1894 and retains its original facade. Escondido Historical Society Director 
Norm Syler has an office inside the library. The library also serves as a gift 
shop and storehouse for historical archives. 
</P>
<P>
One of the popular attractions is the Victorian home, circa 1890. It has been 
restored through careful research and collaboration with the Hoffmann family, 
former residents of the home for many years. Most of the furnishings were 
donated by local residents. This year the historical society threw a 100th 
birthday party for the house, and Syler said three of the Hoffmann daughters 
attended. 
</P>
<P>
Children enjoy the 1888 Santa Fe Depot best of all, according to Syler. It has 
been restored close to its original condition and even old graffiti remain on 
one of the walls. For many years the depot served as the communication center 
for Escondido residents. Today, children can try their hand at tapping out 
messages on a telegraph machine. Artifacts such as the original roll-front 
ticket cabinet, a huge safe and old typewriters serve as reminders of bygone 
days. Behind the depot is a railroad car, circa 1925. 
</P>
<P>
OLD POWAY PARK 
</P>
<P>
Midland Road, Poway 
</P>
<P>
Completion set for 1991 
</P>
<P>
Construction coordinator/historian is Frank Lorey, (619) 486-4114. 
</P>
<P>
Although the museum complex is still under construction, it is expected to be 
completed next year. The 5-acre complex will be similar to the Heritage Walk in 
Escondido. 
</P>
<P>
Already visible are the railroad station and locomotive barn that will be fully 
functional when finished. The old Templar's Hall, the Armstrong house and the 
Porter house have already been relocated to the property and are undergoing 
restoration. 
</P>
<P>
The museum's centerpiece will likely be the restored 1907 Baldwin-built steam 
engine that was originally used in the San Francisco area. Poway resident Col. 
Porter used to run it on weekends until his death in 1963. 
</P>
