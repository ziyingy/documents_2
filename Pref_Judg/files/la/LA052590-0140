What does the California Highway Patrol advise to ease the headache of the 
hectic Memorial Day holiday weekend, when it seems everyone has places to go, 
people to see and things to do? 
</P>
<P>
"I think everyone should stay home, put their feet up and relax," said Linda 
Burrus, spokeswoman for the CHP in Santa Ana. 
</P>
<P>
But of course, she acknowledges there is scant chance this will happen. 
</P>
<P>
So for those folks who insist on hitting the streets, Burrus has a few 
suggestions on how to avoid the worst traffic congestion during the long 
weekend. 
</P>
<P>
"It's going to be heavy Thursday and worse on Friday," she said. "Probably east 
on 91 (Riverside Freeway) is going to be real hectic. And south to San Diego, 
so 405 will be bad. Sunday and Monday night will be real heavy heading back 
from the border and toward the coastal areas from the desert."

<P>
Get the picture?

"This is, of course, the beginning of the summer holidays, and if the weather 
is nice, then everyone sets out to do sports kinds of things, like dirt-biking, 
like heading for the desert or the mountains, like fishing, or going to the 
river," she said. 
</P>
<P>
And yes, the weather will be nice. 
</P>
<P>
Steve Burback, a meteorologist for WeatherData Inc., of Wichita, Kan., which 
provides weather forecasts for The Times, said the weekend will be "really 
pleasant." 
</P>
<P>
Along the coast, high temperatures will reach the upper 60s, with some late 
night and morning clouds. Inland, the mercury will reach the 70s to the 
mid-80s. 
</P>
<P>
"But it'll be dry and there will be some sea breezes," he said. "Yes, it sounds 
like a perfect weekend." MARIA NEWMAN
