The van carrying abused children from the MacLaren Children's Center drives up 
to an ominous high-rise building with "Criminal Courts" written on the 
entrance. The children are driven into a high-security garage and the same 
caged-off entrance where the Night Stalker was brought for his day in court. 
The children's van halts behind a long black-and-white sheriff's bus filled 
with men wearing jail-issue blue jumpsuits. The children, age 4 to 18, wait 
while the men disembark in shackles and chains. 
</P>
<P>
Frequently the children ask if they are being taken to jail. But there is 
little time to explain that Dependency Court is separate from Criminal Court. 
The children, who have already suffered physical and sexual abuse, are 
frightened and disoriented. 
</P>
<P>
The system is confusing, but it typically works like this: 
</P>
<P>
Someone reports that children have been abused or neglected. Social workers 
investigate. If the children are in danger, they are taken away from home. 
Within three days, they must be brought into court for an initial detention 
hearing. During this period, they may be prevented from having any contact with 
their parents. The first time they are together again is in court, usually with 
an attorney sitting between the parents and the children. The proceeding will 
determine whether the children will return home or be put in foster care.

Last year, the Los Angeles County Juvenile Dependency Court conducted 56,136 
hearings -- nearly three times the caseload a decade ago. About 40,000 
children, by conservative estimates, are now under court supervision in the 
county. 
</P>

"The quantity of cases and shortcomings of CPS (Child Protective Services) 
create a substantial risk that the quality of justice desirable may not be 
achieved in this system," says presiding Judge Paul Boland, a champion of 
children's rights, who is doing his utmost to make the courts family-oriented. 
"Just as the children are at risk, the quality of justice in this system is at 
risk." 
</P>
<P>
Dependency Court is in the same judicial loop as the civil and criminal courts, 
and the contrast in how they operate is a reflection of the low esteem in which 
the county holds children at risk. In civil court, a judge may reserve 10 days 
to settle a $250,000 property dispute. In Dependency Court, a judge may have 
only 10 minutes to decide the fate of a child. Tens of thousands of children, 
predominantly minorities and poor, have had their lives changed in these 
10-minute legal proceedings, in which the judgments often are based on 
fragmentary reports. But who dares protest? Children can't vote.

While the court personnel prepare for the daily grind of justice, a boy with 
immaculately combed hair and sad eyes, wearing a red sweater and red bow tie, 
is brought up on a freight elevator and taken to a dimly lit room furnished 
with a television set and not much else. There he waits with dozens of other 
children until a stranger calls his name and he is taken to a courtroom. The 
children may wait for a few minutes or all day. Sometimes they are never called 
and they go back to MacLaren Hall to wonder where their families are, and if 
they will be reunited, and when.

In a holding tank converted into a narrow waiting room, the light filters 
through iron bars. A girl with blonde curls and a husky Latino boy are eating 
peanuts off the floor. "Animals!" a woman snaps at them, and goes on in this 
vein, unleashing her frustration. This out-of-control adult yelling at 
out-of-control children in the out-of-control courts is a snapshot of the whole 
out-of-control system. 
</P>
<P>
Hundreds of people -- mothers, fathers, children, grandparents, friends -- sit 
on hard wooden benches in a corridor outside the courtrooms. There is no 
privacy. No place to consult quietly with an attorney. 
</P>
<P>
Nine out of 10 families in Dependency Court can't afford private legal counsel; 
they have court-appointed attorneys -- the same attorneys who simultaneously 
represent the county. This is a conflict of interest that is routinely weighted 
against the child. 
</P>
<P>
A bailiff calls a name, and a broken family -- mother and ex-husband -- goes 
into the courtroom. A toddler who was allegedly abused sexually by her mother's 
boyfriend calls frantically after her. The little girl is given a lollipop. The 
judge, overwhelmed with papers, sends the girl back to live with her mother, 
despite allegations that the child-abusing boyfriend is surreptitiously 
visiting her. "They don't listen!" laments the father. 
</P>
<P>
Ten minutes later, in the same courtroom, a janitor pushes through the swinging 
gate and halts directly behind a desk where two parents with histories of drug 
abuse sit waiting for the verdict. A deputy dumps a waste basket into the 
trashbin and the janitor rolls it out, while the judge reads into the record 
that the couple's three children are being placed in the custody of the state 
until 1992. 
</P>
<P>
A generation of children is being treated like trash. The abuse of young lives 
and of justice is going on in full view of City Hall -- and of the Los Angeles 
media that inhabit the hallways covering movie stars' suits and celebrity 
murderers. The horror cases that make the news -- children abandoned, tortured, 
even killed by their caretakers -- don't diminish the general horror of 
children routinely, systematically, neglected by the court. 
</P>
<P>
Should society pour more money into this charade of justice? The county is 
considering plans for a new child-oriented Dependency Court facility away from 
downtown. But unless there is also a program to prevent abuse, the new 
courtrooms will immediately be overwhelmed. 
</P>
<P>
"If funds were spent providing in-home family services at the point where the 
family first appears to be in crisis," thousands of cases could be resolved 
without going to court, Judge Boland says. 
</P>
<P>
Shortsightedly, child-abuse prevention doesn't rank with crime prevention in 
Gov. George Deukmejian's agenda. No wonder these stepchildren of the state, 
having suffered multiple abuses, including judicial and political neglect, 
predictably will turn someday against the state -- and against themselves and 
their children. 
</P>
<P>
At day's end, the children leave the garage looking back with huge eyes at the 
Dickensian courthouse, which now stands between them and their families. Many 
of them will return to this building in shackles, and some will be remanded to 
the custody of the state for as long as they live. 
</P>
<P>
Abused children cry out for protection, for affection and for guidance to grow 
up like other children. If they are denied what they deserve, they will come 
back to haunt us. 
</P>
