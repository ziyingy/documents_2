A federal judge on Monday ordered more than 100,000 cases nationwide involving 
victims of asbestos-related diseases consolidated into a single class action in 
a dramatic attempt to clear a huge court backlog. 
</P>
<P>
The surprise ruling by Thomas D. Lambros, chief judge of U.S. District Court in 
Cleveland, comes amid mounting problems with a trust set up by Manville Corp. 
to compensate workers killed or injured from handling asbestos. 
</P>
<P>
Plaintiffs' lawyers said they expected the order to be challenged in a federal 
appeals court. 
</P>
<P>
The move preempted a similar action threatened by U.S. District Court Judge 
Jack B. Weinstein in Brooklyn, who has sought to take charge of fixing the 
financially ailing Manville trust fund and clearing the asbestos backlog. 
</P>
<P>
Weinstein last week ordered the trust to halt all payments to victims until he 
receives a proposal on Aug. 6 to restructure and refinance the trust, which was 
created in 1988 as part of Manville's bankruptcy court reorganization. 
</P>
<P>
The trust is out of cash to pay new claims and has said that people who file 
claims now may not be compensated until well into the next century. 
</P>
<P>
Asbestos-related cases form the largest number of personal injury lawsuits in 
the country. Lambros said more than 100,000 claims have been filed in federal 
and state courts nationwide. Thousands of others await resolution with the 
Manville trust. 
</P>
<P>
Several dozen companies that manufactured asbestos and the Manville trust, 
which is legally separate from the company, are defendants in the cases. 
</P>
<P>
In a four-page order, Lambros said the asbestos litigation meets the 
requirement for creating a class action because "there are insufficient funds 
among all of the defendants to pay all meritorious claims" and the cost of 
litigation. 
</P>
<P>
The judge said that since 1982, Manville and several other companies have 
sought bankruptcy court protection because of thousands of lawsuits seeking 
asbestos compensation, while other companies are "approaching the brink of 
bankruptcy." 
</P>
<P>
All cases filed under the umbrella of a class action are bound by a single 
court judgment, eliminating the need for individual trials and out-of-court 
settlements. It also raises the possibility of an adverse ruling that would 
affect all cases. 
</P>
<P>
Manville once was the nation's largest maker of asbestos, which was used widely 
for decades because of its natural heat resistance and insulation properties. 
It later was identified as carcinogenic. 
</P>
<P>
Manville, based in Denver, emerged from Chapter 11 proceedings in 1988 and no 
longer makes asbestos.
