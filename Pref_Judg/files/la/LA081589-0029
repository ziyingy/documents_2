President Bush signed legislation that will speed $897 million in assistance to 
farmers whose crops he said had been battered this year by "the forces of 
nature." The bulk of the aid -- $400 million -- will go to wheat farmers whose 
winter harvest in Kansas and other states was devastated by drought. At the 
other extreme, the Disaster Assistance Act will compensate farmers in the South 
and elsewhere whose rice, soybean, cotton and other crops were wiped out by 
rain, wind and floods. Bush, saying "money's tight," noted that the package 
will "provide relief only to those farmers hardest hit by adverse weather. And 
it wisely rewards those who took the prudent step of purchasing crop 
insurance." The House had passed a $1.4-billion drought relief bill in June, 
but, under pressure from the White House and the Senate, it acceded to the 
version signed by Bush.
