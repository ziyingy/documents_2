Long delayed by an arduous jury selection process and numerous evidentiary 
hearings, the Superior Court trial of David Allen Lucas began Tuesday -- four 
years after the former Spring Valley carpet cleaner was arrested and accused in 
a string of brutal slayings between 1979 and 1984. 
</P>
<P>
In an hourlong opening statement, prosecutors revealed nothing new but told 
jurors that physical evidence and testimony from one victim who survived an 
attack will link Lucas to "the most vicious and cold-blooded murders San Diego 
County has ever had to suffer." 
</P>
<P>
Lawyers representing Lucas pledged in their opening remarks to prove that their 
client is as much a victim as the six women and two toddlers whose throats he 
allegedly slashed. During a 90-minute preview of their case, the defense 
attorneys blamed another man for two of the slayings and sought to pump holes 
in testimony and other prosecution evidence said to implicate Lucas in four 
other killings. 
</P>
<P>
"I believe when you hear all the evidence in this case and evaluate it 
objectively, you will find David Lucas is not guilty of these charges," 
attorney Alex Landon told the 12 jurors and six alternates hearing the case. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Could Face Death Penalty 
</P>
<P>
Lucas, 33, was arrested Dec. 16, 1984, at his home in Spring Valley. He is 
charged with six counts of murder, one count of attempted murder and two counts 
of kidnaping. If convicted of the murder charges, Lucas could face the death 
penalty. His trial, before Superior Court Judge Laura Palmer Hammes, is 
expected to last six months. 
</P>
<P>
The courtroom was packed for the trial's long-awaited launching Tuesday, with 
relatives of Lucas and his alleged victims watching intently as opening 
arguments and testimony from four prosecution witnesses unfolded. 
</P>
<P>
Lucas, a tall blond with an athletic build who operated his own carpet cleaning 
business at the time of his arrest, sat motionless throughout much of the day, 
occasionally jotting notes and conferring with his two attorneys. When jurors 
filed out for court recesses, he stood and smiled. 
</P>
<P>
Deputy Dist. Atty. Daniel Williams, who is prosecuting the case with assistance 
from Deputy Dist. Atty. George Clarke, used his opening statement to provide 
jurors with a chronological overview of the six murders and one attempted 
murder Lucas is charged with committing. 
</P>
<P>
In a solemn tone, Williams began his remarks by reciting the grim details of 
the throat wound that the seven victims shared -- "a massive incision to the 
upper neck, which extended in depth to the neck bone." The murder victims' 
throats were slashed with such force, investigators have said, that they were 
nearly decapitated. 
</P>
<P>
According to the prosecution's version, Lucas struck first on May 4, 1979, 
killing Suzanne Camille Jacobs, 31, and her son Colin, 3, in the family's 
Normal Heights home. Williams said one neighbor spotted a sports car -- similar 
to one driven by Lucas -- in the Jacobs' driveway that morning, while another 
noticed a blond man in the front yard. 
</P>
<P>
"Mr. (Michael) Jacobs came home that afternoon and found his wife and son . . . 
with their necks cut, their necks slashed," Williams said. "There was a massive 
amount of blood." 
</P>
<P>
Scouring the scene for clues, police found two key pieces of evidence, Williams 
said -- a bloody boot print and a note, bearing the words "Love Insurance" and 
a telephone number, on a rug in the bathroom. 
</P>
<P>
The boot print, Williams argued, "matches in every detail the type of sole" on 
a pair of boots Lucas allegedly had purchased a month earlier. As for the note, 
an analysis showed the handwriting matched that of Lucas, who purchased a Love 
Insurance policy soon after the slayings, Williams said. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Other Slayings 
</P>
<P>
The next murder Lucas is charged with committing occurred Dec. 8, 1981, when 
real estate agent Gayle Garcia, 29, was found slain in a Spring Valley home she 
was scheduled to show to prospective buyers that day. Prosecutors said evidence 
will show Lucas had been searching the classified ads for a new home in Spring 
Valley at the time of the Garcia killing and that he was missing from work the 
afternoon the agent was killed. 
</P>
<P>
On June 7, 1984, Jodie Santiago Robertson of Seattle was kidnaped while walking 
to her brother's house from an El Cajon restaurant about 10 p.m. At Lucas' 
preliminary hearing, Robertson identified him as the man who abducted her at 
knifepoint, drove her to a house, and choked her until she lost consciousness. 
Robertson does not recall what happened next, but she was found the next day 
beside a rural road, half-naked and with her throat slashed. 
</P>
<P>
On Tuesday, Williams said Lucas sold his sports car and bought a pickup truck 
two days after the press disclosed that Robertson had been attacked but 
survived. 
</P>
<P>
Lucas also is charged with three additional murders -- those of Rhonda Strang, 
24; Amber Fisher, 3, a girl Strang was baby-sitting, and Anne Catherine Swanke, 
a 22-year-old University of San Diego student, who was abducted when her car 
ran out of gas late at night. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Composite Sketch 
</P>
<P>
It was not until after Swanke's death on Nov. 20, 1984, that attention began to 
focus on Lucas. Police sensed a pattern in the attack on Robertson and the 
killings of Strang, Swanke and Fisher, and released a composite sketch of the 
assailant based on Robertson's description. 
</P>
<P>
Defense attorneys said Tuesday that a "frantic search" for the killer -- based 
in part on a reward posted by Swanke's family and pressure to solve the crimes 
-- led authorities to wrongly accuse Lucas. 
</P>
<P>
Particularly egregious, attorney Steven Temko argued, are the charges involving 
the deaths of Suzanne and Colin Jacobs -- whose murders another man, Johnny 
Massingale, had confessed to committing. Massingale, an illiterate Kentucky 
drifter, was initially arrested as a prime suspect in the Jacobs killings after 
an Alabama man told a Texas Ranger that he had met a man who claimed to have 
"damn near decapitated" two people in San Diego. 
</P>
<P>
Massingale confessed to the slayings during an interrogation. But three weeks 
after Lucas was arrested, the drifter was released when prosecutors conceded 
that they had reservations about his guilt all along and concluded that his 
statements were coerced. 
</P>
<P>
On Tuesday, Temko argued that Massingale indicated in his confession that he 
knew things only the killer could know -- such as details of the crime scene 
and the nature of the wounds. 
</P>
<P>
As for the other deaths, the defense team argued that sloppy police work -- 
resulting in the disappearance of a fingerprint found on the Love Insurance 
note and a mix-up involving fingernail clippings from Swanke -- may have caused 
the loss of evidence that might have exonerated Lucas. 
</P>
<P>
Temko also suggested that Garcia's boyfriend -- who was killed last year -- was 
a strong suspect in her death. And Strang, he argued, had obtained a 
restraining order against her husband -- who allegedly was dealing narcotics -- 
not long before she was killed. 
</P>
<P>
Landon concluded the defense presentation by raising doubts about the 
credibility of Robertson, the strongest witness the prosecution has in its case 
against Lucas. Noting that Robertson has been diagnosed as having 
post-traumatic stress syndrome, Landon argued that she has "a need for 
resolution" and "the need to find the person who did this to her."
