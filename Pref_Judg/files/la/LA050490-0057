<P>
A recent international survey shows that three-fourths of the scientists 
involved in climate-change research believe that global temperatures already 
are rising in response to civilization's intensification of nature's 
"greenhouse effect." 
</P>
<P>
But in spite of massive research efforts now under way, the conclusion that 
global warming is a reality seems to be heavily based on intuition and general 
knowledge of climate rather than specific research on the subject. 
</P>
<P>
Fewer than half of the respondents (41%) said they believe scientific evidence 
now in hand supports the conclusion that accelerated warming of the atmosphere 
is taking place. And 71% said they believe temperature increases over the last 
century are within the range of normal climatic fluctuation. 
</P>
<P>
The survey, to be published next week, was carried out by Global Change 
Environmental Report, an Arlington, Mass., newsletter that mailed 
questionnaires to 1,500 climate change scientists around the world. More than 
330 scientists in 41 countries responded. 
</P>
<P>
The results indicated that the world scientific community is subject to some of 
the same disagreements that for months have divided environmentalists and 
policy-makers. But there was little dispute over the validity of the 
much-discussed phenomenon itself. 
</P>
<P>
Of those surveyed, 96% said they believe the basic greenhouse effect thesis -- 
that increasing concentrations of carbon dioxide, methane, water vapor and 
other trace gases will cause the earth's atmosphere to trap more of the sun's 
heat and raise world temperatures. 
</P>
<P>
Nearly two-thirds (65%) said they believe the odds are better than 50-50 that 
global temperatures will rise by three degrees over the next century. 
</P>
<P>
While that is at the lower range of projections now accepted by the United 
Nations-sanctioned Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change, 89% said they 
consider the threat serious enough to warrant immediate steps to limit carbon 
dioxide emissions. 
</P>
<P>
Brady Hurley, the newsletter editor, said the survey was designed to elicit 
scientific opinion rather than to assess firm conclusions that can be drawn on 
the basis of existing evidence. 
</P>
<P>
For government officials, the global warming debate for the last year has 
focused increasingly on the issue of reducing carbon dioxide emissions from 
fossil fuel combustions. 
</P>
<P>
Several European governments, led by the Netherlands, have adopted plans for 
stabilization of carbon dioxide emissions, followed by outright reduction. The 
Bush Administration has refrained from endorsing such proposals, maintaining 
that it needs more information on the science of climate change and the 
economic impact of carbon dioxide reduction. 
</P>
<P>
At a White House-sponsored conference last month, the Administration found 
itself at odds with European officials who were more interested in discussing 
plans for action than for additional research. 
</P>
<P>
The conference was followed by an international gathering of parliamentarians, 
who urged governments to take steps to combat climate warming, although 
scientists studying computer models still are unable to forecast the regional 
consequences of increased temperatures. 
</P>
<P>
Of the scientists responding to the newsletter survey, 71% said they believe a 
global temperature rise of a few degrees would cause "major detrimental impacts 
for humanity." 
</P>
<P>
Of those, 91% said they would expect changes in rainfall patterns sufficient to 
shift world food production, 88% foresaw a rise in sea levels, and 66% 
predicted an increase in the severity of tropical storms.
