<P>
The general synod of the Church of England voted overwhelmingly today in favor 
of allowing women to become priests. 
</P>
<P>
The controversial question of whether women should be ordained will now be 
considered by diocesan synods, and the change ultimately must be approved by 
both houses of Parliament and by the queen. 
</P>
<P>
Archbishop of Canterbury Robert A. K. Runcie said before the measure was 
approved, "I remain of the conviction that the ordination of women to the 
priesthood ought to be construed as an enlargement and extension of the 
historic Christian ministry." 
</P>
<P>
The vote in favor of women priests in the three-tiered general synod, or church 
Parliament, was 34 to 17 among bishops, 149 to 85 among clergy and 144 to 78 
among laity, with three abstentions. 
</P>
<P>
Women favoring ordination maintained a 24-hour vigil ending Monday night 
outside the church leader's home at London's Lambeth Palace.
