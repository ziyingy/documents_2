The right to a "safe and healthful" workplace under state law does not include 
a smoke-free environment, an appellate court in Santa Ana ruled Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
The decision leaves David B. McCoy, a piano tuner at Cal State Fullerton and a 
passionate foe of smoking, assigned to work in a building with sealed windows 
and a ventilation system that he claims merely recirculates smoke-tainted air. 
</P>
<P>
In a lawsuit against his employer, McCoy claimed unsuccessfully that he 
deserves the same protection from second-hand smoke he contends that the 
university affords to books, plants and computers. 
</P>
<P>
In the suit, McCoy stated that his health was being ruined by constant exposure 
to smoke and that he had an allergy that left him wheezing, dizzy, suffering 
from headaches, nausea, fatigue and anxiety, all due to the university's 
inadequate effort to control the noxious fumes. 
</P>
<P>
But in 1987, an Orange County Superior Court judge ruled that the school had 
complied with a 1982 state law that prohibits smoking at meetings in 
government-funded offices and requires supervisors to try to accommodate 
nonsmokers' needs. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
School's Efforts Upheld 
</P>
<P>
The state appellate court's unanimous decision Thursday upheld that ruling. 
</P>
<P>
In its opinion, the 4th District Court of Appeal noted that the university bans 
smoking in classrooms, lecture halls, laboratories, theaters, gymnasiums, 
library reading areas, public assembly areas and common work areas. In fact, 
the opinion said, its policy is "far stricter" than the law requires. 
</P>
<P>
The court found that the university has done much to restrict the adverse 
impact of second-hand smoke. 
</P>
<P>
"The silence by the Legislature as to the details on how to achieve smoke-free 
work stations necessarily implies that each department or agency has the 
discretion to choose methods necessary to accommodate the legislative 
objectives in the context of the peculiarities of their individual work 
places," the opinion held. 
</P>
<P>
Cal State Fullerton has restricted smoking on its campus since 1978 and has 
regularly reviewed its smoking policy, the court noted. 
</P>
<P>
Despite the apparent setback, McCoy's lawyer, Stephen Berger of Newport Beach, 
said his client believes that things have improved as a result of the lawsuit. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
'A Little Better' 
</P>
<P>
"Things have gotten a little better," Berger said. "I think our lawsuit did 
cause them to start enforcing the smoking rules. They banned smoke in a couple 
of new places. We still have a problem, but it's better." 
</P>
<P>
Berger had urged the appellate court to find that a smoke-free environment 
should be required under in a state law mandating that "every employer shall 
furnish employment and a place of employment which are safe and healthful to 
employees therein." 
</P>
<P>
The court declined to do so but did offer some hope to those who oppose 
smoking. 
</P>
<P>
"A review of the authorities indicates that in a proper case, the court looks 
favorably on the plight of a nonsmoker in today's society. This is not such a 
case," the opinion said. 
</P>
<P>
Citing the experiences of a Turkish sultan, the court also rejected McCoy's 
claim that Cal State Fullerton's impressive smoking policy was not being 
enforced. 
</P>
<P>
Among those who have tried and failed to stamp out smoking, the court said, 
were Murad IV, a 17th-Century Turkish monarch; King James I of England, and 
early colonists in Massachusetts. 
</P>
<P>
McCoy filed several grievances over working conditions, but none was 
successful. He also helped organize a petition drive seeking a prohibition on 
smoking anywhere on campus. That also failed, despite a referendum in 1987 that 
showed 72% of the student body favored such a ban. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Wouldn't Snitch 
</P>
<P>
McCoy claimed that, in response to his complaints, the administration provided 
him with an air cleaner and a respirator mask to wear at work. He also said 
that administrators encouraged him to turn in smokers who violated the rules 
but that, according to court documents, he refused to become a "spy, snitch or 
tattler." 
</P>
<P>
McCoy works in the Performing Arts Building under the title of instrument 
technician. Berger said McCoy has had some success in pursuing a claim of 
partial disability as a result of workplace conditions. 
</P>
<P>
McCoy could not be reached, and a university spokesman declined comment.
