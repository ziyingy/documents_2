The manager of the Travel Inn Motel, Bharat Thakkar, 28, of Carlsbad was 
charged with conspiring to smuggle aliens and two counts of harboring aliens, 
federal prosecutors said. The six others, all of whom are in custody, were 
indicted on charges that ranged from conspiracy to transporting aliens, 
Assistant U.S. Atty. George C. Aguilar said. The immigrants were charged $250 
to $300 to go to drop houses in Santa Ana and Los Angeles, he said.
