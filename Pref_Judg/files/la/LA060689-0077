The Orange County Grand Jury issued a brief report Monday, commending the new 
Child Abuse Services Team for its "good planning and coordinated effort" in 
handling about 3,500 sexual-abuse cases last year. 
</P>
<P>
The program was established in December, 1987, by Supervisor Gaddi H. Vasquez 
to handle the sensitive and special needs of child sexual-abuse victims 
involved in the legal process. The report said, for example, that previously, a 
victim could be subjected to as many as 25 "interrogations . . . often in 
intimidating atmospheres."

<P>
The Child Abuse Services Team, with an annual budget of $234,382, includes 
representatives from the court, law enforcement agencies, Social Services 
Agency, Health Care Agency and private support groups.

"This program exemplifies what can be accomplished when the county's private 
and public sectors work closely together," the grand jury said. "In spite of 
the role of child advocate being an unfamiliar one for the district attorney's 
office, the department has made the transition extremely well." 
</P>
<P>
The grand jury recommended that the supervisors continue funding for the 
program, despite their tight fiscal outlook. And it said the district 
attorney's office should "continue its active role." 
</P>
<P>
Cathy Campbell, director of the program, said it has been assured funding 
through November and is being reviewed for continued financial support from the 
county. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm thrilled that (the grand jurors) were as supportive as they were," she 
said. "It's my hope that this program will remain funded; it's too important 
not to be funded."

Budget officials from the county administrative office were unavailable for 
comment Monday.
