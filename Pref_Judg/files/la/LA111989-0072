Just west of the rushing whitewater river that marks the western boundary of 
Glacier National Park stands a 150-foot oil derrick, a thorn in the side of 
environmentalists. 
</P>
<P>
This well is no longer a threat to the ecology of the park. After months of 
controversy, drilling was abandoned in late October and the well was capped -- 
not out of concerns for the environment, but because no oil was found. 
</P>
<P>
Now the oil exploration companies have their eyes on other drilling sites in 
the region, and that has environmentalists worried. 
</P>
<P>
National conservation groups have observed for years that environmental 
problems seldom observe man-made boundaries. They have warned that the national 
parks are threatened from development both inside and outside their boundaries. 
</P>
<P>
The Wilderness Society last year listed parks it considered endangered because 
of development. Glacier National Park was on that list, with oil drilling cited 
as a major worry. 
</P>
<P>
But the state Board of Oil and Gas Conservation in September voted unanimously 
to approve the project after 2 1/2 days of hearings in which four wildlife 
experts testified that drilling would affect grizzly bears, wolves and bald 
eagles. 
</P>
<P>
The board also heard from 9-year-old Shinnah Sullivan of Whitefish, Mont., who 
said she represented a group called Children for Wildlife. 
</P>
<P>
"Animals have rights too," she told the board. "I bet they would say a lot if 
they could talk about this. I worry and wonder if there won't be a place for 
them in the North Fork when I grow up." 
</P>
<P>
But supporters of the well pointed out that it was on private property. 
</P>
<P>
"When a private landowner can't do lawfully what he wants to on his land, then 
we have the true endangered species: the free American," said Dan Blomquist of 
nearby Columbia Falls. 
</P>
<P>
The board issued a new permit with some conditions covering public safety and 
pollution. Board chairman Jim Nelson said the hearings were not in vain. 
</P>
<P>
"It's clear now that this board has a duty to ensure protection of the 
environment," he said. "That's one of the criticisms we've had on this: that we 
don't know what is going on." 
</P>
<P>
Now the U.S. Forest Service and the Bureau of Land Management have approved the 
drilling of two more wells south of Glacier next summer. 
</P>
<P>
"All the oil development scenarios have an impact," said Riley McClelland, a 
Park Service eagle expert. "A dry hole would have the least impact; however, 
with each incremental step in oil-field development, the degree of risk to bald 
eagles increases." 
</P>
<P>
"The industry thinks that no place should be out of bounds or off limits, but 
that's not true," said Jim Jensen of the Montana Environmental Information 
Center. "There are places on the earth where dangerous development, where any 
kind of industrialization doesn't belong. This beautiful corridor is one of 
them." 
</P>
<P>
The MEIC and another environmental group filed the suit challenging the state's 
initial decision to issue a drilling permit, contending that 
public-participation laws were ignored. 
</P>
<P>
The well, accessible from a gravel road where deer are a common sight, is just 
half a mile from the North Fork of the Flathead River, Glacier's western 
boundary and a designated wild and scenic river. 
</P>
<P>
It is the first well to actually be drilled in recent years near the park. 
Three others have been proposed but have been delayed by environmental 
challenges. 
</P>
<P>
Cenex, the exploration company, received speedy approval of its July 
application for the test well because it is located on private land and not 
subject to the review process required for drilling on public lands. 
</P>
<P>
In the last decade, concerns have been raised about logging, subdivisions, 
roads and -- in particular -- an open-pit coal mine proposed eight miles to the 
north of the park in British Columbia. 
</P>
<P>
The coal mine proposal was recently dropped, logging has been scaled back and a 
compromise plan was accepted for improving the highway leading to the park. 
</P>
<P>
But proposals for oil and gas drilling remain alive, with little middle ground 
evident between the companies proposing wells and the groups opposing them. 
</P>
<P>
Industry officials say modern drilling technology leaves little mark on the 
land. 
</P>
<P>
"I have been a little puzzled by the degree of public reaction," said Janelle 
Fallan, head of the Montana Petroleum Assn. "You'd think this was a major 
open-pit copper mine that was going to be there 50 years and disturbing 
hundreds of acres." 
</P>
<P>
In fact, she said, the rig takes up a relatively small area that will be 
reclaimed once the well is capped. 
</P>
<P>
Joe Keating, director of oil and gas operations for Cenex, said the industry 
believed for years that the portion of the Overthrust Belt near Glacier would 
not produce oil or gas, largely because the pockets were covered by such a deep 
layer of stone that they could not be reached by drilling. 
</P>
<P>
But Keating said speculative geophysical work done in the area during the era 
of high oil prices reversed that thinking. 
</P>
<P>
Park Supt. Gil Lusk has criticized the state Oil and Gas Conservation 
Division's decision to issue a permit for the Cenex well using criteria applied 
to other wells around the state, most of which are located on the range land of 
eastern Montana. 
</P>
<P>
Both the industry and the oil and gas board need to realize that "there's a 
hell of a lot different about this area" of snowcapped mountains and glacial 
river valleys, he said. 
</P>
<P>
Lusk stressed that he believes some development might be acceptable near the 
park, if it is done properly. 
</P>
<P>
"There can be industry next to the park," he said. "That's not the issue. The 
issue is, is industry willing to invest to make it a good neighbor?" 
</P>
<P>
Lusk cited Columbia Falls Aluminum Co. as a business that has done just that by 
installing new equipment to reduce emissions that were blamed for killing trees 
and slowing tree growth in the area. 
</P>
<P>
But others believe a balance of development cannot -- or should not -- be 
struck. 
</P>
<P>
"This area is not appropriate for many reasons -- for aesthetics, for wildlife, 
for destroying the qualities of why people want to come here or live here," 
said John Frederick of the North Fork Preservation Assn., which filed legal 
challenges to both Cenex wells proposed in the area. 
</P>
<P>
Frederick lives in Polebridge, a tiny community five miles north of the well 
site. The preservation group he heads also has opposed the British Columbia 
coal mine, some subdivision efforts and proposals to pave the dirt road that 
leads to Polebridge.
