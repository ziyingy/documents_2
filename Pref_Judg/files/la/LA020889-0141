Texas plan for exporting hormone-free beef to the European Community is 
acceptable to the Bush Administration but might be rejected by the Europeans, a 
senior Agriculture Department official said today. 
</P>
<P>
The official, who asked not to be identified, said that U.S. negotiators had 
proposed a plan similar to one unveiled Tuesday by Texas Agriculture 
Commissioner Jim Hightower but that the community had dismissed it because it 
would not require testing for naturally occurring growth hormones.

<P>
Hightower's plan was "among the options explored with the EC that they 
rejected," the official said, adding that the community would retreat from its 
earlier negotiating position if it accepted Hightower's proposal. 
</P>
<P>
U.S. officials said they did not know whether the community would accept the 
Hightower plan, aimed at breaking a trade deadlock.

"We don't want to pour cold water on it," the official said. "If he can figure 
out some partial solution, we will not pour cold water on it."

Community agricultural counselor Derwent Renshaw disputed the American 
official's claim that Washington had already put forward the same plan and that 
the community had rejected it. "I must say I don't recall their making a 
proposal broadly along those lines," he said, adding that the community has not 
yet decided whether the Texas plan complies with community rules.

The Europeans, responding to consumers' concerns, banned on Jan. 1 imports of 
beef from cattle treated with hormones that promote growth. Washington, which 
maintains that the hormones pose no health risk if used correctly, retaliated 
by slapping 100% duties on $100 million worth of community imports.

4 Synthetic Hormones 
</P>
<P>
Under the Texas proposal, which Hightower implied was acceptable to the 
Europeans, the U.S. Agriculture Department would have to conduct tests to 
identify the presence of four synthetic hormones. Agriculture Department 
inspectors already sample and test for the synthetic hormones at 
slaughterhouses, he said. Under the Texas plan, U.S. inspectors would have to 
start live-animal tests. 
</P>
<P>
Significantly, no testing for such natural hormones as estrogen, progesterone 
and testosterone, banned in the European Community but legal in the United 
States, would be required, Hightower said. Producers would simply have to 
pledge not to treat their livestock with growth hormones.
