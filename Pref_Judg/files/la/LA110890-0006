<P>
As a governor and President who spent his entire 16 years in public office 
denigrating civil servants and extolling the virtues of the private sector, it 
seems totally inconsistent that the new Los Angeles state building, which will 
house 2,500 state employees, should be named in honor of Ronald Reagan (Oct. 
27).

<P>
Only Gov. George Deukmejian, who shares Reagan's philosophies, could be 
sufficiently insensitive to participate in such a sham. A savings and loan or a 
Defense Department building, perhaps; but a state official building? Never!
