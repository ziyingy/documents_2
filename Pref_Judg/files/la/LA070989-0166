John McCarthy, 32, a cameraman with Worldwide Television News, was kidnaped in 
Beirut in April, 1986. He is one of 15 foreigners missing in Lebanon. Nine are 
Americans.

Early last week the family had issued a statement in Beirut pleading with 
McCarthy's kidnapers to set him free to allow a final reunion with his mother.

"I urge you in the name of mercy, for which Islam is known, to fulfill the wish 
of a dying woman who wants to see her son before she dies," the family's 
statement in Arabic said.
