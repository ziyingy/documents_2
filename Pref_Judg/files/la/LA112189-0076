This ancient capital spreads across a wide valley in the Balkans and was once 
famed for its mountain air. Today, when the breeze comes from the East, it 
crosses the huge Kremikovtzi metals plant, turns dun-colored and settles in an 
ominous layer over the valley floor.

Dirty air is a familiar enough problem. The difference here is the way the 
Bulgarian government -- and, until recently, other governments in the East Bloc 
-- have responded to pollution and to those who complain about it.

Last month, members of a small Bulgarian environmental group, Eco-Glasnost, 
gathered in Sofia's Kristal Park to collect signatures on a petition to the 
government. Suddenly, militiamen and undercover police swarmed through the 
park. Petitioners and bystanders were kicked and punched, and more than 30 were 
hauled off in a police bus. The episode was watched by an amazed group of 
diplomats and other delegates to a large East-West conference on the 
implementation of environmental-protection provisions in the Helsinki Accords.

As the Iron Curtain rises fitfully across Eastern Europe it is unveiling a huge 
industrial dump. This reality does not mesh comfortably with the preconceptions 
that many of us bring to such a scene. Socialism meant planning, and planning 
excluded the possibility of waste and toxic side effects. If there was 
something to be feared in the Eastern brand of socialism besides its military 
power, it was that it seemed all too tidy: broad, traffic-free avenues 
constantly swept clean by babushki, busybodies in the parks nagging you to keep 
off the grass and the monotonous tracts of high-rise apartment buildings. 
Uniformity, predictability, even sterility -- not this toxic wasteland.

According to participants at the Sofia conference, Eastern Europe produces 
little more than one-third of the continent's gross domestic product but is 
responsible for two-thirds of its sulfur dioxide, the prime ingredient in smog 
and acid rain. Eastern European industry burns huge quantities of brown coal 
and uses twice the energy that the West does to produce the same dollar's worth 
of goods. Kaunis, a Lithuanian city of more than half a million people, has no 
waste-water treatment facilities whatsoever. A smuggled report from the 
Czechoslovakian Academy of Sciences contends that in northern Czechoslovakia 
pollution shortens life expectancy by three to four years. (The government pays 
a bonus -- the workers call it "burial money" -- to those willing to live in 
the region for more than 10 years.) The catalogue of East Bloc eco-misfortunes 
quickly becomes a long one.

Eastern Europe's independent environmentalists feel neglected by the West. One 
asked me why Americans are so concerned about Amazon rain forests and the 
glaciers of Antarctica but so indifferent to the toxins being churned out by 
the socialist camp. Another complained that Western Europeans want to work 
mainly with official (that is, government-controlled) groups in Eastern Europe.

While the idea of socialist pollution may not mesh smoothly with some 
Westerner's intellectual preconceptions, others may grind their gears at the 
idea of an anti-socialist environmentalism. Many American conservatives are 
suspicious of environmentalism; neo-conservative theoretician Norman Podhoretz 
argues that environmentalism is the way socialism could come to America. Petar 
Beron, a leader of Eco-Glasnost and an official of the Bulgarian Museum of 
Natural History, says, "Environmentalists in the U.S. attack private 
corporations and are on the left. They think that because we attack the 
government we are on the right." 
</P>
<P>
At a hearing in preparation for the Sofia conference, Sen. Timothy E. Wirth 
(D-Colo.), a strong environmentalist, warned that human rights concerns could 
interfere with negotiations on the environment. But the arrest of Eco-Glasnost 
petitioners demonstrated that, in Soviet Bloc countries, environmental progress 
cannot be easily separated from progress in human and political rights. 
</P>
<P>
East European governments eagerly sign international anti-pollution agreements, 
but if their citizens can't hold them to these commitments, who will? When 
governments in this region investigate or fine a polluter, one branch of 
government is investigating or paying off another. And, when all else fails, 
the "socialist" polluter states harass or arrest their critics. 
</P>
<P>
Despite these difficulties, environmentalism may be emerging as one of the most 
effective forces for building alternative democratic institutions amid the slag 
heaps of socialist failure. From the campaign against the paper mills on Lake 
Baikal in the Soviet Union to the outrage about the radioactive explosion at 
Chernobyl, environmentalism has helped dissident democratic intellectuals reach 
out for mass support. Long-suppressed national pride finds a healthy outlet in 
demands to protect sites of natural beauty and historical significance. 
</P>
<P>
Environmental issues are now almost universally acknowledged to transcend 
certain aspects of national sovereignty. By the end of the Sofia conference, 
pressures forced the release of the Eco-Glasnost protesters, and a delegation 
of their leaders was even welcomed into the conference. And just one week 
later, the hard-line Communist Party chief Todor Zhivkov abruptly "resigned." 
</P>
<P>
But many Eastern European environmentalists contend that the West must demand 
more than freedom of information and expression in order to clean up the toxic 
threat from the East. It must also help in establishing alternative democratic 
institutions. For all the changes in the region, communists still control the 
governments. Now they are asking for grants of high-technology equipment and 
large sums of money to stop polluting their neighbors. But, as Polish 
human-rights and environmental leader Zbigniew Romaczewski recently told a 
gathering of Americans, "You have to work completely outside the old system. 
They will just spend your money and misuse the technology."
