The Senate on Friday approved a bill to allow state regulation of toxic waste 
dumps and landfills built on sovereign Indian lands such as the one proposed 
for Campo Reservation in southeast San Diego County. 
</P>
<P>
The bill, sponsored by Assemblyman Steve Peace (D-Rancho San Diego), was passed 
22 to 11 by the Senate and appeared headed for perfunctory approval in the 
Assembly late Friday before the end of the 1990 legislative session. 
</P>
<P>
Peace's measure was inspired by fears that a Campo Indian plan to build a 
600-acre landfill on their reservation would be exempt from state control, 
although neighbors claimed it could leak into their ground water. 
</P>
<P>
The Indians maintained that treaties and legal precedent leave them accountable 
to only the federal Environmental Protection Agency and the Bureau of Indian 
Affairs in building the private dump. 
</P>
<P>
But Peace persuaded his colleagues in the Assembly and Senate that the notion 
of Indian sovereignty is only being used as a smoke screen for out-of-state 
waste disposal companies to get around stricter California environmental laws. 
</P>
<P>
He and supporters of the bill argued that federal officials are lax at best in 
regulating the dumps, and that the state should impose its rules because Indian 
landfills could pose an environmental hazard to water and soil outside of 
reservation boundaries. 
</P>
<P>
On Friday, Peace continued to predict that his bill will be challenged in court 
by Indian tribes. "The point of the bill is to get ourselves in the best 
position to win the litigation," he said Friday. 
</P>
<P>
Peace's bill originally applied to all 117 Indian reservations and rancherias 
in California, but he changed that to win the support of Northern California 
legislators representing remote Indian lands. As passed Friday, it exempts 
Indian lands in 28 of the state's 59 counties. 
</P>
<P>
It also requires state regulation of a proposed landfill only if there is a 
finding that an Indian landfill could affect the environment or public health 
of those living outside of reservation boundaries. 
</P>
<P>
"I've been able to work out the opposition with everybody in California, 
including San Diego-based operators competing for the Campo site," Peace said. 
"That's got to tell you something about why these other operators have resisted 
it. They have different intentions than the local guys have." 
</P>
<P>
He added that opposition from Indians on his bill was "extorted" by out-of-town 
waste disposal companies who said they would withdraw their offers to build 
private landfills on the reservations if the bill passed. 
</P>
<P>
In the Campo case, the landfill represents a concerted effort by the small 
tribe to lift itself out of poverty, tribal representatives have said.
