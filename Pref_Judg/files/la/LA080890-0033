A controversial bill by Sen. Lucy Killea (D-San Diego) to make sure police 
personnel files are kept confidential during civil service hearings was 
sidetracked and essentially killed Tuesday by an Assembly committee. 
</P>
<P>
The Assembly's Public Service Committee refused to pass the measure and instead 
consigned it to an interim hearing to be held after the legislative session 
adjourns Aug. 31. 
</P>
<P>
That procedural move guarantees that the measure will not pass the Legislature 
this year, sending Killea back to square one in her attempt to guard the 
confidentiality of the police records. 
</P>
<P>
"This issue will not go away," Killea said Tuesday after the hearing. "The 
public is increasingly concerned about the actions of peace officers and has a 
right to know whether their law enforcement agencies respond appropriately to 
allegations of misconduct by an officer. 
</P>
<P>
"However, the enthusiasm to discover misconduct must be tempered with the 
respect of an individual's right to privacy and safety," said Killea. 
</P>
<P>
Killea's measure would make the police personnel records available to civilian 
review boards but seal them for civil service hearings, a provision that drew 
opposition from newspapers, the American Civil Liberties Union and the city of 
San Diego, which conducts its civil service hearings in public. 
</P>
<P>
The groups claimed that Killea's bill was an attempt to restrict the public's 
right to know about police personnel problems. 
</P>
<P>
However, Killea said her measure would require police departments to report 
statistics about police discipline and allow the personnel records to become 
public in civil or criminal court cases. The measure, she added, was designed 
to prevent newspapers from obtaining charges and testimony against police 
officers through what she claimed was the back door of civil service 
proceedings.
