David M. Kennedy's article "America Searches for Content in Heroes, in Values" 
(Opinion, July 8) echoed similar feelings in me. How is it we take our feelings 
for granted while foreigners tend to speak "with unabashed reverence about 
things like freedom and democracy?" They have "the discomforting habit of 
invoking our national icons and quoting our national heroes in defense of 
liberty." 
</P>
<P>
Is it so unsophisticated and simple-minded for us Americans to pay homage and 
worship our own native American heroes while we "lionize the visitors and not 
the locals"? 
</P>
<P>
If only the passionate crowds that greet our rock mega-stars and sports heroes 
would display such unabashed affection and enthusiasm for our own public heroes 
-- those who command and have earned our love and respect. 
</P>
<P>
Who are they? 
</P>
<P>
Men and women -- teachers, scientists, judges, senators, businessmen, painters, 
writers, etc., etc. 
</P>
<P>
Let us name them while they are still alive. Let's not wait until our national 
symbols have become "marbled figures turned into tourist attractions."
