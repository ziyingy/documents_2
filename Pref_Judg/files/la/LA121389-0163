Federal immigration authorities today levied a record $580,000 fine on a South 
Carolina textile company accused of hiring scores of illegal aliens, including 
children as young as 12. 
</P>
<P>
The administrative fine for Piedmont Quilting Corp. of Walhalla, S.C., is the 
largest under the 1986 law that contains criminal and civil penalties for 
knowingly employing illegal aliens, the Immigration and Naturalization Service 
said. 
</P>
<P>
The agency's announcement came a day after the company and 11 employees and 
executives were indicted in Greenville, S.C., on federal criminal charges 
related to the hiring of 117 illegal aliens from Mexico and Peru. 
</P>
<P>
The administrative fine covers the employment of 85 illegal aliens, the INS 
said. The fine also covers the company's failure to comply with procedures to 
verify that more than 400 employees were not illegal aliens, it said. 
</P>
<P>
"This is in defiance of the congressional mandate to prevent illegal aliens 
from obtaining employment in this country," INS Commissioner Gene McNary said 
in a statement. 
</P>
<P>
McNary said the agency's action "should be a clear sign to those who have any 
doubts that the Immigration and Naturalization Service is strongly committed to 
enforcing the employer sanctions" in the 1986 law. 
</P>
<P>
Federal agents raided the company last July in what was called the biggest 
crackdown on the employment of illegal aliens outside south Florida. 
</P>
<P>
Piedmont Quilting's attorney said the illegal aliens presented the company with 
false documentation in order to get hired.
