NASA rejected a suggestion by an independent safety panel that the agency 
cancel a $1.5-billion rocket development program and direct the money instead 
toward improvements in the space shuttle. The Aerospace Safety Advisory Panel 
said in its annual report that the National Aeronautics and Space 
Administration should abandon plans to build an advanced solid rocket motor 
because the money could be better used to make improvements in the orbiter 
stage of the space shuttle. But NASA Administrator James C. Fletcher said NASA 
wants to develop a second-source manufacturer for space shuttle solid rockets 
so the agency is never again left without a reliable rocket engine, as it was 
after the Challenger accident.
