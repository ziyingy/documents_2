The oil and auto industries, seeking to influence the outcome of Congress' 
debate over alternative motor fuels, today announced a joint program to test 
the pollution-cutting benefits of gasoline against methanol. 
</P>
<P>
Keith McHenry, senior vice president of technology at Amoco Corp., said the 
$11-million testing program would provide an "objective assessment" of the 
relative air quality benefits of methanol and new formulations of gasoline. 
</P>
<P>
The joint program, involving the Big Three auto companies and the 14 largest 
oil companies, is to begin immediately. A report on findings is due by next 
July or August. 
</P>
<P>
McHenry said too little was now known about the emission-reduction potential of 
methanol and reformulated gasoline for Congress and the states to make good 
decisions on policies aimed at curbing smog caused largely by burning fossil 
fuels.
