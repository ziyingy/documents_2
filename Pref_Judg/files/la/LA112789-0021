At least six people were killed on Los Angeles County roads and freeways as the 
Thanksgiving weekend drew to a close, including three family members in a 
pickup truck who were struck in a head-on collision with a compact car driven 
by a teen-age girl suspected of drunk driving, the California Highway Patrol 
reported Sunday.

At Los Angeles International Airport, officials prepared Sunday for peak 
road-clogging conditions as 250,000 travelers headed home after the holiday, 
the busiest travel period of the year. But by late Sunday evening, the expected 
traffic jam had not materialized.

"It's a lot lighter than we expected," said Lt. Ruben Martinez of the Airport 
Police Department. "We put on additional officers, but I don't think we're 
going to need them. I don't know where everybody is . . . they're not here." 
</P>
<P>
Statewide, the CHP and local police departments reported 53 traffic fatalities 
-- four less than last year -- between 6 p.m. Wednesday and 6 a.m. Sunday, the 
latest available figures. 
</P>
<P>
In addition, 451 people were arrested on suspicion of drunk driving in the 
county as part of the CHP's stepped-up holiday patrols on interstate highways.

The worst traffic collision in the county during the holiday weekend killed two 
men and a woman and injured 8 others, including a 17-year-old Azusa girl who 
was arrested on suspicion of felony drunk driving, in a spectacular head-on 
crash in La Puente, said California Highway Patrol Officer Andy Gutierrez. 
</P>
<P>
A 46-year-old La Puente man, a 38-year old Salinas man and a 70-year-old La 
Puente woman were killed in the cab of a Toyota pickup when the vehicle was 
stuck by the speeding compact car at Sunset Avenue and Amar Road about 9 p.m. 
Saturday, Gutierrez said.

<P>
The three dead and seven of the injured, who were sitting in the covered bed of 
the truck, were believed to be related. Officials declined to release 
identities pending notification of the next of kin. The seven, with minor to 
moderate injuries, were being treated at three nearby hospitals. 
</P>
<P>
The driver of the car, who was traveling south on Sunset at about 55 m.p.h., 
lost control of her car as she sped through a yellow traffic light and careened 
into the pickup, which was headed north, Gutierrez said. 
</P>
<P>
The identity of the girl, who was hospitalized with major injuries, was not 
released because of her age. 
</P>

Early Sunday morning, rain appeared to be the cause of two fatal accidents, the 
CHP reported, including one on a transition road between the Foothill and Simi 
Valley freeways and a second on the San Bernardino Freeway in East Los Angeles.

Travelers at LAX faced few traffic or parking troubles throughout the day 
Sunday, the culmination of a frenzied holiday weekend that saw 650,000 air 
passengers pass through the terminal gates, said airport spokesman Lee Nichols.

<P>
"I was prepared for the worst, but it really hasn't been that bad," said Judie 
Richards, 41, of Los Angeles, as she waved goodby to her Las Vegas-bound 
daughter on Sunday afternoon. 
</P>
<P>
Richards, who works as a reservations clerk for Northwest Airlines, said that 
she followed her own advice and showed up an hour and a half early for her 
daughter's 1 p.m. flight.

Airport police and parking officials said they were preparing for traffic 
backups along Century Boulevard and long lines at the exits from parking lots, 
a common sight on Thanksgiving weekends. 
</P>
<P>
About 25 additional parking clerks and 12 extra officers were on hand to keep 
traffic moving, Nichols said. 
</P>
<P>
However, traffic flowed smoothly on Century Boulevard, with only minor slowing 
at one of the airport's 10 terminals, airport police said.
