Lots of sunshine and low humidity, courtesy of a weak Santa Ana condition, are 
in store for San Diego this weekend, the National Weather Service says.

San Diegans may want to head outdoors to bask in the sunshine and enjoy the 
mild daytime temperatures seemingly tailor-made for outdoor sports. 
</P>
<P>
However, the nighttime lows are expected to get a bit chilly.

"There will be wide swings in the temperatures," forecaster Wilbur Shigehara 
said. "It looks like a nice weekend for outdoor activities. But, at night, it 
will be chilly enough to have frost inland and maybe a touch of frost near the 
beaches, but nothing too serious. Maybe some growers may want to do a touch of 
frost protection."

The sunshine and dry conditions with no storms in sight for at least the next 
week are a concern for water conservation, Shigehara said. Entering the third 
year of drought, forecasters are noticing that the current wind patterns are 
similar to the drought patterns of 1987-88.

"It's nice that we have lots of sunshine, but this is the time of the year that 
we have to accumulate rain," Shigehara said. "The early season rains have not 
done much. We are at a crucial time where we should receive a lot of rain. 
</P>
<P>
"This is the time we need rain. We are 20% behind schedule in rainfall (from) 
where we should be," he said. 
</P>
<P>
The weekend daytime temperatures are expected to fluctuate by only a few 
degrees.

The coastal regions will reach 63 to 68 degrees, with nighttime lows from 37 to 
45, Shigehara said. Inland highs will range 65 from 72, dropping to lows of 32 
to 40 degrees at night. Mountain areas are expected to hit 40 to 47 degrees 
during the day, falling to 20 to 30 at night. In the desert, highs of 65 to 72 
and lows of 32 to 40 are expected.

<P>
High temperatures for the beaches will be 57 to 62 today through Sunday, with 
lows in the 40s. Waves are expected to be 3 to 4 feet, with the water 
temperature at 54 degrees.
