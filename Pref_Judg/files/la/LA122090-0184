A furor has erupted in Philadelphia over an editorial by the city's respected 
morning newspaper advocating that poor black women be given "incentives" to use 
new long-term birth control implants. 
</P>
<P>
The editorial, which ran last week in the Philadelphia Inquirer, has spawned 
days of talk radio programs, pickets at the newspaper, and a teary-eyed staff 
meeting Monday in which journalists who grew up in poverty argued that their 
newspaper had advocated that they never be born. 
</P>
<P>
The uproar has also raised the issue of whether having ethnic diversity in 
newsrooms has any meaning if minority voices are ignored. 
</P>
<P>
On Wednesday the Inquirer's editorial board agreed to publish a second 
editorial acknowledging, in the words of editorial board chairman David Boldt, 
"that we were insensitive and counterproductive . . ." In the second editorial, 
the board would be "setting out (again) what we were trying to say," he said. 
</P>
<P>
The controversy began last Wednesday when the Inquirer published an editorial, 
"Poverty and Norplant -- Can Contraception Reduce the Underclass." 
</P>
<P>
It argued that "The main reason more black children are living in poverty is 
that the people having the most children are the ones least capable of 
supporting them. . . . There are many ways to fight back. . . . But it's very 
tough to undo the damage of being born into a dysfunctional family. So why not 
make a major effort to reduce the number of children, of any race, born into 
such circumstances." 
</P>
<P>
Internal reaction soon broke into print. "Hitler could have written the same 
editorial without pausing to breathe between sentences," wrote columnist Chuck 
Stone in the afternoon Philadelphia Daily News on Tuesday. Both the Daily News 
and the Inquirer are owned by the Knight-Ridder publishing company. 
</P>
<P>
The Inquirer's own metro page columnist Steve Lopez wrote on Sunday that the 
newsroom staff is "often embarrassed by what passes for this newspaper's 
voice," under the direction of Boldt and his deputy Donald Kimelman, the author 
of the editorial. 
</P>
<P>
The controversy dominated the radio talk show of Mary Mason for three days "I 
have been in talk radio for 33 years," said Mason, who is black. "I haven't had 
this kind of thing happen in a very long time." 
</P>
<P>
At the Inquirer, dozens of reporters and editors of all races who were upset 
over the editorial met twice with the paper's editor and the editorial board. 
</P>
<P>
Perhaps the most powerful moment came when Garry Howard, the Inquirer's 
31-year-old black assistant sports editor, spoke to Kimelman in Monday's 
session. Howard grew up in the Mitchell Projects of the south Bronx, one of six 
children in a broken home, raised by a welfare mother. 
</P>
<P>
After grammar school, Howard said, he won an academic scholarship to the 
prestigious Lawrenceville prep school in New Jersey. It was the same school, it 
turned out, from which Kimelman, the son of a U.S. ambassador to Haiti, had 
graduated 11 years earlier. 
</P>
<P>
"Here we are, we are colleagues, we work together, went to same prep school," 
Howard recalled saying. "And the summation of the editorial is that poor women 
on welfare shouldn't have been having so many babies, or that I shouldn't have 
been born." 
</P>
<P>
"I know I am the exception," Howard said in an interview. "But without the 
exception there is no hope. And that is what everyone is entitled to, the 
chance to reach the highest height they can." 
</P>
<P>
Several people cried during the course of the meeting. "I came out of it 
shellshocked," Boldt said. 
</P>
<P>
Part of the depth of the uproar, staff members said, is that the editorial 
seemed to reflect the so-called "neo-liberal" ideology and the provocative 
style of the board under Boldt, who has run the paper's editorial pages for 
three years. 
</P>
<P>
Kimelman and Boldt in fact had written a similar editorial about Norplant on 
Nov. 1, but did not refer to race. 
</P>
<P>
When the second, more pointed editorial was written, at least one editorial 
writer, Rick Nichols, "argued vociferously" against running it. "I think you 
can discuss these kinds of questions," Nichols said, but he complained that the 
editorial made it sound as though high birth rates were the cause of the 
decline of the inner city, rather than a host of other complicated problems. 
</P>
<P>
"By failing to at least allude to this host of problems," Nichols said, "we put 
the blame (on the victim) and that is precisly what David Duke does." Duke is 
the former Ku Klux Klansman and Senate candidate who is currently a member of 
the Louisiana Legislature. 
</P>
<P>
The situation was made worse by an exchange of messages between critics and the 
editorial's sponsors, Kimelman and Boldt. Kimelman wrote to one colleague: 
</P>
<P>
"I'm told David Duke has said similar things. . . . Does this make me ashamed. 
No. It helps explain to me why David Duke, in his post-klan incarnation, is 
getting so many votes. He talks publicly about stuff the rest of us only 
reserve for our private conversations." 
</P>
<P>
Black members of the editorial board alleged that their views were being 
deliberately ignored, particularly on issues of poverty, race and urban 
decline, which Boldt and Kimelman said have become a specialty of the editorial 
page. 
</P>
<P>
Claude Lewis, one of three black members of the editorial board, even stopped 
attending meetings "several months ago" in protest. 
</P>
<P>
Lorraine Branham, another black editorial board member said in an interview 
that, "Whenever we raise (criticisms of their views on poverty and race) there 
is a feeling that 'you can't be objective about this because you are black.' We 
make this big argument at the Inquirer about ethnic diversity, but it does 
absolutely no good if no one listens to what you say." 
</P>
<P>
Max King, the Inquirer editor since only last summer, now admits that running 
the editorial was a mistake. 
</P>
<P>
But he said he has no plans to follow the recommendation of a minority group of 
staff to replace Boldt.
