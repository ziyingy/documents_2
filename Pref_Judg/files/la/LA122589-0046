The editors of Science magazine have for the first time chosen a "Molecule of 
the Year," representative of the most significant scientific achievement. The 
first winner is an enzyme called DNA polymerase that can be used in the 
laboratory for making large quantities of any particular piece of DNA 
(deoxyribonucleic acid, the genetic blueprint of life) through a process known 
as polymerase chain reaction or PCR.

PCR is revolutionizing genetic engineering by enabling scientists to make large 
amounts of DNA without resorting to the techniques that created the field in 
the first place: inserting a gene into bacteria, growing large quantities of 
the bacteria, and then isolating the desired DNA. While replicating DNA in 
bacteria can require weeks or months, PCR makes replication possible in hours.

The new technique has made it possible to perform genetic fingerprinting on 
single hairs or single cells. It has also been widely used in the search for 
disease-causing genes and in the production of new biological chemicals through 
genetic engineering.
