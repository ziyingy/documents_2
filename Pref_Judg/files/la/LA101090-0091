Matsushita Electric Industrial Co.'s participation in an Arab-led boycott of 
Israel could complicate its efforts to purchase MCA Inc., whose chairman, Lew 
R. Wasserman, is one of Hollywood's leading supporters of Jewish and Israeli 
causes. 
</P>
<P>
Matsushita's policy, which has not been widely publicized, bars the Japanese 
electronics giant from conducting any direct trade with Israel. That policy 
would technically prevent Matsushita from selling MCA's movies and television 
shows to Israel. But U.S. law forbids American companies, even those owned by 
foreign firms, to comply with the boycott. 
</P>
<P>
Executives from both MCA and Matsushita declined to comment on the policy. One 
individual familiar with the talks said MCA won't change its policy of dealing 
with Israel even if acquired by Matsushita, but neither does it plan to end the 
talks because of Matsushita's stance. Other individuals said Matsushita 
executives, queried about the boycott, have shown no willingness to end their 
participation in the boycott. 
</P>
<P>
Leading Jewish activists, however, said that unless the sanctions are lifted, 
Wasserman will be quietly pressured to get out of the deal, which could be 
worth more than $8 billion. 
</P>
<P>
"We're talking about a mega-deal," said Jess Hordes, Washington director of 
B'nai B'rith's Anti-Defamation League. "It would not be inappropriate for Mr. 
Wasserman or any corporate executive to explore the implications of the 
boycott. We'll try to alert him to the possible problems that could be created 
linking up with a company with this kind of policy." 
</P>
<P>
Jewish activists said Matsushita, based in Osaka, has been a loyal adherent of 
the Arab boycott, which also prohibits the electronics firm from opening stores 
or production facilities in Israel. Failure to follow the restrictions, in 
effect since 1951, can result in economic reprisals. 
</P>
<P>
Other companies around the world also participate in the boycott, which is 
designed to weaken Israel's economy. But Jewish leaders say the Japanese are 
particularly cooperative, presumably because of their country's heavy reliance 
on oil from Arab nations. Toyota, Nissan, Hitachi, Minolta and Olympus are 
among the other major Japanese firms that honor the boycott, according to 
Jewish organizations, such as the B'nai B'rith Anti-Defamation League and the 
American Jewish Congress, that monitor a list maintained by the Israeli 
government. 
</P>
<P>
The Matsushita name was little known to the American public until the company 
began discussing a bid to buy Los Angeles-based MCA, which owns Universal 
Studios, theme parks, real estate, record labels and other interests. 
Matsushita, whose products are sold under the Panasonic, Technics and JVC 
labels, reported profits of $1.6 billion on sales of $44 billion last fiscal 
year. 
</P>
<P>
Will Maslow, special counsel to the American Jewish Congress and editor of the 
group's monthly Boycott Report, said Matsushita's Panasonic products are widely 
available in Israel but only through third-party American distributors. 
</P>
<P>
Other Japanese companies have more boldly sidestepped the boycott. Honda sells 
cars in Israel through its American division. Sony Corp., which purchased 
Columbia Pictures Entertainment Corp. for $3.4 billion last year, sells its 
products directly out of a store in Tel Aviv. 
</P>
<P>
Japanese-Israeli relations have gradually improved in recent years. The two 
countries agreed to explore possible economic and technological collaboration 
late last year after then-Israeli Foreign Minister Moshe Arens made a rare 
five-day visit to Japan. But the boycott issue remains as a sore point, 
especially among Jewish activists living in the United States. 
</P>
<P>
Maslow's Washington-based Boycott Report regularly monitors changes in policy. 
Several Jewish organizations in Los Angeles have also recently organized around 
the boycott issue. A position paper from the groups names Japan as "the worst 
offender" of any industrialized nation. Members have been encouraged to engage 
in an anti-boycott letter-writing campaign. 
</P>
<P>
American companies have been barred from participating in the boycott since 
1977 under the federal Export-Import Act of that year. "(Violators) are subject 
to, I believe, both criminal and civil penalties. . . . That's fairly 
straightforward," UCLA international law professor Arthur Rosett said of the 
U.S. anti-boycott rules. The United States is Israel's biggest international 
trading partner. 
</P>
<P>
Jewish leaders may be hesitant to directly challenge Wasserman, however. At 77, 
the MCA chairman is a revered figure in the Jewish and Israeli communities. One 
Jewish leader in Southern California said Wasserman is a significant 
contributor to such causes as the United Jewish Fund, an umbrella humanitarian 
organization, and Operation Exodus, which helps Russian Jews emigrate to 
Israel. 
</P>
<P>
MCA President Sidney J. Sheinberg is also a substantial contributor to Jewish 
causes, as is Creative Artists Agency Chairman Michael Ovitz, who has served as 
Matsushita's representative in its talks with MCA. Those ties have led to some 
discomfort in Hollywood as word of Matsushita's Israeli sanctions have leaked 
out. But thus far it is difficult to determine what impact the revelation will 
have on the purchase discussions. 
</P>
<P>
Both Sheinberg and Ovitz declined to comment. 
</P>
<P>
Some Jewish leaders said it is quite possible that Wasserman, Sheinberg and 
Ovitz knew nothing of the anti-Israeli policy when they entered into the 
discussions. MCA now appears prepared to take the position that the boycott 
won't affect the acquisition talks. 
</P>
<P>
Privately, the current company line is that the studio won't stop doing 
business with Israel even if acquired by Matsushita, but neither will it kill a 
deal over the parent company's stance. 
</P>
<P>
"Their corporate politics at Matsushita won't have any effect on MCA's 
politics," one individual familiar with the talks predicted. 
</P>
<P>
One longtime Wasserman friend, informed of Matsushita's boycott, predicted that 
the deal is more likely to be jeopardized by Japanese sensitivity to renewed 
attention to the boycott than by any reaction at MCA. "It's the Japanese 
company that may say, 'Who needs this?' . . . They are very sensitive to the 
way they're perceived in the U.S." 
</P>
<P>
MCA has continued to enforce a blackout on the talks. The company's top 
officers had been scheduled to meet Matsushita executives in New York last 
Sunday. But several individuals close to the company speculated that 
face-to-face meetings had been shifted to Los Angeles and might be under way 
already with Matsushita representatives, if not its president, Akio Tanii. 
</P>
<P>
MCA stock fell $2.75 a share Tuesday to close at $56.125 as 567,900 shares 
changed hands in New York Stock Exchange trading. Analysts said the decline 
reflected a weak market and a lack of information about MCA's talks with 
Matsushita. 
</P>
<P>
"I think it's (professional speculators) getting nervous about a lack of 
information flow," said Lisbeth Barron, an entertainment analyst with S. G. 
Warburg Group in New York. 
</P>
<P>
Whatever the course of the discussions, however, it is apparent that 
Matsushita's boycott policy will now be among the items on the table. Rabbi 
Laura Geller of the American Jewish Congress in Los Angeles said it's a 
legitimate issue for MCA. 
</P>
<P>
"People would love MCA to use this opportunity to perhaps raise questions about 
these larger issues," Geller said. 
</P>
<P>
"Groups like ours continue to remind Japanese business that there should be no 
barriers to free and open trade between nations, and we will continue to do so 
until all such barriers disappear," said Neil Sandberg of the American Jewish 
Committee's Pacific Rim Institute. "The point will be raised that (Matsushita) 
should freely and openly trade with Israel."
