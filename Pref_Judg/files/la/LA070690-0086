Exuberance was the order of the day at the graduate fashion shows for Los 
Angeles Trade-Technical College and the Fashion Institute of Design and 
Merchandising. The shows encompassed everything from vampish voguing to the 
spirit of glasnost.

Restaurateur and school alumni Mario Tamayo hosted the show at the Los Angeles 
Trade-Technical College. He opened it by sashaying down the runway with an 
entourage of students modeling avant-garde creations to the tune of "When the 
Saints Come Marching In."

Nighthawk Tamayo paused during the fast-paced presentation to put in his bid 
for evening wear: "obviously my personal favorite."

During its 63-year history, the school has produced some of California's most 
successful designers -- Carole Little, Robin Piccone, Bill Whitten and Tadashi

designers and manufacturers.

decorated with gold studs, Maria Tsuji for her green corduroy coat and tunic 
over a black bodysuit, Grace Motamedi for her ivory wrap dress and ivory and

Soviet Union, here to discuss business opportunities.

Hollywood costume and ready-to-wear designer Bob Mackie was a guest. "Most 
students try to be practical and gear their way into sportswear," he said. "But 
every now and then, there's some wild person who comes to see me -- and that's 
nice."

Richard Magnanti, from the school's theater costume program, showed a whimsical 
twist on hats, tying up a hat box-sized hat with a taffeta bow to resemble a 
gift box.
