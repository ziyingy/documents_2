Your May 27 News and Briefs column made the following statement: "Last summer, 
the United States advised citizens against traveling to Kenya after two 
Americans were killed in an attack on a tourist bus. It has not rescinded the 
advice, despite high-level appeals. 
</P>
<P>
Nor is it likely to, the diplomats said, until Kenya offers proof of a 
reduction in crimes against tourists." 
</P>
<P>
The U.S. State Department Travel Advisory relates certain incidents and 
suggests certain precautions in particular areas of Kenya when traveling there. 
However, under no reading does it advise U.S. citizens against traveling to 
Kenya. 
</P>
<P>
For your information, since the poacher attack in June, 1989, there have been 
no reported injuries to tourists in Kenya, since the Kenyan government -- 
through its recently appointed director of wildlife -- has virtually eliminated 
the poachers (who had been the source of the attacks) from the wildlife parks. 
</P>
<P>
Tens of thousands of American tourists have indeed traveled to Kenya within the 
last year and experienced a safe, relaxed and enjoyable vacation.
