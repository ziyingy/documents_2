Police arrested three of 15 Jehovah's Witnesses who surrounded the hospital bed 
of a church member to keep doctors from giving blood transfusions to the woman 
for complications after childbirth, officials said.

Denise Nicoleau and her husband, Herriot, refused the transfusions on religious 
grounds Friday, and a Brookhaven Memorial Hospital official obtained a court 
order to administer them.

The three arrested, including Herriot Nicoleau, were charged with second-degree 
criminal trespass. Then the woman received the first transfusion, police said.
