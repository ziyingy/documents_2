<P>
IT WAS JUST before sunset one scorching late summer day when we stumbled on a 
rare slice of the real Iraq. 
</P>
<P>
We were just off Al-Rashid Street in central Baghdad, but out of range of 
Iraq's Information Ministry guides, who have steered hundreds of reporters 
through one of the world's most highly disciplined police states since Iraq 
made itself ground zero in the Persian Gulf crisis. The conventional wisdom was 
that the real Iraq was wherever the guides were not. So on that hot September 
evening, Thomas and I were on an unescorted "reality hunt" through some of the 
narrow, dilapidated lanes in the bowels of Baghdad. 
</P>
<P>
Thomas, a young student from Germany, knew Baghdad inside and out -- in fact, 
far better than he had hoped to when he crossed the Syrian border into Iraq in 
a crowded bus on July 29 as a backpacking student of Islam and the Arabic 
language. Four days after Thomas arrived, Saddam Hussein invaded Kuwait. A few 
days later, the United States rushed its troops, ships and planes to the gulf, 
the world isolated Iraq, which promptly sealed its borders, and 22-year-old 
Thomas suddenly found himself a prisoner in his laboratory, part of Hussein's 
human insurance policy against the prospect of oblivion. 
</P>
<P>
But unlike most of the other foreigners detained in Iraq, who have been free to 
go anywhere except through the immigration booth at Saddam International 
Airport, Thomas had not been idle. He was biding his time by doing exactly what 
he came to do -- study Iraq, speak its language and try to understand. He was a 
genuine guide. 
</P>
<P>
And so it was that Thomas and I found ourselves on Al-Rashid Street in his 
favorite bookshop, a tiny cubicle of a place run by one of Thomas' many 
friends. It was surprising, at first, to find so many books on the shelves. 
During another reality hunt a few weeks before, at another bookstore, even the 
shop owner nervously joined in our laughter when we discovered that his House 
of Wisdom Book Store in fact had not a single volume in stock. In Saddam 
Hussein's Iraq, where censorship is written into the constitution as an 
inalienable right of the state, such apparent contradictions are common. 
</P>
<P>
But the shop owned by Thomas' friend was packed floor to ceiling with books and 
pamphlets -- Arabic-language textbooks, science, math and English texts and 
propaganda treatises issued by Hussein's all-powerful Arab Baath Socialist 
Party. One shelf was filled with dogeared and yellowing English-language 
romance novels, but they had little to do with reality even in the West. In the 
center of them all, one clue to the real Iraq stood out. 
</P>
<P>
The title was in Arabic, but there was no mistaking the large, black-and-white 
photograph on the cover. It was Adolf Hitler -- and the book was "Mein Kampf." 
</P>
<P>
"Why are you surprised?" the bookshop owner asked with genuine confusion when 
he noticed my stunned expression. He had been talking with Thomas about a town 
he'd once visited in Germany. 
</P>
<P>
"Well," I said, "it's only because George Bush, Margaret Thatcher and almost 
every other Western leader have been making such a big deal out of comparing 
your president to Adolf Hitler -- you know, the guy who gasses his own people 
and tries to take over the world?" 
</P>
<P>
The shop owner smiled knowingly. He walked over to the shelf, removed the book 
with Hitler's photograph almost reverently and placed it on the counter. 
</P>
<P>
"You Americans will never understand us," he said softly. " 'Mein Kampf ' is 
one of my biggest sellers. It's a brilliant work by a powerful man. Hitler was 
a strong man, and we Iraqis admire strength. He fought to rid the world of the 
Jews, and, as you know, we are still at war with Israel. But Hitler also had a 
vision for the future, and he followed that vision straight through his life. 
Hitler was a great man." 
</P>
<P>
Thomas and I listened in amazement. The shop owner paused, regarding our blank 
expressions. "You in the West just don't get it. Here in Iraq, we like Hitler. 
Hitler sells." 
</P>
<P>
PENETRATING SADDAM Hussein's Iraq is like breaking into a maximum-security 
prison. Brief moments like those in the bookshop offer an outsider the hope 
that, with enough real Iraqis voicing enough real thoughts, an accurate mosaic 
of the real Iraq might emerge. But such moments are rare. 
</P>
<P>
Since taking power 11 years ago, the Iraqi leader has methodically constructed 
a monolithic order so relentlessly efficient in its promotion of strength, 
discipline and the cult of Saddamism that even Adolf Hitler would have admired 
it. Even before he engineered sole control of the presidency in 1979, Hussein, 
as second in command, laid the foundations for a three-tiered security 
apparatus that has been largely responsible for keeping him not only in power 
but alive. 
</P>
<P>
There are the Amn, the civilian state security bureau trained by the Soviet 
KGB; the Estikhbarat, the military intelligence wing that protects Iraqis and 
their interests abroad, and the Mukhabarat, the dreaded Baath intelligence 
network that is so autonomous it even spies on the other two. The Mukhabarat's 
vast web is believed to include at least one agent on every block of every 
street in every city, town and village of Iraq. For Iraqis, a wrong thought 
voiced at the wrong moment means certain imprisonment -- or death. 
</P>
<P>
But aside from institutionalized mortal fear, there's another, more complex, 
facet to this self-professed assassin's hold on his 17 million people. And to 
understand that is to appreciate the fundamental contradictions in Iraq's 
history. 
</P>
<P>
Even the nation's name defies logic. Iraq is Arabic for "the well-rooted 
country." The name was given in the 7th Century to a place in roughly the spot 
Iraq now occupies. It was fairly accurate at the time. It was meant to honor 
the land known as Mesopotamia, home to the first known human civilization. But 
Iraq didn't refer to an actual country until 1932, when the British washed 
their hands of it, leaving behind a friendly monarchy and borders drawn 
deliberately to keep Iraq weak by denying it direct access to the sea. That was 
merely the final act in a centuries-long drama of war and conquest that saw the 
land invaded, splintered, annexed, spliced, splintered again and finally 
respliced in the 20th Century. 
</P>
<P>
After the monarchy was overthrown in 1958, Iraq was wracked by revolution after 
revolution, the last of which was a bloodless coup staged by the Baath Party in 
1968. Once in power, Hussein liberated the Iraqis from their humiliating past. 
Spurred initially by a strong sense of Iraqi nationalism -- his own and his 
countrymen's -- he later capitalized on that pride to perpetuate his rule. But 
at what price? ask those familiar with the brutalities of Iraqi life. 
</P>
<P>
"These are people in a mental straitjacket," observed one diplomat who speaks 
Arabic and has lived in Baghdad for more than a year but who, like many Western 
diplomats here, remains deeply frustrated by the Iraqis' unwillingness to so 
much as invite him into their homes, let alone speak their innermost thoughts. 
"There's only one brain in this country, and he thinks for everybody. But he's 
only 36% human," the diplomat added, "so what has developed here is a truly 
self-policing society. Despite the obvious police state, people aren't really 
afraid of the knock on the door anymore because they know they've done nothing 
wrong. They've been totally conditioned. They haven't even allowed themselves 
the luxury of thinking wrong." 
</P>
<P>
Iraqis are taught what to think, what to say and how to behave. And that 
process starts very early. 
</P>
<P>
"DOWN, DOWN, BOOSH! Down, down, Boosh!" a little voice was shouting from 
somewhere deep within the crowd of well-dressed women and children protesting 
outside the U.S. Embassy in Baghdad's affluent Al-Mansour neighborhood. 
</P>
<P>
When it fell silent, another started up: "No for war! No for war!" And then 
another: "We love Saddam! We love Saddam!" 
</P>
<P>
Several American television crews pushed through the sea of placards, searching 
for the source of the voices. Finally, a helpful Information Ministry guide 
produced one of them, sorting through a thicket of legs and pulling out a 
dark-haired boy, scrawny but well-groomed. 
</P>
<P>
"His name is Naja," the guide explained. "He's 9, maybe 8, years old. And he 
speaks English. He is a very bright boy. Ask him a question. Ask him anything." 
</P>
<P>
"Why are you here?" someone asked the smiling boy as the cameras rolled. 
</P>
<P>
"To tell Boosh we don't want war." 
</P>
<P>
"Why don't you want war?" the guide asked voluntarily. 
</P>
<P>
"Because we want peace." 
</P>
<P>
"Who brought you here today?" a television reporter asked. 
</P>
<P>
"My mother." 
</P>
<P>
"Why?" 
</P>
<P>
"To tell Boosh all Iraqis want peace. To tell Boosh we want food and medicine. 
To tell Boosh we love Saddam Hussein." 
</P>
<P>
"Do you know who Boosh is?" another reporter asked. 
</P>
<P>
Suddenly young Naja appeared to be stumped. He looked up blankly at the 
Information Ministry guide, who smiled sheepishly at the journalists and then 
turned sternly back to the boy, whispering in Arabic, "Boosh is president of 
America. Tell them." 
</P>
<P>
With renewed confidence, Naja almost bellowed, "Boosh is president of America. 
He takes away our milk. He takes away our medicine. No for war! No for war!" 
</P>
<P>
The demonstration was an orchestrated event, listed that morning as "Iraqi 
Children Protest at U. S. Embassy" on the marquee beside the Information 
Ministry's permanent desk in the lobby of the Ishtar Sheraton. The Sheraton is 
one of several luxury hotels that have been home to foreign journalists who, as 
the number of foreign diplomats dwindles, have served as the world's eyes and 
ears inside Iraq since the gulf crisis erupted. That evening, virtually every 
international television network covering the morning protest included footage 
of the event in its gulf roundup. 
</P>
<P>
"Do you really hate America?" a few of us asked one of the protesting mothers 
during one of the rare, brief moments when the guides were out of earshot. 
</P>
<P>
"America? America good. Very good," she said, as her children shouted 
anti-American slogans. "We like America. Just Boosh. Boosh no good." 
</P>
<P>
THE GOOD BAATHIST runs quickly and well through a mine field; your weapon 
against the mines is your education," Hussein once told his comrades at a party 
meeting. "You will be able to defuse the bombs if you are equipped with the 
principles of your party and with education." 
</P>
<P>
Since taking power, Hussein's ministries of education and information have 
rewritten most textbooks to reflect not only the Baath Party's ideological 
underpinnings but also Hussein's own vision: The map is wrong, borders do not 
exist, the Arab nations should be one country with one leader. The clear 
implication is that Hussein would take charge. 
</P>
<P>
On the first day of school this year -- two months after the mid-summer 
conquest of Kuwait -- children in every geography class in every city, village 
and town of Iraq found themselves drawing new maps of their nation that 
included a province once known as the nation of Kuwait. In history class, too, 
the lessons were changed. The new party line went like this: Kuwait is and 
always had been a part of Iraq. There never really was a country called Kuwait. 
</P>
<P>
Outside Baghdad's largest mosque one Friday as the imam bellowed the holy day's 
sermon through the minaret's loudspeakers, a friend and I came across a young 
soft-drink vendor in a ragged T-shirt. His stock included cans of Coca-Cola 
marked "Made in Kuwait" and priced in Kuwaiti currency, plundered goods that, 
along with food smuggled from Turkey and Iran, have helped Iraq so far 
withstand the United Nations embargo imposed in August. 
</P>
<P>
The boy looked deeply puzzled when we asked, "Wasn't this part of all the stuff 
that Iraq looted from Kuwait?" 
</P>
<P>
"Looted?" the boy asked, nonplussed. "We own Kuwait. Kuwait is a part of Iraq. 
This is Iraqi Coke." 
</P>
<P>
But while rewriting the history and geography of the world illustrates the 
broad reach of Hussein's indoctrination, it also highlights Iraq's deep-seated 
isolation. 
</P>
<P>
Young Naja, for instance, knew the right word to use for the American 
president. Boosh,as Iraqi government newscasters deliberately pronounce 
President Bush's name hundreds of times a day in radio and television 
broadcasts, is actually the Arabic word for "nothing" or, in its more 
derogatory meaning on Baghdad streets, "an empty hole." But clearly, Naja 
didn't associate the name with the American President himself. When later asked 
to name the U. S. President, Naja again shrugged his shoulders and looked 
around for the Information Ministry guide. 
</P>
<P>
It was a telling moment, according to the diplomats remaining in town. "Sounds 
to me like that boy and Saddam Hussein have a lot in common," one said when he 
heard about Naja. "I'm sure Saddam knows George Bush's name, but he probably 
doesn't know a whole lot more about him that that. And this is the crux of the 
whole problem. 
</P>
<P>
"Iraq has become so isolated under Saddam Hussein that the Iraqi people no 
longer have a real understanding of what the outside world is all about. And 
that applies to Saddam Hussein, as well -- especially to him." 
</P>
<P>
THE SCREEN ON the large television set inside the U. S. Embassy went blank for 
a moment, then the familiar logo appeared at the top of the picture: "Guest 
News," it declared. Quickly, the handful of embassy diplomats and the six U. S. 
Marines who still remained in Baghdad gathered around to watch. 
</P>
<P>
Since the gulf crisis began, "Guest News" has been a nightly feature on 
state-run Iraqi Television. Officials in the Information Ministry describe it 
as a humanitarian show that gives Saddam Hussein's "special guests" -- the 
hostages held under strict military guard at strategic targets throughout the 
country -- an opportunity to send video messages to family and friends in the 
outside world. But this night was different. Tonight, Hussein was the star of 
the show. 
</P>
<P>
Dressed in a fine gray suit and tie, the Iraqi president appeared in a modern, 
cavernous conference room ringed by about two dozen hostages from the United 
States, Britain and France -- the people he believes are guarding his nation 
against a U. S. air strike. It was Hussein's second "Rocky Horror Hostage 
Show," as one person in the U. S. Embassy's TV room dubbed it. Two weeks 
before, during a worldwide broadcast, he had ignited an international furor by 
hugging and patting on the head a young British boy named Stuart Lockwood. And 
here was Hussein again, patting young girls on the cheek and running his hands 
through their hair. 
</P>
<P>
"Ugh! Christ Almighty!" shouted one of the Marines watching that night as he 
fell to the floor, sprawled flat on his back with his arms outstretched toward 
the sky. "C'mon, you guys. Here it is. Ground zero. Drop the nuke on my 
coordinates." 
</P>
<P>
Hussein went on with his 90-minute show, devoting an hour to a speech that 
included what aides later said the Iraqi president considered to be a heartfelt 
apology to the hostages. 
</P>
<P>
"From a human point of view, I am in as much pain as you are," he told them in 
Arabic. "Let me say how painful for me it is to see a situation come about that 
has put you where you are now. I wish that your stay in a manner of forced 
hospitality, let us say, will not be long." (Access to the strategic sites was 
prohibited, however, so no one knew then how detainees were being treated. It 
was only after some French hostages were freed in October that harsh conditions 
-- some Americans were said to be near the breaking point -- were reported.) 
</P>
<P>
Then, an extraordinary thing happened. Hussein admitted how little he 
understood about his "guests" -- and their politicians and nations. He 
announced that he was utterly confounded by the outrage in the West after his 
previous hostage show. 
</P>
<P>
"I read that they were annoyed with me," Hussein said. "I don't see why they 
should be annoyed." And then, he added his own interpretation of that 
"annoyance" -- a classic illustration of how Hussein's personal alienation from 
the West has layered misunderstanding upon misunderstanding in the last 3 1/2 
months. "It seems to me these officials were annoyed with my meeting with the 
British people because they don't want the facts to be told, except through 
them and on their own channels. . . ." 
</P>
<P>
Soon after, the Marines announced with a string of unprintable curses that they 
wanted to switch Hussein's channel off, then left to have a few beers. 
</P>
<P>
SADDAM-WATCHING, as it has been called by some in Iraq, was the favorite and 
most perplexing pursuit of the diplomatic corps in Baghdad. Critical clues in 
the reality hunt, the diplomats' perceptions have helped to form not only U. S. 
policy in the gulf crisis but also the images of Iraq appearing in the tens of 
thousands of column inches of newspaper reports that have been published and 
the hundreds of hours of American television coverage that have aired since 
Aug. 2. Where the diplomats -- a mixed bag of Arabists and career bureaucrats 
from virtually every nation of the world -- were free to speculate, the Iraqis 
were afraid to think. 
</P>
<P>
But in the diplomats' necessarily prismatic view, there was only one facet of 
Hussein's character on which all of them seemed to agree. It is that this 
strong-willed, ironfisted man, who has stamped his own image on an entire 
nation in just over a decade, has gleaned virtually all of his knowledge of the 
Western world from books and advisers. With the exception of a single trip to 
France years ago, Hussein, 53, is believed to have never set foot outside the 
Arab world. 
</P>
<P>
"He never really visited the West, and, you know, Hitler, too, never visited 
the outside world," a German diplomat said. "With Saddam, it's the same as 
Ceaucescu or Hitler. No one is telling him the real information." Which, he 
added, relates directly to Hussein's invasion of Kuwait. 
</P>
<P>
"I believe Saddam miscalculated the whole thing because his picture of the 
world is a little bit different from reality," the diplomat continued. "Before 
the invasion, he got the information filtered. And so, since he had no frame of 
reference of his own on how the West would react, he went ahead with it. It was 
a mistake, and I think he realizes it was a mistake." 
</P>
<P>
"Well, I think he's brilliant," said another diplomat in another embassy. "He's 
a brilliant strategist -- very good at keeping his opponents off guard. As much 
as he is in a corner, he has placed the rest of the world in a corner as well." 
</P>
<P>
But then, that same diplomat quickly caught himself. He was born and raised in 
a democratic Western nation where men like Hitler and Hussein don't play too 
well. "Look, I would hate to say anything good about Saddam. He's a vicious 
man. He's frighteningly brutal. He would happily sacrifice half his people to 
take on the rest of the world. He has gassed his own people. He has sent 
everybody's sons to war. 
</P>
<P>
"It's just that when you live here long enough, you begin to understand and 
appreciate not only the perspective of Saddam but of the millions of people who 
still do support him here. People should not distinguish too much between the 
way Saddam Hussein does things and the way the Iraqis do things. There simply 
isn't that much difference." 
</P>
<P>
"BASTARD!" SCREAMED my taxi driver after a battered, white-and-yellow taxi cut 
him off in heavy traffic. "Do it again and I'll tear your heart out!" he 
shouted out the window as we sped down a palm-lined boulevard, dodging the 
potholes that have multiplied as sanctions have begun to wear down Baghdad's 
once-efficient infrastructure. 
</P>
<P>
Two blocks later, the same taxi driver deliberately swerved into our path. 
</P>
<P>
"One more time, and I'll smash your bones to dust!" my driver yelled, this time 
with so much force that I thought he would crush the steering wheel instead. 
</P>
<P>
The other taxi driver flipped his hand at us as if he was swatting a fly, and, 
sure enough, a few minutes later, he cut us off again. My driver had been 
nothing but sweet and soft-spoken all day, but now his kindly face twisted into 
something that resembled a rubber Halloween mask. His fingers gripped the wheel 
like metal vises, and he pushed his right foot to the floor with his entire 
body behind it. The car lurched forward. We careened down the road, and my 
driver didn't stop until we sideswiped the taxi, forcing it onto the sidewalk 
and into a telephone pole. 
</P>
<P>
In an instant, the madness drained from my driver's face. Then he leaned out 
the window in the direction of the other driver, who was busy looking for his 
door, and said, "Sorry, but I warned you." 
</P>
<P>
This incident, similar to accidents that occur frequently on the crowded 
thoroughfares of Baghdad, provided an almost too-perfect metaphor. A few days 
afterward, I found myself chatting with the same diplomat who had called 
Hussein brilliant. "It's like I said," he told me this time. "The Iraqi style 
is they warn you, they warn you again, they might even warn you again, and then 
they hit you -- hard." 
</P>
<P>
Another diplomat shared the same perspective of 
Kuwait-invasion-as-traffic-accident: "The last thing you want to do in this 
situation is what that taxi driver did. Don't provoke, and don't push Saddam 
into a corner. The worst kind of situation is the one that exists here today -- 
where no one's willing to talk to Saddam. Push him too far, and he's the kind 
of guy who'll opt for driving you off the road. And, in this case, I'm afraid 
that's Armageddon." 
</P>
<P>
On the surface, it may seem that these particular diplomats had been in Baghdad 
too long. But their theory was validated by the Iraqis themselves. 
</P>
<P>
NAJI AL-HADITHI'S spacious corner office on the eighth floor of Iraq's Ministry 
of Information and Culture is an oasis of Western sophistication in the heart 
of Baghdad -- at least on the surface. There are photocopiers, a fax machine, 
half a dozen telephones, an intercom system, a wide-screen television set and 
well-equipped kitchen for the many late nights that Iraq's director general of 
information and culture has spent here. 
</P>
<P>
The office has served as Al-Hadithi's command post since early August, when 
fears of all-out war gave way to a military stalemate in which image and 
information were the only effective weapons. Al-Hadithi, who was Iraq's senior 
press attache in London during the mid-'70s and who edits the Baghdad Observer, 
Iraq's only English-language newspaper, had all the makings of a brilliant 
field general for this battle. He was among the few senior Iraqi officials with 
an intimate understanding of the Western media, and he was fiercely loyal to 
the Iraqi leader. 
</P>
<P>
Once inside Al-Hadithi's office, the superficial trappings of the West melt 
away into a strange and separate reality. It begins with small details, such as 
the paperweight beside the imported TV. It was one of those glass bubbles 
similar to the ones with snow that swirls when you shake them. But inside 
Al-Hadithi's paperweight, there was only reddish sand, with a small Iraqi flag 
planted in the center. The inscription read, "The earth of Al Faw mixed with 
the blood of Iraqi martyrs" -- a commemoration of the battles for the strategic 
Iraqi city in which at least 52,000 Iraqis and as many as 100,000 Iranians died 
during the 1980-1988 war with Iran. 
</P>
<P>
"We have to tell the world that we are powerful and that we can destroy all the 
allied forces that are here," Al-Hadithi explained. "This should be made clear 
to everybody to give people second thoughts about attacking Iraq. They have a 
goal. Their goal is to end something called Iraq. And we have a goal -- to 
survive." 
</P>
<P>
With his genteel style and American idioms, Al-Hadithi has the uncanny ability 
to describe the Iraqi position in a way Westerners can understand. "You have to 
look at Iraq in 1968 to understand all this," Al-Hadithi said, explaining the 
invasion and Iraq's Orwellian overtones. "Until the (Baathist) revolution that 
year, there had been a serious contradiction in this country -- a rich country 
with a great potential for oil, a great potential for agriculture, a great 
potential for development. But, with all this, in 1968, if you tell somebody 
you are from Iraq, they think only of Iran. You say Iraq, he knows only 
something about the Arabian Nights. You say Baghdad, and he thinks only of 
feature films. 
</P>
<P>
"The country was in a lousy state. It was ruled by foreign embassies with spies 
everywhere. And the Iraqis had no place on the map. Saddam Hussein was able to 
shift Iraq from that state of backwardness to the state it is in now, where 
George Bush can say Iraq has the fourth-largest military in the world. Saddam 
Hussein aroused the pride in every Iraqi who was humiliated." 
</P>
<P>
Asked at one point during the crisis whether the Iraqis were concerned about 
the prospect of war, Al-Hadithi made a subtle but, he said, crucial distinction 
between the words worry and fear. 
</P>
<P>
"The most powerful man in the world doesn't want to be hurt or killed," he 
explained. "He has to be worried so that he prepares himself to defeat you. We 
have to be worried, of course. The only one who is not worried about war is the 
one who is not interested in life. But are we afraid of war? No. After eight 
years, we know what is war. Unlike the Americans, you see, sacrifice is a way 
of life in Iraq." 
</P>
<P>
That resilience in a nation already drained by war may explain why sanctions 
have not been as effective as the United States had hoped. Foreign trade has 
all but ceased, and Hussein's modern state has shown signs of crumbling, with 
power outages and shortages of industrial goods. However, most food staples 
have remained plentiful, thanks to rationing and supplies from Kuwait. And a 
popular uprising is unlikely, no matter how dire things get. 
</P>
<P>
Most Iraqis seem happy to blame Kuwait for their misery. In their view, the 
gravity wells the Kuwaitis used to pump oil out of the Rumaila field, which 
straddles the Iraqi border, were stealing millions of barrels of Iraq's only 
marketable resource. The Kuwaitis, Iraqis insisted, were deliberately glutting 
the world's oil market to keep gasoline prices down in the West. 
</P>
<P>
Furthermore, Iraqis considered Kuwait's emir and his ruling Al-Sabah family 
corrupt, arrogant spendthrifts who deserted their tiny, 27-year-old gulf state 
every summer to gamble in Monte Carlo or loll on the French Riviera. 
</P>
<P>
"Who cares about the Sabah family?" remarked a smiling, almost gleeful, Hicham 
Abdul Alim, a pharmacist approached at random in a Baghdad market. "These are 
people gone with the wind." 
</P>
<P>
FOR DECADES,a bronze statue of an anonymous Arab warrior on horseback stood in 
the Square of the Arab Knight, near the center of Baghdad. Soon after the 
invasion of Kuwait, however, government workmen removed the monument. A few 
days later, they erected a new, 3 1/2-story-high bronze likeness of Saddam 
Hussein, his right arm outstretched toward Saudi Arabia, Iraq's newest enemy 
and temporary home of the U. S. troops massed in the desert. 
</P>
<P>
There are thousands of Stalinesque statues and posters of Hussein in Baghdad, 
but none as large as the Arab Knight. And, in the days that followed the 
statue's installation, Hussein's party agents supposedly went throughout the 
city, looking for cafes, shops or hotels that bore the common Arabic name, "The 
Arab Knight." When they found one, they ordered the owner to remove his sign 
and change the name, adding simply, "There is now only one Arab Knight in 
Iraq." 
</P>
<P>
Near the square one evening, I approached an elderly date seller as he made his 
way home. He seemed fearful at first, but when asked his opinion of the new 
statuary, he relaxed a bit. 
</P>
<P>
"It's good, very good," he said with a largely toothless grin. "It shows the 
world how big we Iraqis are now." 
</P>
<P>
Reminded that the statue is not of just any Iraqi, but of their one and only 
ruler, the old man seemed offended. 
</P>
<P>
"He is our president, that is true," the date seller said, turning toward the 
statue. "But he is an Iraqi, too. And look how tall and how strong he is. This 
makes us very happy because Saddam's strength is our strength. And never before 
have we Iraqis been as strong as we are now. Look, even you Americans are 
afraid of us now." 
</P>
