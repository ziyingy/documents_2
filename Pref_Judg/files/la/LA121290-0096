A proposal to build a fence along the median of Interstate 5 to prevent more 
deaths of immigrants near the San Onofre checkpoint is "a waste of money," 
community leaders told Caltrans officials Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
A study by Cal State Fullerton researchers commissioned by Caltrans recently 
concluded that construction of a fence along 8 miles of the freeway just south 
of the Orange County line is the best way to prevent accidents that have 
claimed more than 100 lives in five years on highways between the Mexican 
border and San Clemente.

"I would say it's a waste of money," said Evelyn Colon Becktell, chairwoman of 
the Orange County Coalition for Immigrant Rights, who attended the Caltrans 
meeting at the Fullerton Public Library. "When they put up more lights (along 
the highway), the immigrants went farther up the highway, where there were no 
lights. The same thing is going to happen with the wall. They're going to go 
farther up along I-5, and one way or another, they're going to get killed."

Caltrans officials are hosting a series of meetings to expand public awareness 
about the immigrant deaths. They told the small gathering that they are working 
with officials of the Immigration and Naturalization Service, the U.S. Border 
Patrol and the California Highway Patrol to find a solution for a problem that 
stems from the tens of thousands of immigrants streaming in from Latin America 
every year.

Many of the deaths occur near the Border Patrol checkpoint near San Onofre. 
</P>
<P>
Immigrants making their way north by vehicle are often told by their "coyotes," 
or smugglers, to get out of the car and walk several miles north past the 
checkpoint to avoid detection by Border Patrol agents. The hike, often taken in 
the dark of night, involves crossing the north and southbound lanes of 
fast-moving traffic. 
</P>
<P>
"As the smuggling process becomes more sophisticated, we are seeing more 
problems at San Onofre," said Steve Saville of Caltrans' public affairs office. 
</P>
<P>
He and Jim Larson, another Caltrans spokesman, told those at the meeting that 
the wall is only a part of their campaign to prevent more deaths. They also are 
trying to spread the word among immigrants to be careful along the highways. 
</P>
<P>
One Caltrans flyer that has been handed out at hiring halls, community centers 
and churches says: "For the love of God do not cross the freeway." 
</P>
<P>
"It's difficult to say what's working, but the word is starting to get out," 
Larson said, noting that there has not been a death for several months near San 
Onofre. 
</P>
<P>
Researchers at Cal State Fullerton, nearing the end of a yearlong study, polled 
100 policy-makers, academics, immigrant advocates and others who have followed 
the issue. They found that 71% of all respondents stated that a barrier would 
be a "very effective" or "extremely effective" device to prevent the deaths. 
</P>
<P>
But those at the Orange County meeting told Caltrans officials that getting the 
word out about the dangers, rather than erecting a barrier, is a better 
solution. 
</P>
<P>
Caltrans's Larson said officials are still in the midst of hearing from more 
people before they make a final decision.
