<P>
When former California Assemblyman David Pierson set out seven years ago to 
finance construction of the world's largest card casino, he and two associates 
put up a total of $10,000 with hopes of someday turning a tidy profit. 
</P>
<P>
Instead, they became sudden multimillionaires. Since 1985, financial records 
show, the Bicycle Club in Bell Gardens has produced more than $50 million in 
profits for the three investors and their limited partners. 
</P>
<P>
The casino proceeds have helped Pierson, Beverly Hills bank executive M. Dale 
Lyon and business consultant Julieann Coyne Wasson acquire luxurious homes, 
fancy foreign cars and fat bank accounts. 
</P>
<P>
While attaining overnight wealth is not unheard of in some quarters of 
celebrity-studded Southern California, the Bicycle Club case is striking 
because the three investors now stand to lose their bonanza just as quickly as 
they got rich. 
</P>
<P>
When U.S. District Judge Norman C. Roettger Jr. ordered the seizure of the 
Bicycle Club in March -- making it the single largest asset ever forfeited to 
the federal government -- he also froze millions of dollars in monthly casino 
profits to LCP Associates, the partnership named for Lyon, Coyne and Pierson. 
Last week, Roettger released profits for a separate, minority group of partners 
led by the casino's general manager, George Hardie, but the profits of Lyon, 
Coyne and Pierson remain frozen. 
</P>
<P>
After growing accustomed to extraordinary wealth, the LCP investors now find 
themselves in the uncomfortable position of struggling financially to meet 
exorbitant monthly bills. 
</P>
<P>
To get their profits back, the three must prove in Roettger's Ft. Lauderdale 
courtroom that they are innocent investors who were unaware that an 
international drug money laundering operation funneled proceeds through the 
Bicycle Club. Federal prosecutors maintain that the government is entitled to 
LCP's 65% share of the Bicycle Club because the partnership arranged for the 
initial financing of $12 million in marijuana profits to build the casino. 
</P>
<P>
"The government's case is that these guys invested $10,000 and are now making 
$300,000 a month, so they must be crooks," said Richard Marmaro, a Century City 
lawyer who represents Lyon. 
</P>
<P>
Lyon, Coyne and Pierson each refused to be interviewed for this story. Through 
their attorneys and court documents, all three partners denied knowing that 
casino construction funds came from drug profits. 
</P>
<P>
Moreover, none of the three LCP investors have been charged with any 
wrongdoing, nor were they suspects in the recent drug money laundering trial 
that netted the convictions of one LCP partner and three Miami associates. 
</P>
<P>
A federal civil trial scheduled for the fall in U.S. District Court in Southern 
Florida is expected to determine if the investors had direct knowledge of the 
drug profits and whether they get to keep their shares of the Bicycle Club. 
</P>
<P>
During a forfeiture hearing last month, Lyon, 60, and Coyne, 40, were singled 
out by Assistant U.S. Atty. Robert Bondi as the partners who were "going to 
have a rather rough road to hoe" in trying to persuade the court that they have 
"clean hands." 
</P>
<P>
In addition, interviews and court documents reveal that Lyon and Pierson, 55, 
often had direct financial dealings with members of the narcotics money 
laundering network. 
</P>
<P>
Marmaro said flatly in an interview that federal prosecutors do not have a case 
against the LCP investors. 
</P>
<P>
The Bicycle Club's phenomenal success can be attributed to "a lot of hard work 
and risk" taken by the partners, Marmaro said. He likened Lyon to Alexander 
Graham Bell, Henry Ford and John D. Rockefeller -- entrepreneurs who relied on 
an idea, not a large investment, to launch profitable ventures. 
</P>
<P>
"No one believed that the Bicycle Club would be as enormously successful as it 
has been," Marmaro said. 
</P>
<P>
The casino, valued at $150 million, yielded $23.4 million in net profits last 
year, and is the source of nearly half of the $21-million annual budget of the 
city of Bell Gardens. Nearly 2,000 people work there, operating 168 gaming 
tables around the clock. 
</P>
<P>
As the principal organizer of LCP, Pierson has received the largest share of 
the net profits -- $14.5 million since 1985. 
</P>
<P>
It was through the legendary developer and UCLA basketball booster Sam Gilbert 
that Pierson and his partners acquired their fortunes. Prosecutors said Gilbert 
funneled millions in marijuana profits through Southern California banks and 
businesses as part of a scheme to launder drug funds and finance the Bicycle 
Club. Gilbert died at age 74 of heart failure three days before he was indicted 
in November, 1987. 
</P>
<P>
Ironically, a large part of the LCP partners' case to the government will focus 
on denouncing Gilbert -- the very man responsible for their stunning financial 
success -- and denying any involvement in his dealings with drug proceeds. 
</P>
<P>
Pierson, for example, claims that he "had no reason to suspect that a man of 
Sam Gilbert's reputation, background and resources would be involved in illegal 
money laundering," his Florida attorney, Robert L. Shevin, wrote in court 
papers. 
</P>
<P>
Marmaro added in an interview: "They were dealing with a man, Sam Gilbert, who 
had an impeccable reputation, or so everybody thought. They weren't dealing 
with Al Capone. . . . No one knew at that time what we know now about Sam 
Gilbert." 
</P>
<P>
The LCP profits paid to Gilbert's three adult children and his grandchildren -- 
who thus far have received approximately $10 million -- also have been seized 
by the government pending the outcome of the forfeiture case. His eldest son, 
Michael, faces a possible 35 years in prison pending his sentencing on four 
guilty verdicts in the money- 
</P>
<P>
laundering trial. 
</P>
<P>
Last week, Roettger signed an order releasing a portion of the Bicycle Club's 
monthly profits to 25 investors who own the 35% of the casino not held by LCP. 
The group is led by Hardie, the club's colorful general manager, who has 
cooperated with federal authorities from the beginning. 
</P>
<P>
Neither Hardie nor his partners "have any illegal interest in the Bicycle Club 
which should be forfeited to the United States," according to a letter written 
last November by the U.S. attorney's office in Southern Florida. 
</P>
<P>
No such statement from federal authorities has cleared Lyon, Coyne or Pierson. 
</P>
<P>
The Bicycle Club was born from a dream that Pierson held since the 1970s. 
Having spent two decades as a lawyer, an Inglewood city councilman and a state 
legislator representing South-Central Los Angeles, he sought to obtain a card 
club license -- first in Inglewood. 
</P>
<P>
But city officials there rejected all bids, including Pierson's, and it wasn't 
until 1983 that he spotted an opportunity to finance a card casino in Bell 
Gardens. 
</P>
<P>
What follows is a chronology -- based on dozens of interviews, thousands of 
pages of court documents and extensive witness testimony given during the 
money-laundering trial -- of how the Bicycle Club was financed by the LCP 
investors with the help of Sam Gilbert and his Miami drug associates. 
</P>
<P>
It was Hardie, later to become general manager of the Bicycle Club, who first 
acquired the rights to 20 acres in Bell Gardens and a city license to operate a 
club there in 1982. Within a year, however, Hardie was having difficulty 
raising the millions of dollars he needed in construction funds. 
</P>
<P>
Hardie had met Pierson several years earlier when Hardie was promoting a 
statewide dog racing initiative. In the spring of 1983, Pierson suggested a 
plan: Hardie would contribute his club license and the site while Pierson would 
raise $12 million in financing. Pierson and his associates would get a 65% 
ownership interest in the Bicycle Club, with the remaining 35% for Hardie and 
his partners. 
</P>
<P>
All Pierson had to do was come up with the $12 million. For this, he turned to 
Sam Gilbert, a man he knew to be of significant wealth. Gilbert, after all, had 
made personal loans to Pierson totaling $850,000. 
</P>
<P>
Pierson was first introduced to Gilbert by Julieann Coyne in 1981. That same 
year, he recruited Gilbert as a founding director of Olympic National Bank, 
which Pierson organized and is headquartered in Gilbert's Trident Center in 
West Los Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
In mid-1983, Pierson brought a Bicycle Club prospectus to Coyne and asked her 
to present it to Gilbert. Coyne and Gilbert were "very close personal friends," 
Pierson testified during the criminal trial. 
</P>
<P>
Gilbert, after reviewing the Bicycle Club plans, agreed to supply $12 million 
in financing from an offshore trust account in return for 60% of Pierson's 
nearly two-thirds share of the Bicycle Club. 
</P>
<P>
But before the agreement was finalized, Gilbert had a sudden change of heart. 
He decided to give equal shares of his interest in the casino to Coyne and her 
former boss at Imperial Bank, Dale Lyon. Coyne had introduced Gilbert to Lyon. 
</P>
<P>
Under Gilbert's plan, he would furnish the $12 million to the Bicycle Club. In 
return, his construction firm would receive a $2-million fee to build the 
casino. 
</P>
<P>
Pierson went along with Gilbert's wishes and organized LCP Associates, which 
became the principal owner of the Bicycle Club. The partnership was formed in 
November, 1983, with an initial investment of $10,000 -- Pierson paid $4,000 to 
cover his 40% interest in LCP and Lyon and Coyne put in $3,000 apiece for their 
30% shares. The money went toward the cost of establishing the partnership. 
</P>
<P>
At the same time, Lyon was appointed president of CGL Investments Inc., a 
partnership Gilbert formed along with Coyne to receive the $12 million in 
laundered money, prosecutors alleged in court. They called CGL "nothing more 
than a repository for drug money." 
</P>
<P>
In late 1983, Lyon met with Miami lawyer Melvyn Kessler at the L'Ermitage Hotel 
in Beverly Hills to discuss the offshore accounts that would finance the 
Bicycle Club. Kessler was later convicted in the money laundering trial on 
conspiracy and racketeering charges. Lyon also would travel with Gilbert to 
Washington, New York and Florida to confer with Kessler and two other Miami 
drug associates, Jack and Barry Benjamin Kramer. The Kramers were found guilty 
of the same charges as Kessler; in addition, Ben Kramer is serving a life 
sentence in a related drug smuggling case. 
</P>
<P>
Within a year and a half of Gilbert forming the partnerships to fund the 
Bicycle Club, Coyne mysteriously dropped out of any further involvement in the 
casino. She gave up her work as a personnel consultant at the casino before she 
could contribute to the club's astounding success, reduced her role in LCP to 
limited partner status in 1984, and resigned from CGL Investments in 1985. 
</P>
<P>
Just as Gilbert had arranged for her to own a lucrative share of the Bicycle 
Club, he had insisted that Coyne be given responsibility for screening and 
hiring casino employees, Hardie testified. 
</P>
<P>
One of Coyne's first decisions involved the hiring of her longtime manicurist 
as a $30,000-a-year personnel director, said sources familiar with the casino's 
start-up operation. With Coyne out of the picture several months later, the 
manicurist was dismissed, the sources said. 
</P>
<P>
Although Coyne had virtually nothing to do with the Bicycle Club by 1985, she 
has collected $9.7 million in casino profits through last year. 
</P>
<P>
Her departure left Lyon, Pierson and Gilbert to oversee the club's financing 
arrangements. 
</P>
<P>
Lyon played a key role as the bookkeeper who handled the paper work and 
financial transactions from 1984 to 1987 among the Bicycle Club, LCP, the 
investment firm CGL and the offshore accounts. He would follow Gilbert's 
directions in dispersing and depositing millions of dollars in checks, Marmarow 
said. He was the casino's first chief financial officer and has received $13.8 
million in club profits. 
</P>
<P>
Beginning in 1984, the Bicycle Club received $12 million in Miami drug money 
that initially was laundered in Los Angeles by Gilbert before being sent to 
foreign accounts in the tiny European country of Liechtenstein and the Virgin 
Islands, according to federal authorities. From there, financial documents 
show, the funds were wired to CGL Investments and passed on to the Bicycle 
Club. The casino broke ground on April Fool's Day in 1984. 
</P>
<P>
When the casino's construction costs incurred by Gilbert's firm soared to $22 
million in 1984, Lyon and Pierson secured an additional $10 million in loans 
from banks and business associates. 
</P>
<P>
Thus, the Bicycle Club opened on time in November, 1984. Within three months, 
it began making a profit and grew wildly successful later that year after it 
was permitted to introduce popular Asian card games. 
</P>
<P>
After the club was built, Lyon loaned $1.6 million in money received from the 
offshore accounts to Jack Kramer, the Miami associate who was recently 
convicted. Lyon testified that he issued the loan at the request of Gilbert, 
but Kramer failed to repay the money. The loan was one of several advances of 
laundered funds that Lyon made to Kramer at the direction of Gilbert, Lyon said 
in court. 
</P>
<P>
In what Lyon's lawyer described as "the most curious transaction" in the 
Bicycle Club case, Pierson gave $500,000 in LCP profits to Jack Kramer without 
notifying Lyon or Coyne. The money, which Pierson intended as a loan, was never 
repaid, Pierson acknowledged in court testimony. 
</P>
<P>
Pierson said he made the loan in April, 1986, when Gilbert asked him to help 
one of his longtime family and business friends. "I was delighted to be able to 
do a favor for Sam Gilbert," he testified. 
</P>
<P>
Two months later, at Gilbert's request, Pierson loaned an additional $200,000 
in Bicycle Club profits to Kramer. 
</P>
<P>
By then, federal authorities were on the trail of the money laundering 
operation after receiving a tip from Scotland Yard about the suspicious nature 
of the offshore accounts. 
</P>
<P>
Lyon and Pierson first learned of the criminal investigation in November, 1986, 
when they were contacted by federal agents for an interview. Several months 
later, the Miami drug associates demanded the return of the $12 million in 
Bicycle Club funds to yet another foreign account in Switzerland, prosecutors 
said. 
</P>
<P>
By this time, Gilbert had become fed up with the financial complications and 
withdrew from any further involvement in the casino. 
</P>
<P>
Although the Miami associates had no right under the loan agreement to demand a 
sudden repayment of the loan, Lyon and Pierson helped refinance the Bicycle 
Club, which by then was generating substantial profits. Both partners said in 
court that they did so to save $700,000 a month in interest payments. They 
denied participating in any effort to conceal the funds from authorities. 
</P>
<P>
In November, 1987, a federal grand jury returned indictments against Gilbert 
and his Miami colleagues. The case attracted little attention in Southern 
Florida, where drug trials are commonplace and create scant publicity. 
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Bicycle Club profits continued to soar. In the past two years alone, 
the LCP partners have received more than $30 million in profits from the club. 
</P>
<P>
In an effort to preserve their future monthly casino dividends, the LCP 
investors recently filed court affidavits pleading for the reinstatement of 
their profits. 
</P>
<P>
Pierson appears to be in the best position to retain his interest in the 
Bicycle Club, according to Shevin, Pierson's Miami lawyer. This is because 
unlike Lyon or Coyne, Pierson had no role in the CGL investment firm that 
interacted with the Miami drug associates, Shevin said. Pierson also agreed to 
testify at the criminal trial without demanding immunity from prosecution. 
</P>
<P>
Coyne refused to appear at the criminal trial, citing her constitutional 5th 
Amendment privilege against self-incrimination. And Lyon testified only under 
the condition that he receive immunity from prosecution. 
</P>
<P>
As the forfeiture trial nears, even those with the slightest connection to the 
casino have hired lawyers to scramble for a slice of the jackpot. These include 
Lyon's children, Coyne's husband, Pierson's ex-wife, Gilbert's two sons, his 
disabled daughter and grandchildren and even the former spouse of Ben Kramer, 
the convicted narcotics smuggler. The relatives and children of the LCP 
partners were given the ownership shares and had no involvement in financing 
the casino. 
</P>
<P>
Recently, Roettger noted the high stakes involved in the case as he peered 
across a courtroom packed with attorneys charging as much as $100,000 a month 
in legal fees. 
</P>
<P>
"I have never had so many lawyers in one case whose meters have been running so 
long," he said. "Clearly this is a matter of considerable interest, especially 
in the Los Angeles area, or I would not have so many distinguished lawyers here 
looking out for (their clients') interests."
