San Diego police recaptured the fifth of 13 South Bay County Jail escapees late 
Saturday afternoon within walking distance of the main police headquarters at 
14th Street and Broadway.

Lance Williams, 25, who was in jail on suspicion of assault with a deadly 
weapon before his escape Wednesday, was found inside a camper parked in a lot 
at 15th and F streets, a police spokesman said.

After police received a call reporting that Williams had been seen in the 
parking lot, Officers Ken Brown and Jorge Estrada made the short trip to the 
site and arrested Williams without incident, the spokesman said.

The escapee was found inside a brown and white camper with two other persons. 
One of the other men was arrested on an outstanding felony warrant, police 
said.

Williams was returned to County Jail.

The 13 escapees lowered themselves on bedsheets from a fourth-floor window in 
the South Bay jail's high security unit Wednesday night after they apparently 
cut through the steel bars in the windows with hacksaws smuggled in through 
windows in one of the jail's day rooms.

The jail break, the largest in the county in modern history, brought calls for 
increased security measures from the Board of Supervisors' Chairman Leon 
Williams. He has placed a proposal for a review of security at all county jail 
facilities on the Tuesday agenda of the county board.
