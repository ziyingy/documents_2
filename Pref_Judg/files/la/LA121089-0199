Several hundred people gathered Saturday to commemorate two sea battles that 
underlined the importance of the Falkland Islands as a major South Atlantic 
base for the Royal Navy in two world wars.

The veterans and survivors marched past the Cenotaph memorial to Britain's war 
dead to mark the 75th anniversary of the Battle of the Falkland Islands in 
World War I and the 50th anniversary of the Battle of the River Plate in World 
War II.
