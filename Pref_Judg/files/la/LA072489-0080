Richard Chamberlain's new series for CBS has been given both a new title and a 
new look, according to Chamberlain and his co-executive producers, Nigel and 
Carol McKeand.

The new fall medical series, which had been announced in the spring under the 
working title "The Hawaiian," is now called "Island Son," and is one of several 
fall series -- including NBC's "Nutt House" and ABC's "Living Dolls" -- which 
are being re-tooled or undergoing some casting changes before making their 
debut in September.

In this case, at the request of the network, "Island Son," about a heroic 
doctor (Chamberlain) practicing in Hawaii, will tone down its original bent 
toward the ancient Hawaiian traditions of holistic medicine in favor of more 
conservative medical techniques.

Chamberlain and the show's two other executive producers, Nigel and Carol 
McKeand, told journalists gathered at the Century Plaza for the TV industry's 
annual summer press tour that "Island Son" would stress less of the "mystical 
side of healing" than it did in the first scenes produced and shown to the 
network.

"We're taking it easy on that stuff for the general public," Chamberlain said.

Chamberlain and the McKeands were responding to questions prompted by reports 
that CBS was dissatisfied with the original concept of the show, which was sold 
to the network with only a description of the concept and without a pilot. 
Nigel McKeand said that he and the network had come to an agreement months ago 
that the American public might be less receptive to ancient Hawaiian medical 
practices than to the antiseptic hospital techniques Chamberlain used 20 years 
ago when he portrayed Dr. Kildare. "I agreed with them, I agreed that we should 
cool it in that area," he said.

McKeand also said that the producers were still looking for an actress to 
portray Dr. Caitlin McKenna. They said they would make their decision this 
week; shooting on the series starts filming today in Hawaii.

Chamberlain said that one of the original scenes the network found questionable 
was one in which a Hawaiian healer transferred some of the pain of childbirth 
from a woman in labor to her husband when the pain became too severe for her to 
take. Chamberlain called the practice "not uncommon" among such healers.

"It was a good scene," Chamberlain said. "But I think we lost our way a little 
bit there. I don't think you can expect an audience to accept that as easily as 
we did."
