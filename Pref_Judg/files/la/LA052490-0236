The other recipients to be honored at the luncheon today are:

* Morris Goodson, Leon Robertson, Leon Hudspeth, Thomas Dean and Thermon 
Holliday, who were participating in a Bible study group last October when an 
intruder put a broken bottle to a woman's neck and demanded that church members 
hand over their money. When the assailant tried to get away, the five men 
subdued him.

"One hit him with a chair, another tackled him, the rest held him down," said 
Community Relations Officer Tom Delgado. 
</P>

* Robert Jones Jr., who pulled an unconscious woman from the bottom of a 
swimming pool in June and administered artificial respiration until paramedics 
arrived. His action saved the woman's life.

<P>
* Nazo Manoukian and Traci Auzenne, who spotted a man stealing a car, followed 
him and notified police of the crime via a cellular telephone. During the 
chase, the robber pulled out a handgun and fired twice at Manoukian and 
Auzenne.

* Another cellular-phone tipster, Paul Jacobs, who called police and then

February. The robbers, seeing Jacobs following them, tried to ram his car.
