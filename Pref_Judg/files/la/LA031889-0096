Many investors think investing in municipal bonds is safe. But thousands of 
investors nationwide are learning otherwise, falling prey to unscrupulous 
brokerage houses and sales people touting "safe" municipal bonds that in fact 
carry high default risks. 
</P>
<P>
Unfortunately, the elderly or retirees -- those who can least afford losses 
from bond defaults -- are among the prime victims. But there are some simple 
and straightforward steps you can take to avoid being taken. 
</P>
<P>
Aggressive salespeople -- often working out of small brokerage firms or 
so-called boiler room telemarketing operations -- are taking advantage of the 
growing popularity of municipal bonds, which generally pay interest that is 
exempt from federal tax and often state tax as well. Tax reform made munis one 
of the few remaining tax shelters, and thus individual investors are flocking 
to them. 
</P>
<P>
Individuals today account for about three-fourths of the $720 billion invested 
in municipal bonds. That is a far higher percentage than earlier this decade, 
when banks and other big institutions were the major buyers of munis. 
</P>
<P>
"Because of the tax benefits, you'll see people who would never think of 
putting some money into stocks and bonds putting very substantial amounts into 
municipal bonds," says Scott Stapf, director of investor education for the 
North American Securities Administrators Assn., a group of state securities 
regulators. 
</P>
<P>
The overwhelming majority of munis are considered sound investments and are 
bought by mutual funds, big institutions and sophisticated individual 
investors. 
</P>
<P>
But in recent years, the municipal bond market has become increasingly complex 
-- and risky. It used to be that munis were issued almost entirely in the form 
of "general obligation" bonds backed by state and local tax revenues. They were 
used to finance roads, bridges, sewers and other public infrastructure 
projects. 
</P>
<P>
Now, however, many munis carry names of municipalities but in fact are not 
backed by those government entities at all. Instead, they are issued by private 
developers, corporations or other private parties to finance projects ranging 
from sports arenas to nursing homes to manufacturing facilities. Revenues to 
pay interest and principal on the bonds comes directly or indirectly from the 
project involved, rather than from the tax base of the municipality. 
</P>
<P>
Many of these so-called conduit bonds issued prior to 1986 nonetheless enjoyed 
tax-free status because municipalities -- hungry for added jobs and tax 
revenues -- lent their tax-exempt status to these projects. Tax reform in 1986 
restricted the ability of municipalities to grant tax-free status, but many 
private entities have gone ahead and issued munis anyway -- except now they may 
be taxable instead of tax-free. 
</P>
<P>
Whether taxable or tax-free, these bonds must offer higher yields to compensate 
for their higher risks. But because of their risks, "big, reputable brokerage 
firms and sophisticated investors won't touch this stuff," says C. Richard 
Lehmann, president of the Bond Investors Assn., a nationwide group based in 
Miami that tracks bond defaults. That leaves them to be marketed primarily to 
small investors. 
</P>
<P>
Unfortunately, some salespeople and brokerages specializing in underwriting and 
selling these bonds -- and earning enormous fees and commissions -- fail to 
adequately disclose the risks involved. Some marketers have even been claiming 
that these bonds are as safe as Treasury bills or bank certificates of deposit 
-- when in fact investors can lose on average as much as 50 cents on the dollar 
if these bonds default. 
</P>
<P>
For example, a small Jackson, Miss., brokerage firm, Buchanan &amp; Co., 
recently shut down amid investigations by regulators from at least four states. 
Investigators found that of 137 bond issues that the firm had underwritten or 
sold since 1982, at least 64 have defaulted. More than $400 million of bonds 
were involved in the failures. But investors -- mostly elderly and retired -- 
were told these bonds were "99% safe" and "second only to government bonds in 
security," investigators say. 
</P>
<P>
Californians have not been major victims of these scams yet, but they 
nonetheless should be aware of the potential for problems, says G. William 
McDonald, enforcement chief for the state Department of Corporations, which 
regulates securities brokerages. 
</P>
<P>
Overall default rates on municipals have been rising nationwide, with some 140 
issues with a value of $1.24 billion defaulting in 1987 and a similar number 
expected for 1988 when all totals are in, says Lehmann of the Bond Investors 
Assn. The 1987 figure exceeded the total number of bond failures for the entire 
period between 1972 and 1983, the bond group says. Most of the defaults have 
been among the conduit bonds issued by private entities. 
</P>
<P>
Compounding the problem is the fact that municipal bonds are far less regulated 
than stocks or corporate bonds. Little disclosure is required of issuers; for 
many issues there is no prospectus or statement of any kind laying out 
pertinent information. Issuers also are not required to file quarterly or 
annual reports detailing the status of their projects. 
</P>
<P>
"You could be buying a defaulted bond and not even know it," Lehmann says. 
</P>
<P>
Munis "remain perhaps the single least regulated and most ill-understood 
investment instrument that is likely to end up in the portfolio of a typical 
investor," say the North American Securities Administrators Assn. and the 
Better Business Bureau in a recent statement. 
</P>
<P>
"It's very easy even for an investor with some sophistication to make a 
mistake" investing in munis, says Stapf of the state securities group. He cites 
the example of the thousands of institutions and individuals who lost money in 
the record $2.25-billion default of the Washington Public Power Supply System 
(better known at Whoops). 
</P>
<P>
The problem of inadequate disclosure has caught the eye of the Securities and 
Exchange Commission. Last year, it proposed new rules that would increase 
disclosure on municipal bond issues exceeding $10 million in total value. 
</P>
<P>
Unfortunately, however, the riskiest bonds today are issued in blocks that fall 
below the $10-million threshold. While bond issues exceeding $10 million 
accounted for 86% of the dollar volume of all bonds issued last year, they 
accounted for only 1,743 of the 6,972 individual bond financings. It is 
precisely these smaller issues that are most likely to be promoted to small 
investors, Stapf says. 
</P>
<P>
The problem of risky bonds being sold to investors without adequate disclosure 
also extends into popular unit investment trusts, Stapf says. Unit investment 
trusts, like mutual funds, allow investors to buy a piece of a portfolio of 
bonds, earning a share of the interest payments. 
</P>
<P>
The majority of these trusts are sound investments and are marketed by 
reputable firms. But some unscrupulous marketers -- earning generous 
commissions and fees -- have been placing high-risk munis into these portfolios 
in order to boost yields and make them more attractive to investors. 
</P>
<P>
"But they go without telling investors that they are getting riskier and 
riskier bonds," Stapf says. 
</P>
<P>
Further, some of these marketers of unit trusts also underwrote the bonds -- a 
potential conflict of interest. 
</P>
<P>
Stapf adds that unit trusts historically are promoted to elderly and retirees. 
"That magnifies the concern about the potential for damage. The investors are 
not your typical yuppies." 
</P>
<P>
How can you avoid being taken in shaky muni bond investments? Here are some 
suggestions: 
</P>
<P>
* Be wary of any investments pitched over the phone by strangers. Thanks to 
lenient regulations, Little Rock, Ark., has become a haven for many boiler room 
operations pitching high-risk munis. But they hawk their wares nationwide. 
</P>
<P>
* Get all performance-related claims in writing from a broker. Act only on 
those promises that a broker is willing to commit to paper. 
</P>
<P>
* Learn about the basics of a municipal bond before investing. Where will the 
revenues come from to service the bonds? Where will the proceeds go, and what 
portion will go to lawyers, financial consultants and developers in hefty fees? 
What is the financial condition of the issuer, and what are the economic 
prospects for its project? 
</P>
<P>
Also important to ask: Who is going to make a market in the bond if I need to 
sell it? Some smaller bond issues are so thinly traded that it may be hard to 
resell them at a price close to their face or market value. 
</P>
<P>
* If you can't tolerate losses, consider investing in bonds with insurance to 
protect against losses through default. Lehmann of the bond investors group 
says bond insurance will generally cost you about a half a percentage point of 
yield. "But for most people it's worth it," he says. 
</P>
<P>
* Consider investing in municipal bonds through reputable mutual fund 
companies. Many also offer high-yield municipal bond funds, but you can rely on 
the professional expertise of the portfolio manager to sort out the junk from 
the quality.
