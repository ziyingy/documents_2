A Greenpeace ship and a Japanese whaling vessel collided Tuesday off Antarctica 
in the most serious incident since the environmental group began a campaign a 
week ago to stop the whale hunt. 
</P>

The Japanese ship Nisshin Maru No. 3 sustained minor damage to its handrails, 
but the Greenpeace ship Gondwana was not damaged, Greenpeace spokesman Peter 
Wilkinson said. There were no injuries, he said, speaking by radio telephone 
from the Gondwana.

In Sydney, the Greenpeace coordinator for Antarctica, Lyn Goldsworthy, said the 
Japanese ship had attached a grappling hook to the 1,435-ton Gondwana, which 
has a crew of 19, to pull it out of the way, and that "in the maneuvering that 
resulted, the Japanese boat collided with the Gondwana."

In Tokyo, a whaling official said Tuesday that attempts by the environmental 
group to block the whale hunt are endangering the lives of crewmen.

"This is terrorism, the same as that opposed by the United States and other 
countries," said Takehiro Takayama of the Tokyo-based Japan Whaling Assn. "They 
have no concern about human life."

Japan has said it plans to take 300 whales this year as part of its scientific 
research to determine the size of whale stocks. 
</P>
<P>
Greenpeace contends that the research is an attempt to circumvent a moratorium 
on commercial whaling imposed by the International Whaling Commission and that 
most of the whale meat will end up in sushi restaurants in Japan.

Wilkinson estimated that Japanese harpooners have already taken between 50 and 
55 Minke whales this season, about 10 of them since the Gondwana caught up with 
the whaling fleet a week ago.
