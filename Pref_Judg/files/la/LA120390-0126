Trouble with the $150-million Astro observatory today delayed Columbia 
astronauts' scientific research, and as the hours ticked by scientists on the 
ground said some planned observations would not be made.

"There's a definite loss as we go," said mission scientist Ted Gull. "Some 
objects are just going to slip off the list."

Despite hours of efforts that stretched into early afternoon, NASA officials 
had trouble calibrating the observatory's instrument pointing system, which 
affects all three ultraviolet telescopes. A problem involving a computer that 
controls the movements of one telescope, however, was solved.

Mission manager Jack Jones said another star tracker on board, attached to one 
of the telescopes, will be used to point the telescopes if the main pointing 
system continues to malfunction. The instrument is more awkward to operate, 
however, since it is designed for another purpose.

"Whichever one of these we demonstrate can work first, our plan is to 
immediately go into that mode of operation and start gathering science," he 
said.

The Astro had been expected to look at about 250 high-energy objects, including 
stars, quasars, galaxies, Jupiter, a supernova and Comet Levy.

<P>
The ultraviolet light and X-rays emitted from these objects cannot be seen by 
ground-based instruments because they are unable to penetrate the Earth's 
atmosphere. 
</P>
<P>
Because at least half a day of work has now been lost, that number will be 
trimmed, officials said.

"Sure we're disappointed, but we knew this was a crucial step and might go 
slower than we planned," said Arthur Code, a University of Wisconsin scientist 
who helped design one of the telescopes.

Columbia blasted into orbit early Sunday on a mission that was originally 
scheduled to fly in 1986 but was postponed by the Challenger explosion. 
Hydrogen leaks forced three launch delays earlier this year, and a telescope 
problem halted a fourth countdown.
