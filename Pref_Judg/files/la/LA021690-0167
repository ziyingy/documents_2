Changing water temperatures in the tropical Pacific Ocean may be signaling the 
start of a new El Nino, a climate event that could be felt worldwide, 
government scientists said today. 
</P>
<P>
"The current situation deserves very close attention," the federal Climate 
Analysis Center said in a statement. 
</P>
<P>
The latest El Nino in 1986 was relatively mild, but one in 1982-83 led to 
weather changes that were blamed for 1,500 deaths and billions of dollars in 
damage across the globe. 
</P>
<P>
"We don't want to say something is developing that could be like that, because 
that was exceptional," Vernon Kousky of the climate center said. 
</P>
<P>
The 1982-83 El Nino was blamed for worsening the devastating drought in Africa 
and causing a series of severe winter storms to come ashore in California. 
</P>
<P>
Kousky's office constantly monitors sea surface conditions, and has learned the 
warning signs that an El Nino may be developing.
