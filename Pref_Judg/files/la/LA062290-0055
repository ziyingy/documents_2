A Ventura County prosecutor said Thursday that he wants to prevent Diane Mannes 
from being tried on murder charges by the same judge who dismissed identical 
charges against her last year. 
</P>
<P>
Deputy Dist. Atty. Donald C. Glynn filed a motion to have Judge Robert Soares 
replaced by another judge before Mannes goes to trial on July 30. Glynn said 
Soares should excuse himself because "he has expressed an opinion about the 
case that showed prejudice." 
</P>
<P>
Mannes, 35, of Somis, pleaded not guilty Thursday to three counts of murder in 
the drunk driving deaths of three young men who were walking on the shoulder of 
the Ventura Freeway on the Conejo Grade last year. 
</P>
<P>
On March 31, 1989, Mannes' Ford Bronco slammed into Jacob Boyd, 14, and Joshua 
Oxenreider, 19, both of Camarillo, and Scott Mullins, 20, of Mansfield, Ohio, 
killing them and injuring two of their friends. Tests showed that her blood 
contained twice the 0.10% legal definition of drunkenness. 
</P>

On Nov. 17, a Superior Court jury convicted Mannes of two felony drunk driving 
charges but deadlocked on three second-degree murder charges. Glynn moved to 
retry Mannes on the murder charges, but Soares refused to reset the case for 
trial and dismissed the charges. His ruling cited a lack of evidence that 
Mannes acted with malice or was aware of her actions. 
</P>
<P>
The ruling said a second trial would be "a waste of time and money" and 
concluded, "There is no likelihood that a retrial on these charges will result 
in a unanimous verdict of murder." 
</P>
<P>
Glynn refiled murder charges in Municipal Court, where a judge refused Deputy 
Public Defender Robert Dahlstedt's motion to have them dismissed. Dahlstedt 
appealed that judge's ruling on grounds of double jeopardy -- an appeal that 
was rejected in Superior Court, 2nd District Court of Appeal and state Supreme 
Court. 
</P>
<P>
On Thursday, Dahlstedt complicated the latest round of courtroom maneuverings 
by filing a highly unusual plea of illegal double jeopardy on Mannes' behalf. 
Dahlstedt argued that Mannes should not be tried a second time after a jury had 
failed to convict her the first time. 
</P>
<P>
Dahlstedt asked Soares to schedule two separate trials: one for the plea of 
illegal double jeopardy and one for the criminal charges. The public defender 
said that if a jury finds that a second criminal trial would place Mannes in 
double jeopardy, then no murder trial can be held. 
</P>
<P>
Soares scheduled both trials for July 30, when he -- or the judge who replaces 
him -- will decide whether one or two juries should hear the matters. 
</P>
<P>
Dahlstedt also filed a motion Thursday to suspend Proposition 115 for Mannes' 
criminal trial and allow attorneys, not the judge, to choose the juries. 
Proposition 115 was passed on June 5, giving judges the responsibility of 
choosing juries. 
</P>
<P>
"In a case like this, there's lots of publicity and it's a very emotional 
case," Dahlstedt said after the arraignment. "I don't think judges who aren't 
practiced in picking juries would be able to question jurors and draw out any 
biases they might have." 
</P>
<P>
A hearing will be held June 27 on that motion and on Glynn's motion to have 
Soares replaced. 
</P>
<P>
After arraignment, Mannes was returned to Ventura County Jail, where she is 
serving four years for the felony drunk-driving charges.
