"Balconies" reads one of the signs in Ron Knoll's storage area. "Solar Panels," 
says another, "Pines -- Black Forest" a third. 
</P>
<P>
The signs are just the sort of thing one might expect in a designer's 
warehouse, with one difference. They're glued to the front of small plastic 
boxes. 
</P>
<P>
Inside the boxes are bunches of balconies and window frames, piles of solar 
panels and pines. All are no taller than three inches. 
</P>
<P>
These are the components of architectural models, small-scale constructions 
that render the flat blue lines of an architect's drawings into office 
buildings and shopping malls long before any ground is bulldozed or walls are 
built. 
</P>
<P>
A model maker "has to have the ability to see three-dimensionally. He breaks 
the drawings down into simple blocks and then builds it up again," said Knoll, 
founder of Knoll Architectural Models in Rockville, Md. 
</P>
<P>
As recently as 10 years ago architectural model makers used paper and wood, the 
traditional materials of ship models. Most models were straightforward 
interpretations of the blueprints, with painted-on lawns and mirrors glued to 
the base for lakes. 
</P>
<P>
But as the development of commercial complexes around the country has 
mushroomed, and the marketing of them has become increasingly competitive, 
architectural models have grown larger, showier and substantially more 
expensive. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Some Use Remote Control 
</P>
<P>
They are fast becoming the vehicle through which office tenants are recruited, 
community zoning and planning bodies persuaded, and the project's overall 
ambience expressed. 
</P>
<P>
Some elaborate building models, costing several hundred thousand dollars, have 
moving parts that can be operated by remote control, much like changing 
television channels. 
</P>
<P>
Walls are moved to see inside a building, lights are dimmed to reflect a 
building's profile at nightfall and roofs are lifted to view an interior floor 
plan. 
</P>
<P>
As the real estate market began to tighten in the early 1980s, developers began 
to seek new ways to grab the attention of lenders and tenants. At the same 
time, movie producers such as Steven Spielberg and George Lucas began to expand 
the use of models with scenes such as the intergalactic battles in "Star Wars." 
</P>
<P>
The advent of computer-aided design, however, turned the model-making industry 
inside out. Computers can be used in photographic chemical milling, a process 
that uses an acid bath to cut tiny fences, doors, girders and the like out of 
brass or plastic. 
</P>
<P>
Such materials are much stronger than the traditional materials and allow 
greater complexity and crispness in model construction, Knoll said. 
</P>
<P>
In addition, computers have given model makers the ability to go beyond mere 
technical accuracy to a level of factual design. 
</P>
<P>
In the construction of an office complex, for example, the model maker can 
fashion such detail that a viewer can see window dressings in the storefronts 
and patterns in the inlay of lobby ceilings. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Complex Model Built 
</P>
<P>
"Models used to be pretty objects, but with computers, they have become 
interactive displays," said Trip Anderson, founder of Trip Tech Models Inc. in 
Waltham, Mass. "Model makers are not merely technicians anymore -- they're 
artisans. They're bringing ideas to life." 
</P>
<P>
Anderson's firm has just completed a 10-foot-by-12-foot model of Reston, 
Va.-based Himmel-MKDG's proposed Reston Town Center that includes more than 70 
electrical circuits and 100 separately designed miniature storefronts. 
</P>
<P>
Tiny human figures in realistic poses crowd the model's streets. A man clutches 
his hat against the wind on one corner, while a group of office workers eat 
sandwiches in a park area near another. The miniature marquee on the model's 
movie theater advertises "Hairnet" and "Desk Jobs." 
</P>
<P>
While traditional models were meant to last only long enough to convey the 
architect's ideas to the developer, the newer models are meant to have a life 
of two or three years -- long enough for the developer to convey his ideas to 
prospective lenders and tenants. 
</P>
<P>
The new models also cost a lot more. Traditional models carry a price tag of 
between $5,000 and $20,000. Elaborate models with interactive lighting and 
other realistic details start at $250,000. Anderson's model of the Reston Town 
Center cost $500,000. 
</P>
<P>
For that, model makers say, a developer gets a creation that will not only show 
a planning commission how the buildings will sit on the land, but tenants and 
potential investment partners just what sort of atmosphere they'll be getting 
for their money. 
</P>
<P>
"What we do is put together a sense of reality for a project before it exists," 
said David Gibson, the Dallas model maker credited with introducing theatrical 
lighting devices and intricately detailed interiors into the industry 
repertoire. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Have Become Standard 
</P>
<P>
Gibson made the first of the "super-models" in 1974, when he fashioned an 
8-foot-high rendition of the lobby proposed for the Pennzoil Building in 
Houston by the Gerald D. Hines Interests firm.
