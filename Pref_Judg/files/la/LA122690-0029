Tens of millions of dollars in Los Angeles mass transit construction contracts 
intended for small, struggling businesses owned by minorities or women are 
going to firms that do not appear to be disadvantaged or allegedly have acted 
as "fronts" for non-minority firms, The Times has learned. 
</P>
<P>
The "disadvantaged business enterprise" program has not worked as intended 
largely because of loopholes in federal rules and poor enforcement by local 
transit officials, records and interviews show. 
</P>
<P>
The Southern California Rapid Transit District and the Los Angeles County 
Transportation Commission overlook warning signs of fronting, fail to share 
important information, are slow to enforce regulations and are ignorant of 
crucial federal rules, The Times found. 
</P>
<P>
While minority contracting programs across the nation have been plagued by 
abuses, the stakes are especially high on Los Angeles transit projects. 
Officials say that of the $1.8 billion spent since 1985 on building the subway 
and light rail system, more than $471 million -- or 26% -- has gone to minority 
contractors. 
</P>
<P>
But interviews and transit agency documents cast doubt on how much has gone to 
companies that are truly disadvantaged, legally qualified to do the work and 
independent of large prime contractors, as required by law. Records for half a 
dozen minority contractors alone show that at least $50 million worth of work 
was awarded under questionable circumstances. 
</P>
<P>
The Times found: 
</P>
<P>
* A firm owned by a Panama-born businessman named John Benjamin Franklin 
received $7 million worth of minority contracts, but Franklin said that he has 
never suffered any disadvantage as a result of being Latino and that his 
company was highly successful before being certified as a "disadvantaged 
business." 
</P>
<P>
* An Atlanta company that was certified as "disadvantaged" boasted of obtaining 
more than $110 million in federal contracts last year and is partly owned by 
the treasurer of the United States. 
</P>
<P>
* A small, black-owned Los Angeles company that received more than $7 million 
in transit work was a front controlled by a tunneling consortium that was 
awarded $34 million worth of contracts, transit officials now say. 
</P>
<P>
* A woman is listed as the owner of a Van Nuys company that was awarded more 
than $7 million in contracts for disadvantaged businesses, but rival firms and 
transit officials complain that the company was set up as a front and is 
controlled by the owner's husband and brother-in-law. 
</P>
<P>
* An Asian-American company was awarded $3.4 million in contracts and was 
allowed to work for nearly a year although the firm did not have a valid 
contractor's license. Transit officials had evidence in their files indicating 
that the company was a front for a non-minority contractor but took no action 
to bar the firm from transit work until state officials charged the owner in a 
salary kickback scheme. 
</P>
<P>
Transit officials argue that the minority contracting program generally is 
working as intended. 
</P>
<P>
"The problems are the exceptions," said RTD General Manager Alan Pegg, who 
noted that the agency was lauded this year by the Los Angeles County Grand Jury 
for its method of certifying disadvantaged businesses. 
</P>
<P>
Leslie Porter, deputy executive director of the county Transportation 
Commission, declined to comment on The Times' findings but said that the 
commission and other public works agencies are attempting to improve 
communication among themselves and to streamline the certification process. 
</P>
<P>
Contracting programs for minorities and women have been beset by troubles from 
coast to coast. 
</P>
<P>
"The problem . . . is one of national significance," said David E. Wilson, 
chief of the criminal division of the U.S. attorney's office in Seattle, where 
federal authorities are investigating a fronting scheme in a $1-billion federal 
highway program. 
</P>
<P>
In Baltimore, state authorities filed criminal fraud charges in connection with 
alleged fronting on an airport construction contract. In Houston, city 
officials discovered two fronting operations, one involving a $2.6-million 
sewer contract. The National Assn. of Minority Contractors is investigating 
similar accusations in half a dozen states across the country. 
</P>
<P>
Minority contracts worth $1.5 billion are at stake in Los Angeles, where 
transit agencies have embarked on one of the country's largest public works 
projects. By completion in the year 2010, Los Angeles' planned 300-mile 
commuter rail system will carry a price tag of $7.5 billion -- and officials 
say at least 20% of that money is earmarked for contracts with disadvantaged 
firms. 
</P>
<P>
The rules for awarding such contracts are set by the U.S. Department of 
Transportation, which requires that transit agencies receiving federal funds 
attempt to award at least 10% of construction work to "disadvantaged business 
enterprises." 
</P>
<P>
Construction companies owned by non-minorities are required, when seeking 
transit jobs, to make "good faith" efforts to subcontract varying percentages 
of the work to disadvantaged firms. 
</P>
<P>
To be eligible to receive such subcontracts, a company must meet income 
restrictions and be at least 51% owned by a minority or a woman who controls 
the business. If a company's status as a disadvantaged firm is challenged, the 
owner may be required to show proof of suffering from chronic racial, ethnic or 
sexual discrimination. 
</P>
<P>
The RTD is responsible for applying such federal regulations while certifying 
and monitoring disadvantaged businesses that work on the Metro Rail subway. The 
county Transportation Commission bears a similar responsibility on the Blue 
Line and other light-rail projects. 
</P>
<P>
But loopholes in federal regulations allow businessmen who are not 
disadvantaged to be certified for minority contracts. 
</P>
<P>
When John Benjamin Franklin Jr. sought minority contracts on the rapid transit 
project, officials for the RTD and the Transportation Commission apparently 
were not obligated under federal regulations to find out if he had suffered 
social and economic disadvantage because no one challenged his certification. 
</P>
<P>
Franklin was born in Panama but raised partly by an aunt and uncle in Southern 
California. Born Juan Antonio Fernandez, Franklin subsequently took the name of 
his uncle, who was a descendant of Benjamin Franklin. As a teen-ager, he 
attended a private military academy in New Mexico, where he says his aunt sent 
him to keep him out of trouble. Franklin speaks Spanish fluently and English 
without a trace of a Spanish accent. 
</P>
<P>
By all accounts, Franklin built up his business through hard work and long 
hours. He told The Times that he has never suffered discrimination as a 
businessman and acknowledges that his company was highly successful before 
receiving minority certification. 
</P>
<P>
Orange County divorce records show that in June, 1982 -- less than a year 
before his company was first certified as a disadvantaged minority firm by 
Caltrans to do freeway work -- Franklin's community property included a 1979 
Mercedes, a two-story home on a hill in Mission Viejo, condominiums in Hawaii 
and Huntington Beach, and real estate in Whittier, Santa Fe Springs and in the 
area of the Colorado River. At the time, he also engaged in costly hobbies such 
as big game hunting and power boating. 
</P>
<P>
"Why should I get that advantage (as a minority subcontractor)?" Franklin said 
in response to a question. "My answer is I shouldn't. 
</P>
<P>
"Basically the program that's out there helped Franklin Steel immensely," he 
added. "It has not helped the common individual who needs a job." 
</P>
<P>
Nevertheless, Franklin maintained that he had a legal right to certification as 
a minority contractor. 
</P>
<P>
Transit officials agreed. He was awarded $7 million in transit contracts meant 
for disadvantaged firms from 1987 to 1989. 
</P>
<P>
Even after Franklin Reinforcing Steel exceeded the federal limit on earnings 
for small, minority companies, the company was certified as disadvantaged by 
the county Transportation Commission. 
</P>
<P>
As of the fiscal year ending June 30, 1988, Franklin Steel had averaged gross 
sales of $15.5 million annually over the previous three years -- nearly $1 
million over the $14.7-million federal limit. Still, it was certified by the 
county Transportation Commission as a disadvantaged company in August, 1988, 
and awarded $800,000 in Blue Line contracts during the next six months. 
</P>
<P>
The commission finally decertified Franklin Steel last February. By that time 
the company was averaging more than $22 million a year in gross sales. 
Commission officials said their tardiness was caused by an oversight. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Applying the Rules 
</P>
<P>
The Transportation Commission and the RTD sometimes reach opposite conclusions 
while applying the same rules, The Times found. 
</P>
<P>
Communications International Inc. of Atlanta is certified as a minority 
contractor by the RTD although the commission disqualified the company as too 
large. A $1-million minority contract is at stake. 
</P>
<P>
The telecommunications company was founded in 1979 by Joseph Profit, a black 
former football player for the Atlanta Falcons who is president of the firm and 
the major stockholder. The company boasts of obtaining $110 million in 
government contracts last year and of its ties to Catalina Vasquez Villalpando, 
the treasurer of the United States. Villalpando owns more than $260,000 worth 
of stock in the company, and documents in 1987 listed her as owning 10% of the 
firm. 
</P>
<P>
Communications International was certified by the RTD in 1985 and, according to 
agency records, began work on a $140,000 phone cable subcontract on transit 
district facilities, even though the firm did not have a state contractor's 
license to perform the job as required by law. 
</P>
<P>
Walter R. Norwood, head of the RTD's office of economic opportunity, told The 
Times that the agency certified Communications International because the 
company had shown the ability to perform cable work on federal jobs. RTD 
officials said the responsibility for making sure that the company was licensed 
rested solely with PacTel InfoSystems -- the prime contractor on the job. 
</P>
<P>
Prime contractors do have such a responsibility under state law, but a PacTel 
official said the company assumed Communications International was licensed 
because the RTD had certified the minority firm. 
</P>
<P>
"RTD gave us the name of (Communications International)," said Stephen Slocum, 
PacTel account manager. "So the assumption was that they had a contractor's 
license. . . . What government agency would certify you if you didn't have 
one?" 
</P>
<P>
In June, 1987, still without a state contractor's license, Communications 
International was certified as a minority firm by the county Transportation 
Commission, which at that time simply accepted RTD certifications without 
investigation. 
</P>
<P>
The next year -- as Communications International was about to be awarded a 
$564,000 contract for cable work on the Blue Line -- commission officials found 
that the company did not have the necessary license. 
</P>
<P>
Performing contracting work without a license is a misdemeanor punishable by a 
fine of up to $4,500 for a first offense, but state licensing authorities could 
find no record of a complaint. 
</P>
<P>
In the summer of 1988, Communications International obtained a contractor's 
license for "specialty" work such as low-voltage communications jobs, and the 
company was awarded the $564,000 Blue Line subcontract. 
</P>
<P>
Commission officials now say that Communications International made too much 
money to qualify for the contract and decertified the firm this year. The 
company reported average gross sales of $9.6 million for fiscal years 1986-88 
-- or $2.6 million a year more than the federal government allows for the type 
work performed on the Blue Line, according to Transportation Commission 
officials. The company reported $14.8 million in sales for the fiscal year 
1988-89. 
</P>
<P>
Despite the decertification of Communications International by the commission, 
RTD officials recertified the company this year and assured the firm that it is 
eligible to receive more than $1 million in Metro Rail contracts involving the 
installation of fire alarm and security systems and cable splicing. 
</P>
<P>
Norwood contended that the company is eligible to perform the work because it 
is certified as disadvantaged by the federal government. But federal officials 
said that such certification does not exempt companies from income limitations 
connected to particular jobs, such as the pending Metro Rail contracts. 
</P>
<P>
Profit, company president, insisted that Communications International has not 
exceeded federal size standards for minority subcontractors and is appealing 
the commission's decertification. 
</P>
<P>
Asked about the $110 million in government contracts described in the company's 
promotional literature, Profit said those projects may take years to complete 
and may not bring in that much revenue. He would not reveal how much money the 
company made last fiscal year. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Slow Enforcement 
</P>
<P>
Enforcement of minority contractor rules can be so slow that companies 
suspected of fronting are allowed to complete jobs and collect millions of 
dollars. 
</P>
<P>
In early 1988, RTD officials suspected that Doubleday Construction Co., a small 
black firm located in Los Angeles, was a front for Shank-Obayashi, a giant 
consortium formed by an American company and a Japanese business. 
Shank-Obayashi had two Metro Rail contracts worth $34 million. Doubleday's 
subcontracts for concrete work totaled $7.6 million. 
</P>
<P>
In a Feb. 15, 1988, memo, RTD officials asked the federal Department of 
Transportation to investigate, saying, "We have reason to believe (Doubleday 
Construction Co.) is a front." 
</P>
<P>
RTD officials termed the case "egregious" and accused Shank-Obayashi of 
secretly running the jobs that Doubleday supposedly performed. 
</P>
<P>
Both Shank-Obayashi and Doubleday deny that a front relationship existed. 
</P>
<P>
"That's crazy; I wasn't fronting for anyone," said Garland Smith, owner of 
Doubleday. 
</P>
<P>
Smith said that Shank-Obayashi leased him equipment and provided an experienced 
supervisor because Doubleday had never done such extensive concrete work. 
</P>
<P>
The help that Doubleday received, Smith pointed out, was not secretive and is 
spelled out in subcontracts that were available to the RTD. Officials of the 
agency said they do not routinely examine minority subcontracts. 
</P>
<P>
Despite prodding from the RTD, the federal investigation stalled and sputtered 
for more than two years. Finally last March, federal investigators told the RTD 
that Doubleday was indeed fronting for Shank-Obayashi. 
</P>
<P>
By that time, however, Shank-Obayashi and Doubleday had completed their work on 
the Metro Rail and had been paid. 
</P>
<P>
After receiving the results of the federal investigation, the RTD decertified 
Doubleday. 
</P>
<P>
Last June -- three months after receiving the results of the federal 
investigation -- RTD officials asked the U.S. Department of Transportation to 
bar both Doubleday and Shank-Obayashi from bidding on any federal contracts -- 
the harshest penalty available short of a criminal prosecution. The request is 
pending. 
</P>
<P>
But the RTD did not warn its sister agency, the county Transportation 
Commission, of its concerns about Doubleday until the commission inquired about 
the company last August -- 2 1/2 years after the RTD first recorded its 
suspicions that the firm was acting as a front and five months after federal 
investigators completed their probe. 
</P>
<P>
In the meantime -- in late February of 1988 -- a $900,000 minority subcontract 
was awarded to Doubleday by another contractor for work on the Blue Line 
light-rail project being built by the Transportation Commission. 
</P>
<P>
Norwood, head of the RTD's office of economic opportunity, said he had not 
notified the commission about the federal investigation sooner because it was 
not his responsibility. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm not required to tell (the commission) about it," he said. 
</P>
<P>
RTD spokeswoman Andrea Greene contended that it was the duty of the federal 
Department of Transportation to notify the commission of the allegations 
against Doubleday. Federal officials denied it was their responsibility. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Identifying the 'Fronts' 
</P>
<P>
Transit officials do not always use consistent standards to differentiate 
between fronts and legitimate minority firms. 
</P>
<P>
For example, transit officials have taken no action against Golden Bear 
Concrete Co. although the black-owned Cypress firm appears to depend even more 
heavily on a large non-minority contractor than Doubleday depended on 
Shank-Obayashi. 
</P>
<P>
Golden Bear Construction, owned by Henry Thompson Jr., has subcontracted for $9 
million worth of Metro Rail tunnel work from three contracting companies headed 
by Tutor-Saliba Construction Co. of Sylmar. The prime contractors are receiving 
a total of $131 million. 
</P>
<P>
Golden Bear crews on the jobs are hired, managed and laid off by Tutor-Saliba, 
according to Golden Bear supervisors and union dispatchers. 
</P>
<P>
"I leave the hiring and firing to them," said Tony Rivera, a Golden Bear 
supervisor. 
</P>
<P>
"Tutor-Saliba is definitely running this job," said Jeff Moseley, who was a 
Golden Bear foreman when he talked to The Times. "The only sign of Golden Bear 
(on the job) is the logo on (Rivera's) truck and the printing on your 
paycheck." 
</P>
<P>
Golden Bear also uses Tutor-Saliba's office space and leases equipment from the 
prime contractor. 
</P>
<P>
Federal officials say that such ties can be signs of a classic front. 
</P>
<P>
"The management and daily business of these minority firms must be controlled . 
. . (by the) socially disadvantaged owners," said Robert G. Owen, civil rights 
director of the Department of Transportation's Urban Mass Transit 
Administration. He said disadvantaged subcontractors must do their own hiring 
and firing, supervise their own work force and maintain an independent office 
and payroll system. 
</P>
<P>
But Norwood of the RTD said he is "comfortable" with the arrangement between 
Golden Bear and the larger company. "Tutor-Saliba is providing some 
assistance," he said. "And that seems like a good idea under the 
circumstances." 
</P>
<P>
Thompson and Eric Carlin, vice president of Tutor-Saliba, acknowledged that 
Golden Bear was receiving special help from the prime contractor because the 
minority firm was inexperienced in tunnel work, but denied that the 
relationship constitutes a front. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
The Gender Factor 
</P>
<P>
Firms claiming to be owned and run by women are frequently found to be fronts 
for white males in other parts of the country. But in a Los Angeles case, 
transit officials did not heed signs in their own files that a woman-owned 
company might not be what it claimed. 
</P>
<P>
Zeev Oved and Associates of Van Nuys, a firm that installs handrails and wall 
panels, was founded in 1986, according to RTD records. Zeev Oved, a white male, 
owns 35% of the company and his wife, Esther, owns 65%. 
</P>
<P>
After operating for four years as Zeev Oved and Associates, the company dropped 
the name of Esther's husband from the title last spring when the firm sought 
certification from the RTD as a disadvantaged woman-owned business. The RTD 
certified the company as disadvantaged May 1 and four months later the firm 
legally changed its name to Oved and Associates. 
</P>
<P>
RTD records show that Esther Oved had previously worked as a saleswoman for her 
husband's brother, Pinhas Oved, who operated a business similar to Oved and 
Associates. 
</P>
<P>
Pinhas Oved subsequently joined the new firm and handles estimates, bidding and 
supervision of jobs. Esther runs the office and says she manages the company 
along with her husband. 
</P>
<P>
"I worked for Pinhas," said Esther Oved, "and it's funny, now Pinhas works for 
me." 
</P>
<P>
In addition, another male relative, Jacov Oved -- a cousin of Zeev -- holds the 
contractor's license for the company. "I chose him because he had a license," 
Esther Oved said. "I was not qualified for a license." 
</P>
<P>
Between May and September, the company was awarded $7.8 million in 
disadvantaged business contracts on Metro Rail. 
</P>
<P>
In September, two competitors of Oved and Associates formally complained to the 
RTD that Esther was acting as a front for her husband and male relatives. 
</P>
<P>
"They want me out of the way," Esther said of the complainants. "I run this 
company." 
</P>
<P>
She went on to say that her brother-in-law, Pinhas Oved, does "man's work," 
while she controls the company from an office. 
</P>
<P>
"I can run my company from here," she said. "I do not need to negotiate with 
men." 
</P>
<P>
After The Times inquired about complaints against Oved and Associates, the RTD 
notified the company on Nov. 9 that it was being decertified as a disadvantaged 
firm on the grounds that Esther is not really in control. Officials based their 
action on information such as the history of the firm, which has been in the 
RTD file since the business was certified six months ago. The company is 
appealing. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
The Lack of Licenses 
</P>
<P>
In another case, transit officials not only overlooked evidence of a front in 
their files, but also failed to take prompt action when warned that a minority 
company was working without a valid state contractor's license and was involved 
in a kickback scheme. 
</P>
<P>
PIE Construction Inc., an Asian-American firm owned by Gregory C. Park of San 
Dimas, was awarded $3.4 million worth of minority subcontracts for electrical 
work on the Metro Rail in 1987. In July, 1988, the firm's contracting license 
was suspended by state officials for undisclosed reasons. The license expired 
two months later, but the company kept working. 
</P>
<P>
In December, 1988, investigators for the International Brotherhood of 
Electrical Workers complained to the RTD that PIE was operating without a valid 
contractor's license and that the company was forcing workers to kick back part 
of their salaries in order to keep their jobs. 
</P>
<P>
When the RTD took no action, the union turned over its complaints regarding 
alleged payroll kickbacks to state labor officials who filed criminal charges 
against Park in August, 1989. He pleaded guilty to accepting payroll kickbacks, 
was ordered to pay $178,000 restitution and was placed on five years' 
probation. 
</P>
<P>
RTD officials could not explain why the agency did nothing about the kickback 
complaint. 
</P>
<P>
While the union's complaint was pending, the RTD allowed PIE to continue 
working on Metro Rail subcontracts for several months without a valid 
contractor's license. 
</P>
<P>
PIE was forced to give up the jobs in May, 1989, but RTD officials permitted 
another firm that was partly owned by Park -- Citicon Inc. to immediately take 
over the two Metro Rail subcontracts. 
</P>
<P>
Park owned Citicon in partnership with George Dickey, a white electrical 
contractor. The company's certification as a disadvantaged minority firm was 
authorized by RTD economic opportunity chief Norwood, despite objections of a 
staff member who said that the white partner exercised too much control over 
the business. 
</P>
<P>
Three weeks after Citicon's takeover of the PIE contracts, Norwood changed his 
mind about Citicon and decertified the firm, alleging that it was a front for 
Dickey. 
</P>
<P>
"We find that the non-minority owner, George Dickey, exercises disproportionate 
control over the management and daily operations of Citicon Inc.," wrote 
Norwood on June 7, 1989. He also alleged that Citicon was set up by Park and 
Dickey to "subvert the certification and take over PIE Construction's RTD 
contracts." 
</P>
<P>
Even so, Citicon continued to work on the Metro Rail subcontracts for another 
three months. 
</P>
<P>
In addition, RTD records show that the agency overlooked early warnings that 
Park and Dickey might be operating a front. In November, 1988, and January, 
1989, a company called Airways Electric was listed, along with PIE, on 
certified payroll records as having paid PIE employees for work on Metro Rail 
subcontracts. Airways Electric is wholly owned by Dickey and had no official 
connection with the Metro Rail work, but again RTD officials took no action for 
six months. 
</P>
<P>
Norwood wrote on July 27, 1989: "It was determined that Airways Electric, owned 
by Mr. Dickey, and PIE, owned by Mr. Park, arranged to have PIE's employees 
paid through Airways Electric on both Metro Rail Contracts." 
</P>
<P>
"PIE appeared to be a front for Airways," RTD spokeswoman Greene said recently. 
She acknowledged that the RTD had not acted promptly on available evidence that 
pointed to a front. 
</P>
<P>
Park has denied acting as a front and Dickey could not be reached for comment. 
</P>
<P>
Norwood said the question of how RTD handled the case is moot because no firms 
connected with Park are certified to receive minority contracts and no further 
action is needed. 
</P>
<P>
But Gene Lyon, former electrical union investigator who worked on the PIE case, 
remains dissatisfied. 
</P>
<P>
"The RTD's shallow investigation of this whole thing," he said, "was a major 
display of ineptness and casts doubt on the RTD's ability to carry out its 
responsibilities." 
</P>

LOS ANGELES TRANSIT CONTRACTS TO MINORITIES AND WOMEN 
</P>
<P>
The Southern California Rapid Transit District and the Los Angeles County 
Transportation Commission had spent $1.2 billion on Metro Rail and the Blue 
Line by June 30, 1990. Of that amount $266 million-just over 25%-had gone to 
firms that the transit agencies had certified as disadvantaged minority-or 
women-owned businesses. By fall, the amount paid to such firms had increased to 
$471 million. However, a Times investigation revealed that tens of millions of 
dollars have gone to companies with questionable minority status, businesses 
that do not appear to be truly disadvantaged or firms that served as "fronts" 
for white, male-dominated prime contractors.

QUALIFICATION REQUIREMENTS 
</P>
<P>
 A firm owned by an ethnic minority or a woman must be certified as a 
"disadvantaged business enterprise" by the Southern California Rapid Transit 
District or the Los Angeles County Transportation Commission to participate in 
the equal opportunity program for construction contractors on local transit 
projects. To date the RTD has certified 371 firms. The commission has certified 
234, including some that are on the RTD lists. 
</P>
<P>
To qualify an applicant MUST: 
</P>
<P>
* Prove the firm is 51% minority-owned or owned by a woman. Minorities include 
blacks, Hispanics, Asians and Native Americans. 
</P>
<P>
* Have a state contractor's license to be certified by the commission. The RTD 
does not require such a license. 
</P>
<P>
* Gross less than $14.7 million a year. 
</P>
<P>
