William Kunstler (Op-Ed, Dec. 15, "Why Not Sell at the Local Pharmacy?") 
continues the cry for drug legalization. Typically he raises the specter of 
violence, illicit profits, etc. and reaches the perfectly logical conclusion 
that prohibition doesn't work.

Certainly, no thinking person would disagree with him. He fails, however, to 
point out that legalization (of alcohol, caffeine and nicotine) is hardly a 
howling success.

Since our society has been so unsuccessful in "educating and treating" the 
current crop of boozers, smokers and coffee drinkers, what in the world makes 
Kunstler and all the rest think that, once legalized, the control of the much 
more addictive and psychoactive substances such as cocaine, marijuana and 
heroin will be so simple?
