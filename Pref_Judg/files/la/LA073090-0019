If a band gets played on metal stations, flashes its chests in metal fanzines, 
has its T-shirts worn by Metallica and its videos played on "Headbangers' 
Ball," you might logically assume that the band in question plays metal. 
</P>
<P>
But a whole lot of punk and alternative bands have decided that shaggy locks 
and guitar solos aren't so bad after all -- ask Top-20 "metal" band Faith No 
More.

Hey, metal's just a marketing niche, man.

And the sold-out Danzig-Soundgarden-Corrosion of Conformity concert at the 
Santa Monica Civic Auditorium on Saturday night was a state-of-the-art survey 
of crossover shenanigans, three ways to approach sort-of-metal. Slam dancers, 
clean-cut college kids and extremely tattooed thrashers showed up in droves. 
</P>
<P>
South Carolina's Corrosion of Conformity, the spectacularly intense, hard-core 
trio that broke up a while ago, recently sprouted splendid manes of hair, 
recruited a few new members and became reborn as a speed-metal quintet looking 
for a major-label deal.

Saturday, singer Karl Agell aped the asthmatic three-note moaning of early 
Metallica, occasionally stopping between songs to recite a bit of apocalyptic 
poetry, while his guitar players alternated standard speed-metal wham-wham-wham 
with minor-key half-speed goth straight out of the Ozzy songbook. Agell's 
famous hypnotic stare barely made it past the stage apron. These days, CoC 
seems less corrosive than conforming.

Hot off a Grammy nomination and the headlining spot on a tour with Voivod, 
Soundgarden is still less a metal band than an art band with hard-rock 
influences, still more influential on college radio than on commercial 
hard-rock stations.

Chris Cornell is one of the few guys in alternative metal who can actually sing 
-- the standard comparison is to Led Zeppelin's Robert Plant, though Cornell's 
piercing wail has a plangency Plant's never approached -- and Kim Thayil's 
noisy, droning guitar sounds something like a postgraduate Fred (Sonic) Smith 
-- dissonance that rocks. 
</P>
<P>
But this was one of Soundgarden's first gigs in a venue much larger than a 
club, also one of the first with a new bassist, the third within a year. 
</P>
<P>
The Civic's boomy acoustics swallowed the complex arrangements, and its huge 
stage swallowed its onstage chemistry -- the tempos seemed close to collapsing 
at times. Even Cornell, the most charismatic front man in alternative rock, 
looked lost. 
</P>

Glenn Danzig, leader of Danzig, since his earliest days in the horror-punk 
Misfits has had a talent for wrapping his mainstream music in extreme 
packaging. In fact, if you hadn't been looking at the 15-foot horned skull the 
band uses as a drum riser -- or listening to the hail-Satan lyrics -- you might 
have mistaken Danzig for a vanilla fluff-metal group instead of the underground 
cult heroes they are. 
</P>
<P>
Danzig's growly voice, like an old blender, has two settings: hi and lo, mostly 
hi, which made for a monotonous set. 
</P>
<P>
When he got to a chorus, big REO-Speedwagon power chords let you know. And he 
plugged his singles and MTV videos between numbers, just like Warrant. This was 
metal -- of the most banal sort.
