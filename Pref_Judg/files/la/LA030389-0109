Responding to concern about the ozone layer, Environmental Protection Agency 
Administrator William K. Reilly called on the White House on Thursday to adopt 
a policy seeking to end the use of ozone-depleting chemicals by the end of the 
century, according to Administration officials. 
</P>
<P>
The proposal, made during a meeting of the Domestic Policy Council, came just 
hours after a surprise agreement by members of the European Community to take 
similar action. 
</P>
<P>
If endorsed by President Bush, the move would double the pace at which 
production and consumption of chlorofluorocarbons or CFCs -- the household 
gases that are destroying the Earth's ozone layer -- would be restricted under 
U.S. law. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
First Step in Effort 
</P>
<P>
EPA officials see the proposal as a first step in a wider effort to strengthen 
the Montreal Protocol, an international agreement signed by about 40 nations 
that calls for a 50% reduction in production and consumption of CFCs by 1999. 
</P>
<P>
The agreement was hailed as historic when it was signed in November, 1987, but 
the discovery since that time that the ozone depletion problem was far worse 
than imagined has led to wide spread concern that the treaty was not 
sufficiently strict. 
</P>
<P>
Since the treaty was signed, scientists have reported that during part of the 
year, the ozone levels in the stratosphere over Antarctica decline by nearly 
50% and that the ozone layer over parts of the Northern Hemisphere have been 
depleted since 1969 by as much as 6%. 
</P>
<P>
In addition, scientists warned last month that accumulations of the man-made 
pollutants high above the North Pole had left the ozone layer in the Arctic 
stratosphere "primed" for destruction. 
</P>
<P>
An EPA official said Thursday night that Reilly hoped for an Administration 
decision on the proposal as early as today, when he leaves for London to attend 
a 100-nation conference. 
</P>
<P>
The talks, headed by British Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher, will deal with 
the threat to the ozone layer. 
</P>
<P>
White House approval would give U.S. negotiators attending the meeting a head 
start in seeking revision of the Montreal Protocol, which is due to be 
officially reconsidered for the first time in May at a meeting in Helsinki. 
</P>
<P>
CFCs are used as coolants in refrigerators and air conditioners and as 
propellants in some spray cans. When in the atmosphere, they break down into 
chemical components capable of destroying ozone at a rapid rate. The process is 
exacerbated in the polar regions because of cold temperatures and other 
meteorological characteristics. 
</P>
<P>
Ozone, which is found in the stratosphere between 9 and 15 miles above the 
Earth's surface, shields the planet from the sun's harmful ultraviolet rays. 
</P>
<P>
Researchers believe that a mere 1% depletion in the ozone layer can increase 
the risk of skin cancer by 4% to 5%. 
</P>
<P>
At the London meeting, European and U.S. negotiators hope to persuade 
less-developed nations, including China and India, to restrict their CFC 
production. Neither nation has yet signed the Montreal Protocol. 
</P>
<P>
But the European decision Thursday and the Reilly proposal to the White House 
represent decisions by the developed nations to proceed with efforts to end CFC 
production even if other nations do not follow their lead.
