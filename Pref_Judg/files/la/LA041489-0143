A federal judge declared Thursday that red foxes are fair game for government 
trappers at a national wildlife refuge in Seal Beach, finding that the foxes 
can be killed because they pose a significant threat to two endangered species 
of birds. 
</P>
<P>
U.S. District Judge Robert J. Kelleher refused to grant an animal rights 
group's request for an injunction that would have prohibited the U.S. 
government from killing or maiming the foxes at the refuge within the Seal 
Beach Naval Weapons Station. 
</P>
<P>
Although a federal court trial is pending on a suit filed by the Orange 
County-based Animal Lovers Volunteer Assn., government officials said after 
Kelleher's ruling that they expect the trapping and killing of the animals to 
resume immediately. Trapping of the foxes had been permitted but killing them 
had been prohibited under a court order of last week. 
</P>
<P>
The Navy and U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service have ordered the trapping and 
killing of several hundred of the foxes since 1986, an effort they say is 
essential to preserve two species of birds on which the foxes prey: the 
light-footed clapper rail and the California least tern. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Foxes Not Natives 
</P>
<P>
Both birds are native to California and are listed nationally as endangered 
species. The red foxes, which are not native to California, are believed to 
have been introduced in the area many decades ago. 
</P>
<P>
The animal rights group challenged the trapping program almost immediately, and 
a legal battle that has pitted supporters of the foxes against those backing 
the birds has since been mired in federal trial and appellate courts. 
</P>
<P>
While the issue remains to be decided in the coming federal court trial, 
Kelleher made clear in his ruling Thursday that, so far, he finds the evidence 
overwhelmingly in the government's favor. 
</P>
<P>
In refusing to grant the Animal Lovers Volunteer Assn. a preliminary injunction 
to halt the fox trapping, Kelleher said he was strongly persuaded that to allow 
the red foxes to roam unhindered within the 5,000-acre weapons station "would 
jeopardize the lives of the two endangered species." The military site includes 
the Anaheim Bay National Wildlife Refuge, where the birds nest. 
</P>

</P>
<P>
Only 6 Clapper Rail Pairs 
</P>
<P>
Kelleher said he was particularly swayed by testimony Thursday from Richard 
Zembal, a U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service biologist who said that the population 
of the clapper rails has generally declined in the last few years to a low of 
only 6 pairs earlier this year. 
</P>
<P>
Although he knew of only a few direct sightings of the red foxes preying on the 
clapper rails, Zembal said numerous signs around the birds' nests -- such as 
fox hairs and tracks -- make the danger apparent. "There's no question . . . 
(the red foxes) are a predator," he told the judge. 
</P>
<P>
Kelleher said that Congress, through passage of recent environmental protection 
statutes, has made clear that when the interests of two competing species hang 
in the balance, an endangered animal should receive the higher priority. 
</P>
<P>
But officials with the Animal Lovers group, disputing Kelleher's findings, said 
they plan to press ahead for a full trial on the issue in hopes of gaining a 
permanent injunction against the government's killing of the red foxes. 
</P>
<P>
"I was absolutely flabbergasted by the judge's decision, because the hard 
evidence all points the other way from his decision," said Harold Baerg, 
president of the animal lovers group. 
</P>
<P>
He maintained that the government's policy in Seal Beach, in addition to moving 
toward the virtual extinction of a species of fox that was brought into this 
area, has inadvertently harmed other animals in the refuge as well. 
</P>
<P>
Indeed, U.S. Department of Agriculture trapper Craig Knight testified that in 
the course of catching about 84 red foxes last year, his traps also caught 60 
untargeted skunks, opossums and wild cats. Like the foxes, they too were killed 
by lethal injection. 
</P>
<P>
Federal officials could not say how many foxes still roam the Seal Beach site. 
According to Animal Lovers officials, about 263 of the animals have been killed 
by the government in the last 3 years. 
</P>
<P>
Assistant U.S. Atty. Robert B. Briggs said Kelleher's decision was an important 
affirmation of the government's position. He said he expects federal officials 
to complete an environmental assessment of the red fox situation in Seal Beach 
by November, as ordered by the U.S. 9th Circuit Court of Appeals in a decision 
earlier this year.
