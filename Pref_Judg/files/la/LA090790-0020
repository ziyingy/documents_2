With all the press given to turning George AFB into a major commercial airport 
(Col. One, Aug. 26) complete with high-speed rail links, it makes me wonder if 
there isn't a better near-term use for this site. Why doesn't the Pentagon 
relocate the Marines from El Toro MCAS to George AFB? This would keep George a 
military air base for which it was designed and allow El Toro to be used as 
Orange County's much-needed, Los Angeles-reliever airport.

George AFB is much larger than El Toro, is far closer to the Marine Corps 
facilities at Twenty-Nine Palms and Fort Irwin, and is still only 65 air miles 
from El Toro if close proximity to Camp Pendleton is a must.

Using George AFB as a commercial airport may make sense for the year 2000 and 
beyond. However, using El Toro MCAS as Orange County's commercial airport makes 
sense now.
