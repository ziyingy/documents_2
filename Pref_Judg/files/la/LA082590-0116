A fertilizer truck delivering piles of recycled sewage to homeowners? 
</P>
<P>
That may sound far-fetched to some people, but not to Bill Becker, general 
manager of the Southeast Regional Reclamation Authority. 
</P>
<P>
Becker is considering what could happen as a result of a pilot program now 
being conducted by the 12 member districts of the reclamation authority and the 
Aliso Water Management Agency. The program involves testing a mixture of sewer 
sludge and sawdust in experimental compost piles at Rancho Mission Viejo. The 
process could eventually allow Orange County sanitation agencies to enter the 
fertilizer market.

"Our trucks could follow the trash trucks and fill the empty trash cans part 
way with fertilizer that homeowners could use," Becker said. "That way we could 
recycle the material to residents in their empty trash cans instead of taking 
it to a landfill."

<P>
Sewer sludge is composed of the raw solids left after sewage is treated. Each 
person produces about a pound of sludge a day, Becker said. 
</P>
<P>
For the composting, two parts of sawdust are mixed with one part sludge and 
heated in the sun to produce a useful fertilizer that is relatively odorless, 
he said. 
</P>
<P>
Most county reclamation facilities now either dump sewer sludge into landfills 
or pay to have it trucked to sites as far away as Utah to be used in 
fertilizers, Becker said. 
</P>
<P>
Becker said the Orange County program is modeled after one in Los Angeles 
County, where sanitation districts use a 20-acre compost site in Carson and 
work with a contractor, Kellogg's Nitrohumus Co., to distribute the material. 
</P>
<P>
A site of about 3 acres in Chiquita Canyon is being used for the Orange County 
pilot program, and the Chino-Corona Nursery will test-market the material, 
Becker said. LEN HALL
