In a best-of-times, worst-of-times climate, representatives of more than 400 
grant makers and grant recipients nationwide gathered this week in Los Angeles 
to plot strategies for keeping philanthropy healthy in the face of federal 
budget cutbacks and staggering social problems. 
</P>
<P>
Delegates to the 10th-anniversary meeting of the Independent Sector were buoyed 
by some good news: A survey conducted for their coalition by the Gallup 
Organization shows that more Americans are contributing more money and time to 
causes and, significantly, those between the ages of 25 and 44, often depicted 
as me-first materialists, are leading the way in giving. 
</P>
<P>
Still, there was a pessimistic edge to messages delivered by speakers during 
the four-day session. The buzzword was diversity -- the imperative for 
not-for-profit groups to diversify their boards and their programs to meet the 
needs of a population that is increasingly multiethnic, multiracial, and split 
into haves and have-nots. 
</P>
<P>
As Independent Sector President Brian O'Connell said in an interview, "We are 
doomed to failure when people who don't know the problems first-hand plan for 
'those poor folks.' " 
</P>
<P>
Those problems include escalating poverty, hunger, homelessness and crime. 
</P>
<P>
Linda Wong, president of California Tomorrow, addressing the opening session, 
described a society in which there is an urgent need to rethink social, 
economic and political values and, at the same time, growing fragmentation and 
separation. 
</P>
<P>
In California, she pointed out, the majority of voters are 40 or older, white, 
with incomes of at least $40,000, while 40% of the population are people of 
color, poorer and younger. 
</P>
<P>
Will existing organizations be able to retool themselves to respond to meet the 
needs of the latter? "The clock is ticking away," Wong said. 
</P>
<P>
Raul Yzaguirre, president of the National Council of La Raza, zeroed in on 
predictable consequences of "undereducation" of blacks and Latinos. In 1988, he 
pointed out, three of four whites were high school graduates, but only five of 
eight blacks and one of two Latinos were. But by the year 2,000, he noted, only 
one in seven jobs will not require a diploma. 
</P>
<P>
The United States faces "a major mismatch" between needs and skills in the work 
force, Yzaguirre said. 
</P>
<P>
He called on foundations and corporations to fund public-policy analysis 
leading to educational reform, quality day-care programs and job training, with 
efforts concentrated on "the working poor." 
</P>
<P>
Peter F. Drucker, author and management consultant and a professor at Claremont 
Graduate School, told the nonprofit groups that they must sharpen their 
management skills and run their organizations "better than businesses." Whereas 
good intentions once were thought to be enough, he said, "Somehow, the Good 
Lord likes competence." 
</P>
<P>
He announced the formation of the Peter F. Drucker Foundation for Nonprofit 
Management, headed by Frances Hesselbein, formerly chief executive officer of 
Girl Scouts of the U.S.A. The foundation, funded by private gifts and royalties 
from Drucker's books and book cassettes, will reward an innovative nonprofit 
organization with a $25,000 award each year, starting in 1991. 
</P>
<P>
For the nonprofit sector, Drucker told the conference, the "key to survival" is 
to make donors active partners in decision-making. 
</P>
<P>
In the past, he told a news conference, people would be urged: "Join our board. 
You'll never have to do any work." Today, he said, a prospective board member 
demands a clear understanding of the mission and of his or her role in that 
mission. 
</P>
<P>
By an economic yardstick, nonprofits "are a declining industry," still getting 
only 2% of the Gross National Product, a percentage unchanged since 1830. 
Because "the biggest givers are older people," he added, "we face a sharp 
decline. If we don't reverse this . . . we'll be in serious trouble." 
</P>
<P>
The overall disintegration of community has drastically affected traditional 
ways of fund raising, Drucker said. "Even in a small town in Nebraska," he 
observed, today "nobody raises an eyebrow if you don't go to church" -- and put 
something on the plate. 
</P>
<P>
He spoke of the specter of a cut in allowable deductions to charities, one of 
the federal budget deficit-trimming proposals: "This is basically a way to 
enable the rich to be richer . . . now (they) have an excellent reason for not 
giving." 
</P>
<P>
With 750 member groups -- about evenly divided between donors (foundations and 
corporations) and the nonprofit groups they fund -- Independent Sector 
represents a range of interests and causes that is, to say the least, eclectic. 
As one speaker put it, it ranges "all the way from soup kitchens to the Ford 
Foundation." 
</P>
<P>
There are strange bedfellows: the American Lung Assn. and the Philip Morris 
Cos., the Child Welfare League of America and the National Council of Senior 
Citizens, the Sierra Club and the Weyerhaeuser Co. Foundation, the Fresh Air 
Fund and Chevron U.S.A. Inc., the Heublein Foundation and Mothers Against Drunk 
Driving. 
</P>
<P>
With an annual budget of $4.4 million -- most of it from grants, gifts and 
membership dues -- Independent Sector has lobbied to protect tax deductions for 
charitable giving, published resource manuals for nonprofits and, in 1986, 
initiated a "Give Five" campaign, asking everyone to give five hours a week and 
5% of their income to the cause of their choice. 
</P>
<P>
Discussion topics at this annual meeting included the role of funders and 
nonprofits in fighting AIDS, how to combat youth gangs, new directions in 
community care of the chronically mentally ill and civil rights strategies for 
the '90s. 
</P>
<P>
There was a good turnout for a session on "Prime Media; Prime Messages; Prime 
Time: Building the Right Matches." It promised tips on how nonprofits can 
influence the entertainment industry and get their messages into prime time TV. 
</P>
<P>
Panelist Paul Allen, director of communications for the Natural Resources 
Defense Council, part of the L.A.-based Environmental Media Assn. Consortium, 
cited as a positive example an association-initiated "Murphy Brown" episode on 
recycling. 
</P>
<P>
He cautioned cause-oriented groups to remember, however, that there are times 
when their message may get muddled -- "You're going to have to yield to art . . 
. people who need to create conflict and drama and emotion." 
</P>
<P>
And, he added, if the cause is to be given attention, it must be compatible 
with commercial success -- "The environmental bad guys" might just be the 
show's sponsors. 
</P>
<P>
Coalitions are the best approach, said Jerry Michaud, executive director of the 
End Hunger Network in Los Angeles. Among the networks, he said, there is an 
apprehension that "if we say yes to you, we'll have to say yes to everybody 
else." 
</P>
<P>
The End Hunger Network scored a notable success in December, 1989, with "Prime 
Time to End Hunger," a week during which popular series -- including "Cheers" 
and "The Golden Girls" -- on the three major networks focused on such social 
issues as hunger and homelessness. 
</P>
<P>
Michaud described this marriage of cause and prime time as a "phenomenon" of 
the last few years, but added, "the jury's still out" on long-term impact on 
the public. And the fallout has been that celebrities have taken up the causes. 
</P>
<P>
Allen, addressing the question of how effective these celebrities are as 
spokesmen, said the public is now "a little bit inured to that" and the famous 
must have "some meaningful connection to the cause" -- like the late Yul 
Brynner, who died of lung cancer, and the anti-smoking crusade -- and not be 
there solely to promote their own careers. 
</P>
<P>
Marlene Goland of the Center for Population Options noted considerable success 
in its efforts to encourage prime time shows to promote safe sex. "Four years 
ago," she said, "you couldn't say the word contraception on network 
television." Now, even sitcoms are writing safe sex into the scripts. The 
center is pushing for contraceptive advertising on the networks. 
</P>
<P>
But, asked the impact of these shows on teen-age pregnancy, she replied, "Who 
knows?" Teens are skeptical, Goland said -- "Basketball stars tell you not to 
use drugs and then drop dead from cocaine addiction. . . ." 
</P>
<P>
Increasingly, the Independent Sector has been examining ethics for nonprofits. 
Concerns range from "poaching" on one another's territory to commercialism of 
nonprofits through their endorsement of products or services. 
</P>
<P>
The preliminary report of the Independent Sector's values and ethics committee, 
presented at the meeting, is in part a response to a public questioning of 
nonprofits, fueled by media coverage of abuses, frauds and questionable 
operations. 
</P>
<P>
The offenders are "a tiny, tiny fraction," said president O'Connell, but any 
violation is "abhorrent" as charitable giving is "a transaction of trust and 
faith." 
</P>
<P>
The report addresses illegal acts, unethical behavior and what it defines as 
"ethical dilemmas." Examples of the latter: Is it acceptable to have a family 
member as paid head of the family foundation? Should grants be given to a 
corporation's potential detractors? Should a nonprofit dealing with a 
controversial cause publish its list of contributors? 
</P>
<P>
Ira S. Hirschfield, director of philanthropy for the Rockefeller Family &amp; 
Associates, who chairs the values and ethics committee, called this "gray 
domain" the major concern. 
</P>
<P>
Reviewing the report, Independent Sector members expressed their own ethical 
concerns: Do donors wield too much power over philanthropies? Are programs that 
"look sexy" funded at the expense of more valuable projects? Are some 
nonprofits guilty of designing programs whose major virtue is that a certain 
funder is sure to go for them? Should trustees of nonprofits be compensated? 
</P>
<P>
The biennial Independent Sector-Gallup survey, based on in-home interviews with 
2,727 Americans 18 and older from late March through late May, is the basis for 
the Independent Sector organization's talk of "a renaissance of philanthropy" 
in America. The study shows: 
</P>
<P>
* More than 98 million Americans -- up 23% from 1987 -- volunteered during 
1989. 
</P>
<P>
* 75% of households are contributing to charitable causes. The average 
contribution is $734, up 20%, after inflation, from 1987. 
</P>
<P>
* 86% of those between 35 and 44 years of age -- the baby boomers -- 
contributed to charities, the largest single group, while 64% of them 
volunteered time. 
</P>
<P>
O'Connell observed with satisfaction that the baby-boomers "are finally 
starting to behave like their parents and grandparents did," a fact that gives 
him "great hope." 
</P>
<P>
The survey also shows that the less affluent are more generous than the 
wealthy. In 1989, households with incomes under $10,000 gave 5.5% of their 
income to charities, while those with incomes of $50,000-$60,000 gave 1.7%, 
those earning $75,000-$100,000 gave 3.2% and those making more than $100,000 
contributed 2.9%. 
</P>
<P>
Overall, contributions reflected growing concern about social problems, with 
more support going to environmental, health and education causes and to 
youth-oriented groups. The losers included arts groups, which suffered a 17% 
drop in contributions, and international organizations, down 38%. 
</P>
<P>
Virginia A. Hodgkinson, vice president of research for Independent Sector, 
analyzed the findings for the organization. In an interview, she attributed the 
dip in contributions to the arts to tax law changes -- "The Van Goghs are now 
being sold at auction instead of going to museums" -- and the declining support 
of international groups to deepening concerns "about what's going on 
domestically" and the absence of a Page 1 international horror story that 
attracted mass giving during 1989. 
</P>
<P>
As for the generosity of the baby boomers, Hodgkinson speculated that many of 
them now have children and therefore are concerned about issues such as 
education and "about others in the community." 
</P>
<P>
Independent Sector President O'Connell said of the survey, "However good the 
news is on giving and volunteers, it's far inadequate to the hopes and dreams" 
of the people who are served by nonprofits. 
</P>
<P>
For government to trim its programs and transfer some of the load to the 
independent sector while talking about imposing restrictive tax laws is 
"grossly unfair," he added. Any floor on allowable deductions presents a "real 
danger" to philanthropic organizations, O'Connell added. If the floor is 5% 
this time, he said, "next time they need money they'll go to 10%." 
</P>
<P>
(The Senate budget proposal this time called for a 5% floor for those with 
incomes in excess of $100,000 a year. That means the taxpayer would be 
permitted to take only those itemized deductions that exceed the floor.) 
</P>
<P>
Independent Sector recognizes that, while talking diversity, the organization 
itself has a way to go in that area. Women and minorities, especially Latinos, 
are under-represented on boards of many of its member groups. It's pretty much 
"status quo," said O'Connell -- those on boards "think of those they know who 
are likely to be of their same ilk." 
</P>
<P>
It also recognizes that international interests and women's organizations, as 
well as major religions, are under-represented in its membership. Women, noted 
O'Connell, have "been kind of suspicious of anything that smacks of 
Establishment." 
</P>
<P>
Churches get 45% of all charitable contributions. There is a lesson to be 
learned there, O'Connell says: This giving does not reflect some sort of hope 
for salvation but, rather, the fact that "religious institutions are at the 
forefront" in tackling community problems at the neighborhood level. (TV 
evangelism accounts for only a fraction of church giving.) 
</P>
<P>
Independent Sector is talking about the need to target donors more effectively. 
The United Way-type approach, which seeks broad-based employee support through 
corporations, is "not going to work as well as it has in the past," said 
Independent Sector board chairman Eugene C. Dorsey, adding that it is a 
reflection in part of the growing number of small businesses with few 
employees. 
</P>
<P>
"People who have a conviction about that college, that institution, that 
hospice . . . that's the core of fund raising," O'Connell said, "people talking 
to people." 
</P>
<P>
At the 10-year mark, Independent Sector has seen several changes that affect 
its mission. One, said O'Connell, is a decentralization of government, with 
state and local governments more and more making decisions on "who can march, 
who can picket, who can raise money." Another is a growing demand to involve 
itself in international matters, giving how-to advice. 
</P>
<P>
In an address to the annual meeting, Adele Simmons, president of the John D. 
and Catherine T. MacArthur Foundation, spoke of "a real interest in helping" 
groups in the Soviet Union and in Eastern Europe. The MacArthur Foundation is, 
for example, setting up a think tank in Czechoslovakia. 
</P>
<P>
In Dorsey's view, the volunteer sector was sobered and strengthened by its 
realization, in the wake of the 1980s "revolt against welfarism" and resulting 
budget cutbacks that "government hasn't done a very good job" of delivering 
social services. "That may have been a good thing to happen," he said. 
</P>
<P>
More social problems, less federal money and a nonprofit sector that is 
one-tenth the size of the government bureaucracy struggling to fill the gap -- 
this is the outlook for the '90s. 
</P>
<P>
"We're not far from chaos," O'Connell said. 
</P>
<P>
Still, he believes that, increasingly, Americans are unwilling to tolerate 
poverty, illiteracy, homelessness, hunger. As they get involved in a single 
cause, he observed, "they begin to look at the systemic causes" and want to 
correct those. 
</P>
<P>
Dorsey is also cautiously optimistic. The answer, he said, may come from "the 
incentive of business and industry, an economic impetus" to ensure that in the 
decades ahead, there is an educated, drug-free, stable labor force. "The 
highest councils of corporate executives are looking at this problem." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Charitable Numbers 
</P>
<P>
The biennial IS-Gallup survey, based on in-home interviews with 2,727 Americans 
18 and older from late March through late May, determined that: 
</P>
<P>
* More than 98 million Americans -- up 23% from 1987 -- volunteered time for 
worthwhile causes during 1989. 
</P>
<P>
* 75% of households are contributing to charitable causes. The average 
contribution is $734, up 20%, after inflation, from 1987. 
</P>
<P>
* 86% of those between 35 and 44 years of age -- the "baby boomers" -- 
contributed to charities, the largest single group, while 64% of them 
volunteered time. 
</P>
<P>
* In 1989, households with incomes under $10,000 gave 5.5% of their income to 
charities, while those with incomes of $50,000 to $60,000 gave 1.7%, those 
earning $75,000 to $100,000 gave 3.2% and those making more than $100,000 
contributed 2.9%.
