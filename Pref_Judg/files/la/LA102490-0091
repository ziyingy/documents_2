The Ocean View School District Board of Trustees voted 3 to 2 Tuesday night to 
make the district the first in Orange County to ban smoking at all its schools 
and other facilities. 
</P>
<P>
The trustees' smoke-free policy, which becomes effective Feb. 1, prohibits 
anyone from smoking during school hours or during district-sponsored events 
anywhere at Ocean View's 17 schools, district administrative offices, 
maintenance yard and transportation facility. 
</P>
<P>
The prohibition eliminates smoking areas now designated at some of the 
district's schools and other facilities for teachers, administrators, 
custodians and other employees. 
</P>
<P>
Trustees Carolyn Hunt and Janet Garrick backed away from their previous support 
of the ban, saying they believe employees should still be able to smoke at 
designated outdoor areas. 
</P>
<P>
In conjunction with the smoking prohibition, the board agreed to schedule 
American Cancer Society clinics to help employee and parent smokers who want to 
kick the habit. 
</P>
<P>
Ocean View's decision marks the latest example of a growing anti-smoking 
movement among the nation's school districts the past two years. 
</P>
<P>
According to a 1989 survey by the National School Boards Assn., 17% of school 
districts nationwide adopted policies last year banning tobacco use. Among 
those was the Riverside Unified School District, whose smoking prohibition 
served as a model for Ocean View's policy. 
</P>
<P>
The Los Angeles Unified School District is scheduled Nov. 15 to enact a similar 
smoke-free policy, which its board adopted last month. 
</P>
<P>
In Orange County, the Fountain Valley School District currently has the most 
stringent anti-smoking policy. It forbids anyone from smoking inside 
district-owned buildings, but allows employees to smoke at designated outdoor 
areas as long as they are out of the sight of children. 
</P>
<P>
Among the county's higher-education districts, only the Coast Community College 
District prohibits smoking on all its properties. 
</P>
<P>
Ocean View's smoking ban is largely a symbolic statement to show students the 
district opposes tobacco use, trustees said. 
</P>
<P>
Among the district's 800 employees, only about 60 are smokers, according to an 
informal poll conducted in the past month by John Thomas, the district's 
administrator of pupil personnel. And, aside from 15 teachers who smoke, the 
other employee smokers rarely, if ever, are in the presence of children, Thomas 
said. 
</P>
<P>
"What we're talking about here is a public health issue," said Trustee Sheila 
Marcus, who proposed the smoking ban. "It is a statement that says if smoking 
is unhealthy for children, it's unhealthy for adults," 
</P>
<P>
Like most other school districts that have prohibited smoking, Ocean View faced 
only a diminutive pocket of resistence to its policy. A small group of 
maintenance workers who smoke argued the smoke-free rule should not be extended 
to the maintenance yard and other district sites where no children are present. 
</P>
<P>
In the coming weeks, district officials will continue finalizing details of the 
smoke-free policy. 
</P>
<P>
Administrators will continue negotiating with representatives from the 
district's two labor unions to decide how to enforce the ban and how violators 
will be reprimanded, Thomas said. 
</P>
<P>
Additionally, Ocean View is awaiting a legal ruling from the County Department 
of Education to determine whether to extend the ban to former school sites the 
district now leases. Many of those properties are used as day-care centers, and 
one has been developed as an apartment complex.
