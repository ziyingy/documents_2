In the "thirtysomething" era of aerobics videos for kids, fetal phones to talk 
to the not-yet-born and gourmet baby food, it seems inevitable that someone 
would produce music for infants. 
</P>
<P>
Fivesomething years ago, record industry veteran Ellen Wohlstadter, 35, was 
searching for music to play for her newborn son, Jason. Finding nothing she 
liked, she and her husband, David, 36, produced their own cassette with a 
variety of traditional lullabies such as "Rock-A-Bye-Baby," with ballads they 
grew up listening to written by the Beatles and other artists. Selling for 
nearly $10, primarily in baby furniture stores, the cassette was a hit. 
</P>
<P>
So with about $30,000, the couple started their own firm, called Discovery 
Music, a specialty music company that is becoming to infant music what the 
K-Tel label is to oldies and Windham Hill is to New Age music. 
</P>
<P>
From their comfortable, white-fenced home in Sherman Oaks, the Wohlstadters 
have released five cassettes of music for infants since starting their company 
in October, 1985. They include two anthologies of lullabies, one tape of songs 
with morning themes such as "O, What a Beautiful Morning," a cassette of silly 
songs and another tape of travel songs such as "Side by Side" to play in a car. 
Planned for release this year is a bathing cassette featuring "Splish Splash" 
and other songs. 
</P>
<P>
Discovery Music is still in the infant stage itself -- the Wohlstadters have 
only five employees -- but the couple closely guard their sales figures, citing 
competitive reasons. The Wohlstadters say that sales jumped 85% in 1988 and 
that they sell tapes in about 5,000 stores. Music industry executives say the 
market for music aimed at children under age 3 probably has grown from 
virtually nothing five years ago to $5 million to $10 million today. Some 
believe that Discovery may have as much as half of that market. 
</P>
<P>
As silly as it may seem to some, music for infants has become one of the 
hottest areas of children's music, which overall is a nearly 
$200-million-a-year business. Nashville music producer J. Aaron Brown, who 
sells a Grammy-nominated recording of original lullabies written by his 
in-house songwriters, said he sold 300,000 cassettes last year. Most were sold 
in gift shops, he said, which sell the tapes for $12.95. 
</P>
<P>
The business is starting to attract big-name companies, posing a threat to tiny 
Discovery. Walt Disney Records in Burbank earlier this year released "Disney's 
Lullaby Favorites," which includes a folk version of "When You Wish Upon a 
Star" sung by rocker Stephen Bishop, whose hits include "On and On" and "It 
Might Be You." 
</P>
<P>
Ellen Wohlstadter said she is nervous that large companies such as Disney are 
entering the market. "People say competition is good, but they have a lot of 
money behind them. They can do a lot of advertising and other things we can't 
do at this point," she said. 
</P>
<P>
Other major record labels are also considering whether to produce lullaby 
tapes. 
</P>
<P>
"We think it's a very fertile market," said Mark Jaffe, director of childrens 
marketing for A &amp; M Records. Jaffe said A &amp; M has yet to release a 
lullaby tape, mainly because it is searching for a singer the label believes 
can be marketed well. 
</P>
<P>
Much of the lullaby cassettes' success comes because the tapes aren't sold so 
much for infants, who most likely are indifferent to the music they hear, as 
they are marketed to parents in their late 20s and 30s to listen to while 
trying to soothe crying babies or put them to bed. 
</P>
<P>
That explains why one Discovery lullaby tape includes a cover version of Elvis 
Presley's 1950s hit "Love Me Tender" on the same cassette with the traditional 
"German Lullaby." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Nightly Music 
</P>
<P>
Still, some parents believe that their babies enjoy the music. Rosine 
Hermodson-Olsen, a mother in Frederick, S.D., said she is a strong believer in 
playing music for infants and went so far as to play music for her 7-month-old 
son, Joseph, while he was still in the womb. She said she plays Discovery tapes 
for him almost every night. 
</P>
<P>
"I play it if he's a little antsy or if his teeth hurt. I think it relaxes 
him," she said. 
</P>
<P>
Pediatricians interviewed said they see no harm in playing music for infants, 
adding that it is unlikely that children will develop Pavlov-type conditioning 
in which they must hear music to fall asleep. Pediatricians said their main 
concern is that some parents might be tempted to use music too often as a 
convenient baby-sitter, depriving the child of important human contact. 
</P>
<P>
"Music is all right, but it doesn't replace people," said Dr. T. Berry 
Brazelton, a clinical professor of pediatrics at Harvard Medical School and one 
of the nation's leading child-care experts. 
</P>
<P>
Part of the Discovery sales pitch is that music helps babies, although limited 
research has been done. One Discovery package says, "Research has proven 
parents who lullaby their babies promote bonding, infant development and 
speech." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Question of Research 
</P>
<P>
But Dr. Esther Wender, a pediatrician at the Long Island Jewish Medical Center 
who heads the American Academy of Pediatrics committee on early childhood, said 
she is unaware of any such research on the effect of lullabies. 
</P>
<P>
"I don't know of anybody who has studied it," said Wender, who added that she 
doesn't believe that listening to music would hurt a baby. 
</P>
<P>
Ellen Wohlstadter said she informally gathered research on the subject. One 
Swedish study she said she found concluded that it was important to sing to a 
baby, even if it is off-key. A news article, she said, told of a Japanese study 
that showed that babies were soothed more by lullabies than rock 'n' roll. 
Despite the statements on the packages, she said, Discovery does not emphasize 
psychological benefits of the music in selling it. "We promote it more as 
entertainment," she said. 
</P>
<P>
Discovery is based in the downstairs part of the couple's spacious home in the 
foothills. One room is an office, where orders are taken, publicity is planned 
and accounting work is done. The Wohlstadters, who share the title of 
president, also share an office in what used to be their bedroom, which has the 
guts of a new $40,000 computer in the closet. Discovery's shipping department 
is in a guest house in the back yard. 
</P>

TV Sports Producer 
</P>
<P>
Ellen Wohlstadter formerly worked in production and distribution for RSO 
Records, the New York record label owned by Australian Robert Stigwood that 
scored one of the industry's biggest hits in the late 1970s with the "Saturday 
Night Fever" movie sound track. David Wohlstadter is a television sports 
producer who does free-lance work on weekends for the ESPN sports channel. 
</P>
<P>
To produce a cassette, the Wohlstadters select a theme, such as travel or 
lullabies, and listen to hundreds of songs. A royalty of 5.25% is paid to the 
songs' owners. They also make frequent use of traditional songs in the public 
domain, which don't require royalties. 
</P>
<P>
Once songs are selected, singer Joanie Bartels, who was selected from a group 
of singers who auditioned for the job, records the songs, with cassettes 
duplicated at a plant owned by Warner Communications. Instrumental versions are 
usually recorded on the flip side of each cassette, with lyrics enclosed so 
parents can sing their own version of the songs. 
</P>
<P>
Selecting songs can be a sensitive job. One parent wrote to criticize the use 
of the traditional "Rock-A-Bye-Baby" because, the parent said, the song is 
excessively violent. The reason was that the song contains the lines: "When the 
bough breaks, the cradle will fall, and down will come baby, cradle and all." 
</P>
<P>
Another angry parent called Discovery at 9 p.m. a few weeks ago to complain 
about a 1986 tape that used a version of the Cat Stevens hit "Morning Has 
Broken." The call came after the former pop singer, who has changed his name to 
Yusuf Islam and become a strict Muslim, endorsed the Ayatollah Ruhollah 
Khomeini's death threat against Salman Rushdie, author of "The Satanic Verses." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Rejecting Tunes 
</P>
<P>
A large number of songs ultimately are rejected. For Discovery's latest tape on 
silly songs, a popular children's song called "Animal Fair" was nixed after it 
was recorded. The Wohlstadters were reluctant to issue the song because it 
refers to a monkey who gets drunk, sits on an elephant's trunk and ends up 
flattened. But, they said, most songs are rejected because they have some kind 
of romantic lyrics that parents might find objectionable. 
</P>
<P>
Part of the reason for Discovery's growth isn't so much the music as the 
Wohlstadters' decision to initially sell the cassettes through distributors to 
children's furniture stores and later to toy stores, children's book stores, 
children's clothing stores and department stores. The cassettes are usually 
hung on a stand that is placed on a store's front counter. 
</P>
<P>
Had they tried to sell the tapes to record stores, they said, the cassettes 
most likely would have been lost among popular adult albums more actively 
pushed by the record stores. Baby furniture stores made more sense. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
New-Mother Market 
</P>
<P>
"That's where the mother goes when she is pregnant. The new mother is the 
market we wanted to get, and the new mother does not go into record stores," 
Ellen Wohlstadter said. 
</P>
<P>
Discovery Music is starting to feel growing pains. The Wohlstadters expect to 
have to move to proper offices next year. In addition, an $80,000 advertising 
campaign, their first, is being launched in magazines for new parents. And they 
are considering whether to expand into such areas as compact discs and 
videocassettes. 
</P>
<P>
Still, she and others in the business believe that baby tapes won't be a 
thirtysomething-type fad. 
</P>
<P>
"People used to sing a lot to their children. People don't have the time today 
and often don't know the lyrics. You can say it's a fad, but if it was, people 
wouldn't be buying it as much as they are," she said. 
</P>
