Rabbi Dov Aharoni is a man of paradoxes. 
</P>
<P>
He rails against what he calls the spiritual emptiness of suburban American 
Jewish life, yet lives comfortably in one of the nation's pre-eminent suburban 
communities, the San Fernando Valley. 
</P>
<P>
He is a ferocious supporter of Israeli annexation of the occupied West Bank and 
Gaza Strip but admits that the greatest disappointment of his life was his 
unsuccessful attempt to adapt to living in a West Bank settlement. 
</P>
<P>
And although he counts himself among that generation of Americans who came of 
age in the free-thinking 1960s and '70s, his radicalization left him rooted 
even deeper in the authoritarian Orthodox Judaism of his upbringing. Rather 
than burn his draft card, Aharoni played out his days of rage on the streets of 
his native Brooklyn in support of the militant Jewish Defense League. 
</P>
<P>
Aharoni arrived in Los Angeles just three years ago, but already his ability to 
turn a phrase and his willingness to take the heat for controversial positions 
has made him the media darling of Los Angeles' growing Orthodox Jewish 
community. The city is home to between 60,000 and 80,000 Orthodox Jews, the 
second-largest concentration in the nation. 
</P>
<P>
Aharoni's essays -- often strident, uncompromising and sardonic -- are 
published regularly in the city's Jewish English-language newspapers, as well 
as on the opinion pages of The Times and other publications, extending his 
influence far beyond his small Woodland Hills synagogue, Beit Hamidrash 
Congregation. Articulate as well as literary, he is also a fixture on the local 
Jewish lecture and debate circuit, his views always to the right of his fellow 
panelists'. 
</P>
<P>
These views run the range of Jewish religious and political issues. "He seems 
to be able to take a position on everything," said Rabbi Jack Simcha Cohen, 
president of the Board of Rabbis of Southern California. 
</P>
<P>
Aharoni has lambasted the Jewish Federation Council of Greater Los Angeles for 
earmarking charity dollars for a mixed Arab-Jewish neighborhood in Israel 
rather than spending it at home on purely Jewish institutions. He routinely 
castigates Conservative and Reform rabbis for their less-stringent standards 
for conversion to Judaism, accusing them of turning the process into a 
money-making endeavor. 
</P>
<P>
He has written disapprovingly of Jewish teen-agers socializing with non-Jews, 
saying it might lead to intermarriage, and he has berated Jews for caring more 
about the homeless and other social concerns involving non-Jews than they do 
about strictly Jewish needs, such as the religious education of their children. 
</P>
<P>
Cohen, also Orthodox, said Aharoni is the first visible spokesman of the Jewish 
right wing in Los Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
"Is he the spokesman for Orthodoxy?" Cohen asked. "No. But there are quite a 
number of people in the Orthodox community who are very proud of him." 
</P>
<P>
"Influencing the public is the name of the game," added Rabbi Alan Kalinsky, 
West Coast director of the Union of Orthodox Jewish Congregations. "A good 
number of us in the community encourage him to publish as often as he can 
because we don't have anyone else who is willing to say it like he is." 
</P>
<P>
Not everyone is enamored with Aharoni. Reform Rabbi Isaiah Zeldin of Bel-Air's 
Stephen S. Wise Temple calls Aharoni "knowledgeable, even if I don't agree with 
him on many issues." Zeldin noted that the vast majority of the 600,000 or so 
Jews in the Los Angeles area are Reform, Conservative or secular and "would 
find most of what Rabbi Aharoni says to be anathema." 
</P>
<P>
One Orthodox critic of Aharoni is Rabbi Chaim Seidler-Feller, the highly 
liberal (by Orthodox standards) Hillel Council campus rabbi at UCLA. 
</P>
<P>
"He may be knowledgeable, but his views on Israeli politics fly in the face of 
Jewish morality," Seidler-Feller said. "Unfortunately, I think he reflects the 
views of a growing number of people in the community." 
</P>
<P>
Aharoni, boyish-looking at 36, clearly relishes all the attention. 
</P>
<P>
"Traditional orthodoxy was defensive about its views, but I see no value in 
playing the isolationist and tending to my small flock of followers," he said. 
"I believe in going on the offense." 
</P>
<P>
Aharoni insists that he has tempered his tongue considerably since his angry 
college years when he wrote his first book, "Jews for Nothing." In that volume, 
he charged that institutional Christian anti-Semitism is still a dangerous 
reality. Non-Orthodox, suburban American Judaism, he wrote, is a sterile 
religion of "nursing-home owners" that "extols the paganistic bar mitzvah . . . 
a religion of shameful Portnoys, bagels and sonorous ministers." 
</P>
<P>
"Ideologically, I haven't changed one iota," Aharoni said during a recent 
interview in his Woodland Hills home. "But I've mellowed out tremendously. I 
don't use the same terminology now as I once did." 
</P>
<P>
He points out that from an Orthodox perspective, he is a centrist on many 
theological issues. Unlike most ultra-Orthodox rabbis, he allows women to 
attend his religious studies classes and does not shun the non-observant. 
</P>
<P>
Aharoni came to Los Angeles following two frustrating years in Israel. He and 
his family moved into a new West Bank Jewish settlement with the intention of 
never leaving. He even adopted a new name, dropping the family name Fisch in 
favor of the Israeli-sounding Aharoni. 
</P>
<P>
"I went to Israel with the greatest of ideals," he said. "My commitment to 
aliyah (settling permanently in Israel) was as much as anything my reason for 
becoming a rabbi. And then I got there and one by one I saw my dreams turn to 
puffs of smoke." 
</P>
<P>
In his writing, Aharoni blames his disenchantment with Israel on that nation's 
struggling, socialist-driven economy and overbearing bureaucracy. In 
conversation, however, he admits that his failure to adjust also stemmed in 
large part from his fondness for middle-class American life. 
</P>
<P>
"We just didn't realize how much we had come to love our American life style," 
he said. 
</P>
<P>
Aharoni's return to the United States was facilitated by a sister who lives in 
Tarzana and put him in touch with Beit Hamidrash Congregation, a struggling 
Orthodox outpost that needed a rabbi. 
</P>
<P>
"So far, he's fit in like a glove," said Alan Shapiro, Beit Hamidrash's board 
president. "His being so public hasn't hurt either. He arouses people's 
curiosity, and that brings them to our synagogue."
