Legalization of drugs: Bravo! for all of us. I'm Colombian and as such I've 
suffered the horror that this last year's illegal business has produced not 
only to our Third World society, but to the American people. Violence has been 
the medium in which this demand-and-supply deal has taken place. I do not want 
youngsters depending on drugs and most of all I do not want youngsters seeing 
this business as the only way out of poverty.

Let's legalize, let's take the criminal part away from selling and buying. 
Decriminalization would sharply decrease the profit motive of the dealers and 
consequently decrease supply.

I'm a liberal, I never thought I'd agree with George Shultz!
