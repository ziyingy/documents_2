Your story, "U.S. Firms to Ship Soviets Billions of Cigarettes" (Sept. 14), 
prompted the following calculation: The 34 billion cigarettes that U.S. tobacco 
firms sell to the Soviet Union will cause the premature deaths of about 70,000 
Russians. Perhaps President Bush will approach tobacco industry leaders and ask 
them to supply the Iraqi army with their wares as well.
