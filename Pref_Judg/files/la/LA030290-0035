The Mission College baseball team is forced to play its home games at Valley 
College because it doesn't have a home field. 
</P>
<P>
"We work together and try to schedule things to accommodate each other," Valley 
Coach Chris Johnson said. 
</P>
<P>
Johnson, however, forgot about a Mission home game against Antelope Valley last 
month and wound up canceling practice. The disbelieving Valley players were 
left to watch the Mission game from the bleachers. 
</P>
<P>
Many of the Monarch players were similarly incredulous Wednesday after watching 
their 7-0 lead turn into an 8-7 deficit in a nonconference game against Mission 
at Valley. But Valley rallied in the bottom of the ninth to forge an 8-8 tie 
before the game was stopped because of darkness at the end of the inning. 
</P>
<P>
Valley (4-9-2) erupted for seven runs in the first two innings against Mission 
starter Nino Romo. The Monarchs sent nine batters to the plate in a five-run 
first inning. Designated-hitter E. J. Pape hit a two-run home run in the second 
inning to give Valley a 7-0 lead. 
</P>
<P>
"I was having trouble," Romo said, "My pitches were up early in the game and 
(Valley) kept on hitting them. I just had to relax and do a good job." 
</P>
<P>
He did. Romo stayed in the game and pitched 4 1/3 scoreless innings while his 
Mission teammates added four runs in the third, two in the fifth and one each 
in the sixth and seventh, to take an 8-7 lead before giving way to reliever 
Jose Garcia. 
</P>
<P>
"You've got to give (Romo) credit," Johnson said. "Not a lot of guys can hang 
in there after giving up seven runs." 
</P>
<P>
Mission (8-5-1), however, was not able to hang on to its one-run lead in the 
bottom of the ninth. 
</P>
<P>
Ed Aguilar was hit by a pitch to start Valley's ninth and Mike Osment, running 
for Aguilar, scored on back-to-back singles by Steve Ross and John Stephens 
(three for three). 
</P>
<P>
Ross and Stephens advanced to second and third with nobody out, but Nick 
Lymberpoulos, the fourth Mission pitcher of the game, came in to retire the 
next three batters, two on strikeouts. 
</P>
<P>
Eddie Chavez and Jesse Romero went two for four for Mission. Chavez belted two 
doubles and knocked in three runs and Romero had a single and a double.
