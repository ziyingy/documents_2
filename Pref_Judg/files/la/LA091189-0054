The Energy Department wants to curtail development of a nuclear reactor to 
power weapons for a space-based missile shield or for manned bases on the moon, 
the New York Times reported. The paper quoted federal officials as saying that 
the department wants to stop spending on the reactor because of rising budget 
pressure and opposition from private groups and Congress. The Energy Department 
now provides most of the funding for the 4.2-ton reactor, known as the SP-100, 
which is meant to generate 100 kilowatts of electricity and to fit in the space 
shuttle. One Pentagon official told the newspaper the proposed cut would leave 
the reactor program "severely crippled." But other officials who were not 
identified said the proposed cut could be a ploy to get other federal agencies 
to increase their financial support.
