<P>
Lei Feng is a most unlikely hero. 
</P>
<P>
A military man who died in a ridiculous accident, Lei Feng was a naive 
do-gooder whose highest goal was to be a "rustless screw" in the great machine 
of communism. 
</P>
<P>
His short life, according to official histories, came to an abrupt end in 1962, 
when one of his comrades backed a truck into a utility pole. Lei, 22, failed to 
dodge, and the falling pole killed him. 
</P>
<P>
An ignominious end? Not at all. The next year, Chairman Mao Tse-tung himself 
called on the entire nation to "learn from Lei Feng." 
</P>
<P>
The resulting movement faded in the mid-1980s, as attention turned to material 
incentives and economic development. But now China is in the midst of a Lei 
Feng revival, thanks largely to last June's massacre of pro-democracy 
protesters in Beijing. 
</P>
<P>
What's going on here? 
</P>
<P>
Many things, at many levels. 
</P>
<P>
For one thing, Lei has lots of company in a long and mostly honorable tradition 
of model figures. 
</P>
<P>
There's the Foolish Old Man who moved the mountain, the hero of an old fable 
about perseverance. Mao revised the old man's story into a political tract on 
fighting imperialism. Then there are historical figures like the Song Dynasty 
general, Yue Fei, a model of patriotism for generations of schoolchildren. And 
there are new heroes like Lai Ning, a 14-year-old boy who died fighting a 
forest fire. 
</P>
<P>
The use of moral suasion to educate and control the masses is quintessentially 
Chinese, with roots more than 2,000 years old. In the Communist era, Mao and 
his comrades could make good use of figures like Lei, an army truck driver who 
did voluntary work on construction projects and happily gave money to peasants. 
</P>
<P>
"Chinese society from the beginning has this sense of people learning from good 
examples, rather than from sanctions imposed on them," commented Jerome A. 
Cohen, a former Harvard law professor living in Hong Kong. "It goes back to the 
whole Confucian ideal that rules and regulations are a last resort, that the 
good ruler sets the standard to which all should repair. The Communists built 
upon this." 
</P>
<P>
Is it really surprising that the old men who crushed last spring's protests 
reach out nostalgically to a safely dead, good-hearted soldier who washed his 
comrades' socks without even being asked, and who, more important, never ever 
questioned authority? Who better to help refurbish the army's sullied image and 
promote social stability? 
</P>
<P>
So what if sophisticated and cynical urbanites mock the new Lei Feng campaign? 
So what if despised "bourgeois liberals," tainted by Western ideas of 
individual rights, joke that the main thing to be learned from Lei Feng is to 
watch out for falling telephone poles? 
</P>
<P>
Yang Baibing, 70, responsible for political controls within the army, declared 
in a speech launching the new campaign that Lei "will forever be a brilliant 
example from which to learn." 
</P>
<P>
He then outlined the intended lessons: 
</P>
<P>
* Love for the Communist Party and hatred of class enemies. 
</P>
<P>
* Obedience to the party. 
</P>
<P>
* Selfless service to the people. 
</P>
<P>
* Thrifty living. 
</P>
<P>
* Hard work in any assignment. 
</P>
<P>
Yang also left no doubt that the campaign will press the claim that martial-law 
troops acted honorably in their June assault in Beijing, which left hundreds 
and perhaps thousands of civilians dead. 
</P>
<P>
"In the struggle to stop turmoil and quell the counterrevolutionary rebellion . 
. . the units that implemented the tasks of enforcing martial law performed in 
an outstanding manner," Yang declared. "Their deeds can be described as a 
reappearance of the spirit of Lei Feng." 
</P>
<P>
Old Lei Feng movies are now airing on television, while a new TV series is 
being created. Newspaper articles sing his praises and publicize new examples 
such as Zhang Zixiang, a "model soldier of the Lei Feng type" who gained fame 
earlier this year for repairing thousands of his comrades' home appliances 
free. Work units and schools organize public service activities in the name of 
studying Lei Feng. 
</P>
<P>
Some people respond to all this with pure cynicism, others with seemingly 
unquestioning acceptance. Many have mixed feelings, believing that Lei was 
indeed a good person but that his legacy is being abused. 
</P>
<P>
"I think everyone should try to be like Lei Feng," commented a middle-aged 
scientist. "But I don't like it when this is used for other purposes . . . like 
promoting the image of the army." 
</P>
<P>
Lei's greatest influence is in schools, where his name and that of Lai, the 
teen-age forest-fire-fighting martyr, are often linked. 
</P>
<P>
"Through the campaign of learning from Lai Ning and Lei Feng, the students have 
begun to consider the question of what is their world outlook," said Zhang 
Peilan, a math teacher at a Beijing middle school. "Before learning from Lai 
Ning, some of our students would compete about who could spend more money, who 
ate well, who had the more fashionable clothing." 
</P>
<P>
Qi Xiaobin, a high school junior, explained how students should learn to place 
collective interests first. 
</P>
<P>
"Lei Feng never had a sense of individualism," she said. "He acted for the 
public welfare. . . . When people consider their individual interests and 
collective interests, they must consider which is more important. . . . For 
example, when a test is coming soon but we also have a big classroom cleaning 
activity, should we participate in this program or go home and study? In this 
kind of situation, we have to make a distinction between individualism and 
collectivism. . . . We should participate and not say that because we have to 
study we can't come." 
</P>
<P>
Even many adults who are cynical about this latest Lei Feng movement believe 
that education based on model individuals can be good for children. 
</P>
<P>
But among the partially Westernized, urban intellectual elite of today's China, 
many believe that the Lei Feng campaign has it all wrong -- that what China 
actually needs is to abandon the whole Confucian legacy of meek obedience to 
authority. 
</P>
<P>
"I think Lei Feng was just a stupid young soldier," said a graduate student. 
"He didn't really understand anything about our government. He was just 
obedient. This is the kind of people our government wants. They want to hold 
back society, because they know that if it develops, the government will crash 
down."
