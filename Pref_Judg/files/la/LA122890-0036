It's the time to make New Year's resolutions, and even veteran shoppers like us 
could use some improvement. Here are our 1991 resolutions for less pig-headed, 
cranky and calorie-filled shopping trips: 
</P>
<P>
* We resolve to only buy what we can't possibly live without and looks 
fantastic on us. We will ignore our mother's voice echoing, "But those sensible 
beige mid-heel pumps are only $10!" and realize that nothing is a bargain if 
you never wear it. We swear we'll never buy another thing on impulse again; it 
has to call our name and cry out to us to take it home. 
</P>
<P>
* We resolve never, ever to say what we'd really like to say to the 39th 
salesclerk of the day who asks us: "Hi! How are you doing?" We'll refrain from 
exploding: "'We were doing just fine until 512 salesclerks inquired about the 
state of our mental health in the space of the last two hours." Rather, we'll 
calmly explain to their employers, "Stop instructing your sales staff to act 
like trained seals! Let your sales associates know that there are many, many 
ways to greet customers without sounding and looking like smiling robots. Use 
some discretion. If people look as if they want help, help them. If they look 
as if they want to be left alone, stay out of their faces." 
</P>
<P>
* We resolve to eat before we shop, or plot other strategies that enable us to 
avoid the cholesterol courts at our favorite malls. 
</P>
<P>
* We resolve not to buy anything (especially swimsuits, which are not always 
returnable) when we use shopping as an antidote to depression. While shopping 
provides a great temporary lift, we've noticed that things we buy when we don't 
feel great look like they belong in Lisa Bonet's wardrobe as soon as we get 
them home. Of course, we'll still shop when we feel down -- we just won't bring 
any money, checks or credit cards with us. 
</P>
<P>
* Conversely, we resolve to shop when we're already feeling great. It's amazing 
how being in a good mood when we start out affects whether we go home with 
gorgeous, perfect-fitting bargains . . . or Marge Simpson rejects. 
</P>
<P>
* We resolve to be better customers, to thank salesclerks when they do a good 
job and to call or write the store manager when they do an exceptional one. If 
a clerk is harried because the store is understaffed, we won't channel our 
anger and hostility toward him or her; it's the manager's job to have adequate 
help. And should we be treated unfairly by a salesperson, we will let the 
manager know right away that if the store doesn't want our money, we'll take it 
elsewhere. 
</P>
<P>
* We resolve to be a more environmentally conscious shoppers. As much as we 
love collecting shopping bags, we realize that there are trees out there that 
deserve to live. A friend of ours found this enormous screaming yellow tote bag 
(pictured) at the new Ikea store in Burbank for a mere $2.50 that will carry a 
multitude of purchases. Even the most fervent shopper will be hard-pressed to 
fill it to capacity. We also resolve to let companies know when they are guilty 
of over-packaging their products; you know, a box inside a box inside a box, 
wrapped in plastic and then another box. Enough's enough. 
</P>
<P>
* We resolve not to force friends and family into accompanying us on shopping 
trips. No longer will we drag cranky toddlers, surly boyfriends, bored husbands 
or impatient siblings on our buying treks. If it means shopping alone, so be 
it. It's a dirty job, but someone has to do it. 
</P>
<P>
* We resolve to abstain from shop-till-you-drop marathons unless they are 
absolutely necessary. Instead, we'll shop more frequently for shorter 
durations. Too much shopping is like eating three corn-dogs-on-a-stick followed 
by a Mrs. Fields' chaser; the memory lingers far too long. 
</P>
<P>
* We resolve to rid our closets of those tired pouf skirts and give away other 
un-needed items to friends or charity more frequently. That way we'll reap more 
pleasure and suffer less guilt when updating our wardrobes.
