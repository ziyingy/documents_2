Fontela had been celebrating the birthday of a friend, Teodorico Torres, 28, 
the night before with a barbecue chicken dinner on the patio of Torres' 
apartment, Rodriguez said. Torres and his roommate, Guadalupe Rodriguez, 28, 
brought the barbecue inside about 11 p.m. and left it in the kitchen, Sgt. 
Rodriguez said. Torres told police that he checked and thought the coals were 
extinguished when the three men went to sleep.
