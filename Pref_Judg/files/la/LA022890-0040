Israel and Poland resumed full diplomatic relations after a 23-year break.

Poland became the third Warsaw Pact country to renew relations with the Jewish 
state in the last six months. Warsaw severed relations during the 1967 Middle 
East War. Hungary restored relations in September, and Czechoslovakia followed 
suit Feb. 9. Poland has had low-level ties with Israel since 1987, and the new 
Solidarity-led government is hoping that the restoration of a formal embassy 
will lead to closer economic and cultural cooperation.
