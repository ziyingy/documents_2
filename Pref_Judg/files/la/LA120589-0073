President Bush's proposal to negotiate a global warming treaty at a U.S. 
conference next year -- a reversal of his position just six weeks ago -- 
followed weeks of criticism of his cautious approach and the conversion of his 
chief science adviser to the idea, scientists, environmentalists and government 
officials said Monday. 
</P>
<P>
D. Allan Bromley, Bush's science adviser, met with experts on global warming 
two weeks before the Malta summit to be briefed on scientific evidence on the 
phenomenon. A participant at the meeting concluded, based on remarks Bromley 
made, that the once-reluctant science adviser had a change of heart after he 
"got up on the learning curve" of the science, was "beaten up" by Congress for 
moving slowly, and realized that European nations would charge ahead without 
the United States if Bush continued to drag his feet. 
</P>
<P>
Bush's invitation to hold the session represents a response to international 
and domestic criticism of his previous go-slow approach and suggests that the 
White House is now willing to afford global warming the importance already 
granted it by several other Western nations. The decision also indicates a 
softening of skepticism on the issue by Bromley. 
</P>
<P>
"Clearly, Dr. Bromley seems to be warming up to global warming," said an 
Administration source who declined to be identified. "This is far and away a 
more progressive position for the United States to take. . . . It looks as if 
some people have begun to realize that the politics of global warming is pretty 
important here." 
</P>
<P>
But Sen. Albert Gore (D-Tenn.), one of the chief congressional critics of the 
Administration's handling of global warming, remained dubious of the White 
House move. 
</P>
<P>
"The only thing Bromley has discovered in the last month is political reality," 
Gore said. 
</P>
<P>
Environmental Protection Agency chief William Reilly had previously sought 
unsuccessfully to persuade Bush to call for a treaty-writing conference. 
Reilly's proposal was rejected by the White House Domestic Policy Council six 
weeks ago at the urging of Bromley and White House Chief of Staff John H. 
Sununu. 
</P>
<P>
At the time, Bromley was "semi-ignorant" on the subject and wanted to "go 
slow," recalled Michael Oppenheimer, a senior Environmental Defense Fund 
scientist who helped brief Bromley two weeks ago. 
</P>
<P>
"With Bromley on (Reilly's) side -- a well-respected scientist and the top 
technical man in government -- the odds changed a little bit," Oppenheimer 
said. "I think Bromley changed because he is a man of reason. He was made to 
focus on the issue because of politics but . . . his judgment is a technically 
sound one." 
</P>
<P>
The burning of oil, coal and other fossil fuels that create carbon dioxide and 
the destruction of forests that absorb the gas are causing a warming of the 
atmosphere that scientists say could turn verdant pastures into deserts and 
cause sea levels to rise. The United States and the Soviet Union together 
produce more than 40% of the world's carbon dioxide emissions. 
</P>
<P>
Experts agree that the phenomenon, known as the greenhouse effect, will bring 
about climatic changes but do not agree on when they will occur or on their 
severity. For example, there is still uncertainity over exactly how the warming 
trend will affect the frequency and intensity of hurricanes and droughts. 
</P>
<P>
F. Sherwood Rowland, a chemistry professor at UC Irvine who pioneered research 
on the destruction of the Earth's ozone layer, said Bromley's background gives 
him more clout than previous scientific advisers. Bromley is a nuclear 
physicist from Yale University. 
</P>
<P>
At a world conference hosted by the the Netherlands the week after the Domestic 
Policy Council debate, relations between the EPA administrator and the science 
adviser appeared to be delicate, and representatives of environmental groups 
publicly charged that Bromley had been sent to the meeting as a White House 
watchdog. 
</P>
<P>
After the United States and Japan succeeded in watering down a declaration that 
called for stabilization of greenhouse gas emissions by the turn of the 
century, the Administration was denounced by members of both parties of 
Congress and other industrial nations that wanted to forge a major agreement. 
</P>
<P>
Bromley told The Times over the weekend that Bush's change had come about 
because "we know a lot more now than we knew even a few months ago." Several 
scientific experts on global warming said Monday there have been no major new 
findings on the warming trend in recent months, nor any new conclusions or 
reports on its economic repercussions. 
</P>
<P>
"Absolutely nothing," said Gordon MacDonald, chief scientist and vice president 
of the Miter Corp., a Virginia-based nonprofit business that works with the 
Department of Defense in the design and development of computer and radio 
systems. 
</P>
<P>
MacDonald, a greenhouse-effect expert who attended the recent session with 
Bromley, called it an "educational" meeting. "He was very much interested in 
what the state of science is, what we knew and what we didn't," recalled 
MacDonald. 
</P>
<P>
MacDonald said Bromley made it clear that global warming now has his attention 
and he wants "to learn" about it. 
</P>
<P>
Rafe Pomerance, a global warming expert at the World Resources Institute, a 
Washington-based environmental think tank, said Bromley has been "on a steep 
learning curve" since early congressional hearings, when "his knowledge of the 
issues was not very complete." 
</P>
<P>
Even before the President's call for the negotiating meeting, Administration 
officials had indicated that the United States might be prepared to begin work 
on an accord next year. The Bush Administration is not expected to unveil its 
own program and targets for reducing emissions of carbon dioxide and other 
greenhouse gases until the World Meteorological Convention next November in 
Geneva. 
</P>
<P>
Administration officials said that Bush told Reilly in a brief telephone call 
Thursday that he would call for a conference with the United States as host. 
The President had not discussed greenhouse policy with Reilly since the Holland 
meeting, although Reilly has met several times with Bromley and Sununu.
