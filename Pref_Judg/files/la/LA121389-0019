Drugs, including cocaine and heroin, should be legalized, taxed and dispensed 
by the state because the war on drugs is being lost, U.S. District Judge Robert 
W. Sweet said in a New York City speech. The result, he said, "would be the 
elimination of the profit motive, the gangs, the drug dealers." Sweet said the 
effort to stem the drug epidemic by jailing more people is not working. Sweet 
said he believes the root cause of the drug epidemic is the attraction of high 
profits for those in poverty.
