In an entry from his published "Notebooks, 1960-1977," Athol Fugard comes up 
with a seemingly improbable quote from Queen Victoria: "No civilization is 
complete that does not make provision for the dumb and defenseless creatures of 
God's creation." 
</P>
<P>
Improbable for her maybe, but not for him. The one constant of Fugard's plays 
-- aside from their inextricable link with his native South Africa -- is his 
extraordinarily deep, even profound, human sympathy, which is not to be 
confused with sentimentality. It's a rigorous, closely observed, punishingly 
detailed identification with his characters and their situations that reaches 
so deep that it seems to collect like blood around a basic human root -- just 
the way South Africa itself appears compressed on the bottom of the world like 
the tapered base of an immense geographic tooth. 
</P>
<P>
What Harold Pinter said of Samuel Beckett could also be said of Fugard, who has 
rivaled Beckett as the English-speaking world's pre-eminent playwright: "He 
leaves no stone unturned and no maggot lonely." The similarity rests on 
Fugard's uncanny ability to get to the heart of a matter and find those 
sympathies that far transcend specifics -- he's a regional writer whose 
penetration of locale has helped make South Africa an international metaphor 
for sorrow and racial strife, for the personal human breath imperishably alive 
under a brutal political machine and modernism's leveling abstractions. He's 
won numerous awards, including two Tonys. It's not unlikely that at some point 
in his career he could win a Nobel Prize. 
</P>
<P>
His latest play, "My Children! My Africa!," which has its West Coast premiere 
at the La Jolla Playhouse Aug. 26, deals with a black township schoolboy and a 
white schoolgirl who are brought together by a black teacher, Mr. M., to 
represent their school in regional debates. They begin by debating each other. 
The speech by the black student, Thami, says in part: 
</P>
<P>
"The opposition has spoken about sexual exploitation and the need for women's 
liberation. Brothers and sisters, these are foreign ideas. Do not listen to 
them. They come from a culture, the so-called Western Civilization, that has 
meant only misery to Africa and its people. It is the same culture that shipped 
away thousands of our ancestors as slaves, the same culture that has exploited 
Africa with the greed of a vulture during the period of colonialism, and the 
same culture which continues to exploit us in the 20th Century under the 
disguise of concern for our future." 
</P>
<P>
Counters Isabel, the schoolgirl: "I believe most strongly that there are values 
and principles in traditional African society which could be studied with great 
profit by . . . Western Civilization. But at the same time, I know, and you 
know, that Africa no longer lives in that past. For better or worse, it is part 
now of the 20th Century and all the nations on this continent are struggling 
very hard to come to terms with that reality. Arguments about sacred 
traditional values . . . are used by those who would like to hold back Africa's 
progress and keep it locked up in the past." 
</P>
<P>
Is this an obscure high school in the South African Karoo, or is it the streets 
of racially divided Bensonhurst, where black crowds yell at each other about 
who is more African than whom? 
</P>
<P>
"I always set out to show a brotherhood," Fugard said recently, as he was 
gearing up for rehearsals at the Playhouse. His associate director and longtime 
friend, Susan Hilferty, also works as a designer with the Playhouse and was 
instrumental in bringing the play there 
</P>
<P>
instead of to the Mark Taper Forum, where Fugard's plays normally have their 
local debuts. 
</P>
<P>
"With 'My Children! My Africa!,' it was time to acknowledge the extraordinary 
inspiration of young South Africans. 1984 was a period of great unrest in South 
Africa. It looked like that was the year when the country was going to blow 
apart. It's inexplicable how certain things touch you on the shoulder and say, 
'Remember me? We have an appointment.' The front pages of the newspapers were 
full of the horrors of the period. But it was this little item that stopped me. 
In a small hinterland Karoo town, a mob of blacks assaulted a teacher and 
necklaced him. That was all. Those were the facts." ("Necklacing" refers to 
murdering someone by igniting a gasoline-soaked tire around his neck.) 
</P>
<P>
At the moment, his thoughts were divided between the play and the daily 
political developments in South Africa, which he was monitoring closely. Where 
once he said, "I cannot see sanity prevailing in South Africa," now he was 
feeling cautious optimism. 
</P>
<P>
"The whites know this old system has to go," Fugard said. "The unbanning of the 
African National Congress and the South African Communist Party, the freeing of 
political prisoners, the unbanning of all the people who'd been silenced under 
court order, and the release of Nelson Mandela -- at first I didn't believe it. 
For years the government had created an atmosphere of suspicion, but now I 
think it's imperative to give the government trust. . . . It's amazing to see 
how how rich Mandela is and how stunted is (president Frederik W.) de Klerk's 
capacity for soulful giving -- though it's clear he's struggling with the 
limitations of fear and prejudice that have been thrust on him. For you in the 
West to hear the phrase 'All men are created equal' is to draw a yawn. For us 
it's a miracle. We're starting out at rock bottom, man. But South Africa does 
have soul." 
</P>
<P>
His thoughts returned to "My Children! My Africa!" 
</P>
<P>
"The things that converge in the writing of a play come from a complex of 
motives, a genesis shrouded in a certain kind of mystery," Fugard said. "I 
meditated on that teacher, and then the young people of South Africa. I had to 
acknowledge them and how extraordinary it is that they're fighting for a sense 
of decency under a system that's been imposed on them. The teacher gave me an 
opportunity to lay out my testament of faith in what I did as a man of the 
theater. 
</P>
<P>
"It gave me the opportunity to articulate my faith in the power of the spoken 
and written word. There are times in my 30 years in the theater that I have 
come perilously close to losing faith in the one form of action I have in this 
life. There have been moments when I've said, 'Put away the pens and paper and 
go learn to make bombs.' But I feel if I ever broke the silken thread of faith, 
I would not have gotten it back." 
</P>
<P>
To spend any time with Fugard is to become reacquainted with the temper of his 
plays, which echo in his personality. He has the storyteller's innate skill at 
creating intimacy with a subject through mood and evocative detail, and a born 
actor's emotional transparency as well; his mirth gusts through him, his griefs 
tie up his whippet-thin frame, and he moves visibly through the writer's 
classic unending struggle to harness a thought, nail down a phrase. 
</P>
<P>
He has a face that belongs more to the 19th Century than to the 20th. Its lean 
angularity tapers into a forward-thrusting beard that gives him the 
commemorative look of an explorer, a sea captain or a weathered field-commander 
-- a stern, dure visage staring obdurately into endless vistas of the unknown 
tinged with unimaginable hostility. His intense, recessed eyes are a dark agate 
color and seem to blacken as he recalls pain or grief. He's a good, eager 
listener and an easy laugher ("Chaplin had a motto, 'If the flesh does not 
laugh in mockery and delight at the world around it, and itself, the flesh will 
die.' "). 
</P>
<P>
Part of his interview took place in one of the playhouse offices and part on a 
trail of the Torrey Pines Reserve, which snaked along the top of a bluff 
overlooking the Pacific ("It's called the Fleming Loop," he later told 
Hilferty. "Sounds like a gynecological device, doesn't it?"). During the '60s 
he had written in his notebook, "How thin and insecure is that little beach of 
white sand we call consciousness. I've always known that in my writing it is 
the dark troubled sea of which I know nothing, save its presence, that carried 
me. I've always felt that creating was a fearless and a timid, a despairing and 
hopeful, launching out into that unknown." 
</P>
<P>
He peered down below. In bright sunlight, the ocean off La Jolla had a bit more 
of a tropical, aquamarine glow than the darker, blue-black color it has further 
north, and the mid-size waves rolled ashore in frolicsome crests. "I had a 
place on the beach in Port Elizabeth that had a view like this," he said. "Then 
I moved a couple of miles inland." Why? "Every time a black friend visited my 
house, a neighbor informed the police." 
</P>
<P>
In 1967, the South African government seized his passport and in effect 
sentenced him to an internal exile that lasted for four years. (His phone was 
tapped, his mail was opened, and he was subjected to frequent interrogations.) 
Not that he would've chosen to leave anyway. He was in England with his wife 
when he heard of the Sharpeville Massacre in 1960, in which 71 demonstrators 
among a group protesting South African pass laws were gunned down by police. 
His response was to return home at once. In a 1982 interview in the New Yorker, 
he explained his decision: "Like Tchaikovsky, I find that I cry very easily 
when I'm not on my native soil. I do very little crying back there. In Anna 
Akhmatova's awesome 'Requiem' she says, 'Under a foreign sky or on a strange 
land, I was with my people and they suffered.' That articulates it for me. It 
is an emotional bind to my country and its people that is without logic." He 
still lives in Port Elizabeth, but keeps a second home in Upstate New York. 
</P>
<P>
("You can always tell when he's been away from home for too long," observed 
Hilferty. "He begins drying up. You feel a melancholy in him.") 
</P>
<P>
Today he was peering out over the Pacific, but he was thinking of home, and the 
events he was observing from afar. "My plane had just touched down in 
Johannesburg when I heard of De Klerk's decision to release Nelson Mandela," he 
said. "Like any other South African I said, 'What's the catch?' But it became 
clear that Mandela was right when he said De Klerk was a sincere man. 
</P>
<P>
"They're not talking concessions now; they're talking about restructuring the 
society. The first meeting between the African National Congress and the 
government has taken place. The rabid response of the white fascist 
neo-conservatives is a sign of the government's effectiveness -- they're 
bombing the country the way the ANC used to do. What people don't realize is 
that Mandela has problems of his own with the militant young blacks. They want 
victory and subjugation of the whites, not a negotiated settlement. And I worry 
about Mandela's total allegiance to the ANC, which won't make peace with the 
Inkatha movement -- which is made up of the Zulu majority. 
</P>
<P>
"Still, how does a man like Mandela exist? After 27 years behind bars, the 
first words he utters are of forgiveness for those who took those years from 
his life. 'Come, join us,' he says. 'Let us make the future together.' " 
</P>
<P>
The subject brought him back to "My Children! My Africa!" "The single most 
awesome tragedy, the greatest social disaster in the history of South Africa, 
is the lack of education afforded blacks. We're not just talking about reading 
and writing, we're talking about the ability to get into other viewpoints and 
understand attitudes other than your own. Education is not just the development 
of social tools. The real arena of the challenge is in the realm of the soul. 
Even the ANC is pulling in its head at the sight of a generation that can't 
read or write. They're saying, 'For God's sake, don't boycott the schools! Get 
your education.' " 
</P>
<P>
Fugard sees a similar danger in America, a country for which he feels great 
affection but which alarms him. "It's even more dangerous in this society, 
because somehow the angers and frustrations built around the social inequities 
that exist here are much more poisonous than in South Africa. I've stood on a 
street in New York near Penn Station and listened to a black political group 
that sets up a soap box and harangues passersby, and I've heard more poison, 
more anger and evil from them than anything I've heard in South Africa. The 
castrating forms of censorship are all around in America. Look at the NEA 
dispute. America is engaged in economic censorship, of censoring itself 
beforehand. It's obvious that television has corrupted literary craft for the 
theater. Now the attention span is eight minutes, then a blackout for 
commercial. It plays to the lowest common denominator of human intelligence. 
The structuring of human experience, the understanding of emotion, is 
completely falsified. It's very depressing." 
</P>
<P>
Fugard later alluded to this mysterious groundswell of American rage when he 
spoke of casting "My Children! My Africa! in La Jolla. "The young people in my 
play deal with enormous anger and outrage," he said. "I wanted to be sure the 
actors I cast would understand that, so I asked all the actors who auditioned, 
young and old, about feeling anger. Some of the reponses -- particularly if you 
think all is well with your country -- would leave you frightened. You saw 
bitterness, frustration, anger of a most bitter degree, towards the business 
and society at large. I'm talking explosive responses." 
</P>
<P>
He spoke about the experience of Nancy Travis, who plays Isabel (Brock Peters 
plays Mr. M. and Sterling Macer plays Thami), and what she was up against as a 
woman. "I went to see the film she made, 'Internal Affairs.' She plays a 
married woman and there's a scene in a restaurant where her husband accuses her 
of having an affair with Richard Gere. She's innocent. The audience knows it, 
the husband doesn't. He slaps her around in public. The audience cheered. I 
couldn't believe it. It was horrible to sit in the middle of that savagery." 
</P>
<P>
Fugard was born Harold Athol Lannigan Fugard in Middleburg on June 11, 1932. 
His father was a jazz pianist who lost a leg in a childhood shipboard accident; 
lifelong complications forced an early retirement and a decline into alcoholism 
and inactivity. His mother was a matriarchal life force for the family (Fugard 
also has a brother and sister) and a good businesswoman. In 1941 she took over 
a Port Elizabeth cafe called the St. George's Park Tearoom, the setting of his 
"Master Harold . . . and the Boys." She doesn't appear in the play, but his 
shamed allusions to his father are echoed in his contention, "I have a 
deep-rooted sense of male ineffectuality." 
</P>
<P>
"I've never properly acknowledged my dad's influence on me," Fugard says now. 
"He was a great storyteller. One of my vivid memories is sitting at my father's 
bedside. The pain in what he called his 'gammy' leg was often unbearable. In 
return for my massaging it with the 1950s equivalent of Deep Heat called Oil of 
Wintergreen -- I can smell it now -- he told stories. We had a candle bedside 
so that we wouldn't disturb my mom. He loved Jack London, mystery thrillers, 
Bram Stoker, the Victorians. He'd put them in a nutshell and spin them out. I 
owe him the debt of my craft because I consider myself a storyteller." 
</P>
<P>
Of his mother, Fugard recalls, "A formidable lady. She paced me in my 
questioning, my examining and doubting the world in which I found myself. I'll 
never forget the way we did things together, the way she discovered her 
outrage, which didn't diminish but unfolded as she got older. She was a woman 
of righteous anger. Once when she was baking at the tea room, her bare arms 
covered with flour, she looked up and said, 'I shouldn't be making scones, I 
should be making bombs.' 
</P>
<P>
"She wasn't just formidable, she was big, big! It's no accident that the most 
affirmative influences in my life have been women. I think it's true anywhere, 
black and white women sustaining their men. It's deep, extraordinary, 
mysterious. Is there a bigger word than mother? Where do we have an expression 
that's as primitive, as archetypal, as that: passing on life that links one 
with all life. She had awe, a primitive capacity for wonder that turned on like 
a tap. She was a rainbow. She drew no distinctions between reality and her 
dream life -- Jung would've embraced her. Towards the end of her life, the 
dreams became powerfully religious. She told me once of witnessing the 
Crucifixion and hearing Christ groan as he pulled the cross up the hill. She 
couldn't stand it and picked up the long end to help. She described what it 
sounded like to hear the nails driven into his hands. 
</P>
<P>
"If you've inherited these qualities, you have a big debt of gratitude." 
</P>
<P>
Fugard took a scholarship at the Port Elizabeth Technical School to study auto 
mechanics (his mechanical skills have aided him enormously in the construction 
of his plays) and later took another scholarship at the University of Cape 
Town, where he studied philosophy and social anthropology, and spent his 
extracurricular time as an amateur boxer. In 1953, just before graduation, he 
decided to quit school. ("If I'd got that degree," he said in the New Yorker 
interview, "I could have been trapped into doing things I didn't want to do. I 
didn't want to teach. I just had a sense of horizons shrinking as I got nearer 
the end of university.") Instead, he hitchhiked the length of Africa with a 
friend and wound up broke in Port Sudan six months later, and from there signed 
on with a steamship bound for Japan. He was the only white man on board a ship 
full of Sudanese and Malaysians; it was his first experience in living with 
people of other races. 
</P>
<P>
"Those two years when I was a sailor were extraordinary," he said. "I realized 
just the other day how character-forming they were. Being a young white South 
African struggling with an accepted tradition of how to be with men of color, 
and how those traditions were wrong -- it was a muddle and a confusion. But in 
the end, how clarifying it was." 
</P>
<P>
Back home in Port Elizabeth, Fugard tried his hand at journalism, but found 
himself temperamentally unsuited to the dry conventions of reportage. He met 
and married another aspiring writer, Sheila Meiring. Both of them became 
interested in the theater (around this time, 1957, he wrote his first play, a 
short work called "The Cell," which premiered in a theater they founded in Cape 
Town). The Fugards relocated to Johannesburg, where Athol took a job as a clerk 
in a court that tried passbook cases. The job, which he described as "a 
nightmare," lasted only three months, but made a powerful impression on him 
when he saw how blacks brought in on charges of not carrying their government 
passes were completely deprived of due process (the experience later inspired 
one of his greatest successes, co-authored with John Kani and Winston Ntshona, 
"Sizwe Banzi Is Dead"). 
</P>
<P>
Fugard became a stage manager for South Africa's National Theatre Organization 
and began spending time in the black township of Sophiatown with black writers 
and others interested in starting a theater. He wrote "No-Good Friday" and 
"Klaas and the Devil," followed by "Nongogo," the story of an ex-prostitute who 
runs a saloon, and "A Place for the Pigs," which deals with a soldier who has 
been in hiding for 40 years. The works were performed for private audiences, 
but there wasn't much opportunity in South Africa at that time for playwrights 
with a new -- especially local -- voice. 
</P>
<P>
The Fugards moved to London to study theater; she worked as an office temp and 
he took up domestic housecleaning. (The Royal Court Theater not only wouldn't 
consider his plays, they wouldn't hire him as a stagehand either.) Fugard still 
views Great Britain with a certain misgiving, for political as well as personal 
reasons, though his plays are regularly performed there. ("My Children! My 
Africa!" opens at the National Theatre this fall, with his daughter, on whom he 
still dotes, calling her "my beautiful Lisa," appearing as Isabel.) 
</P>
<P>
"To this day, the British are rotten with class attitudes and prejudices," 
Fugard said. "It was they who first defined apartheid, but they don't 
acknowledge the significant hand they played in race relations in South 
Africa." 
</P>
<P>
Sheila Fugard's pregnancy with their daughter and news of the Sharpeville 
Massacre brought the Fugards back to South Africa. He wrote a novel called 
"Tsotsi," and then went to work on "The Blood Knot," in which he cast himself 
as the light-skinned Morris and Zakes Mokae as the darker-skinned Zach. He had 
been working with a young director named Barney Simon as well in a warehouse 
rehearsal space known as the Dorkay House. 
</P>
<P>
"Athol and I would stand at the window, watching the traffic come down the 
street," recalled Simon. "We'd wonder if any of the cars were going to stop at 
the theater." 
</P>
<P>
In a single October, 1961, performance before an steamy overcrowded house of 
friends, journalists and other theater professionals, the play ran uncut for 
four hours and revolutionized South African theater, much as John Osborne's 
"Look Back in Anger" had permanently altered the course of British theater -- 
South Africa had never seen a local interracial play like this before and had 
never heard the country's indigenous language expressed with such theatrical 
purity. 
</P>
<P>
"All my plays before that had been apprenticeship works," Fugard said. "I had 
set out to copy the masters, your Tennessee Williams, Arthur Miller, Clifford 
Odets and Eugene O'Neill. Not the British. The Americans seemed to have that 
raw, gutsy, emotionally charged quality I wanted to write about in my people. 
With 'Blood Knot,' I finally discovered my own voice, the language, structure 
and style that were uniquely mine." 
</P>
<P>
In 1963, a group of black men knocked on his door in Port Elizabeth. They were 
from a local township called New Brighton, and had heard of this fellow who had 
staged interracial plays. None of them had had any theater experience, but 
their collaboration with Fugard into a new troupe called the Serpent Theatre 
resulted in one of the most productive periods in Fugard's career (this was the 
period that produced "Sizwe Banzi Is Dead" and "The Island"). Other plays 
around this time, some with with the Serpent Theatre and some with his friend 
and associate, actress Yvonne Bryceland, included "The Cure" (1963), "People 
Are Living There" (1968), "Hello and Goodbye" (1969), "Friday's Bread on 
Monday"(1970), "Boesman and Lena" (1969), "Orestes"(1971) and "Dimetos"(1975). 
</P>
<P>
Some of the plays enjoyed a life outside South Africa and others didn't, but 
after "Sizwe Banzi" Fugard's work entered a more mature phase; everything he 
wrote met with international interest, including "Statements After an Arrest 
Under the Immorality Act" (1974), "A Lesson From Aloes" (1979), "Master Harold 
. . . and the Boys" (1982, his only play that did not premiere in South Africa) 
and "The Road to Mecca" (1984). 
</P>
<P>
"My Children! My Africa" opened at the Market Theater in Johannesburg in June 
of 1989 and had its American premiere at the New York Perry Street Theater in 
December. The La Jolla Playhouse production marks the West Coast debut of both 
the play and Fugard as director (he frequently acts in and directs his plays, 
and played Gen. Smuts in the film "Gandhi"). 
</P>
<P>
Fugard is a meticulous craftsman who writes the first draft of each play at 
home in Port Elizabeth with a different fountain pen and specially mixed ink. 
("To be a playwright is to be a maker of plays, like a wheelwright," he says. 
"You make a play like you make a table. You make it. It isn't just a matter of 
inspiration.") But inspiration does play its part. In addition to searching out 
what he calls his "fulcrum moments," those devices that quicken a play's hidden 
pulse, he usually puzzles one or more central, talismanic images. 
</P>
<P>
For "My Children! My Africa!," there's the image of a mountain pass. "I had Mr. 
M. holding a dictionary in one hand and a stone in the other to talk about how 
one had so much more power than the other -- the dictionary has 60,000 words, 
the stone just one -- but I didn't know where to go from there," Fugard said. 
"I knew I had to make Isabel go one step farther, but I didn't know what to do. 
I went for a run on one of the hottest days of the year in Port Elizabeth. 
After four miles, I suddenly -- it just came to me. I realized that Isabel had 
to pledge herself, to commit. I ran the next three miles crying tears of 
release -- I'd been so bottled up. There was a beat to the end -- Isabel at the 
mountain pass -- I didn't have to make up. It was already there. I sat down 
sweating and wrote it out." 
</P>
<P>
The allusion is to the boyhood of Mr. M., when en route to a rugby match, his 
class stops at the mountainous Wapadsberg Pass on the road to Cradock. The 
immense vista spread before him grips his heart. His asks his teacher what lies 
in that direction. North, is the answer, and if his little legs will carry him, 
he can wander the length of Africa and meet all his brothers. But if his little 
legs can't, he can meet them in books. So begins Mr. M.'s introduction to the 
power of the word. In the end, Isabel will seek out that pass. They are of 
different races, different generations, different sexes, and even a different 
consciousness, but standing on the same spot, they cannot help but share the 
same vision. 
</P>
<P>
"I'd been living in London and had seen the Bolshoi and Brecht and worked with 
Joan Littlewood," said Barney Simon, who in Johannesburg in 1976 co-founded the 
Market Theatre, which is now considered on a par with the Moscow Arts Theater, 
the Abbey and the Berliner Ensemble for the inspired concentration of its 
output. "Back in Johannesburg I saw one of Athol's early works, 'No-Good 
Friday,' and as amateurish as it was, it excited me as much as anything I'd 
seen. I felt an instant rapport and electricity with Athol. In his lyricism, he 
did for the South African language in the theater what Sean O'Casey did for the 
Irish. In a similar way he's a strong expression of the paradoxes and absurdity 
of existence -- all great theater is tragicomic. 
</P>
<P>
" 'My Children! My Africa!' is a very bold work for this time," Simon 
continued. "He argues that the word comes first, but I argue that his vision 
and impulse come first. His vision is extraordinary. And he's always had the 
courage to inform what he does with his own pain and damage. I'm not talking 
about personal confession. I mean really the true source, arrived at the 
hardest way, alone in front of a blank page." 
</P>
<P>
For a while before the conversation with Simon, the phone line to his 
Johannesburg apartment was down and it didn't look like an interview would be 
possible. A return to Fugard's notebooks seemed in order during the wait, and 
this passage seemed as characteristic as any: 
</P>
<P>
"People must be loved. That is the really crucifying experience in the short 
time we have as human beings -- that intimacy which breaks through our 
defensive isolation and shows the capacity -- if need be no more than that -- 
just the awareness of a potential -- of someone else's suffering." 
</P>
