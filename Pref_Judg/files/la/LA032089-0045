William J. Bennett, head of the Administration's war on drugs, said Sunday he 
believes it is time for the federal government to go after "recreational, 
yuppie" drug users, saying they share responsibility for "the murder and mayhem 
in Washington, the fact that we have babies now being born addicted to cocaine" 
and the killings of Drug Enforcement Administration agents in other countries. 
</P>
<P>
"These people are accessories to all those things, and they need to start 
paying a price for that," Bennett said in an appearance on NBC's "Meet the 
Press." 
</P>
<P>
Bennett, estimating that 70% of the cocaine used in this country is consumed by 
recreational users, dismissed the idea of enacting tough, mandatory prison 
sentences for these individuals, saying: "It's easy to say, but where are you 
going to put people?" 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Would Put Picture in Paper 
</P>
<P>
Instead, he said: "There are other things you can do. Suggestions that have 
been made to me are: Let's put their picture in the newspaper. Let's have a 
mandatory fine -- $5,000 to $10,000. If you're using cocaine and driving around 
in your BMW, when you get stopped, you lose your BMW." 
</P>
<P>
Bennett has moved swiftly to establish his drug war agenda, beginning last week 
with his effort to persuade President Bush to reverse his earlier opposition to 
curbing the spread of assault weapons. The Bush Administration acted quickly 
and imposed an immediate temporary ban on the importation of more than 110,000 
AK-47s, Uzi carbines and other semiautomatic weapons until the government 
decides whether they are suitable for "sporting purposes." 
</P>
<P>
It appeared Sunday, however, that there are differing views among federal 
officials involved in the drug war over how far the Administration should move 
on gun control. 
</P>
<P>
Atty. Gen. Dick Thornburgh, appearing on ABC's "This Week With David Brinkley," 
seemed to be at odds with Bennett, insisting that "there is a historic and 
honorable firearms tradition in this country . . . recognized in the 
Constitution." Careful study should precede action, he said, warning that "you 
can't pass a law and think you're going to solve the problem." 
</P>
<P>
But DEA chief John C. Lawn, speaking on CBS' "Face the Nation," seemed to 
indicate that he would go far beyond Bennett, preferring a complete ban on all 
semiautomatic weapons, including those manufactured in the United States. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Downplays Legal Solutions 
</P>
<P>
Thornburgh predicted that the war on drugs will be won "on the battlefield of 
values" rather than through increased law enforcement or hotly debated controls 
on assault weapons. 
</P>
<P>
"These battles aren't going to be won in the courtroom, they're going to be won 
in the classroom and the community, in the family and every institution that we 
have in our society that's going to face up to the problem of drugs and deal 
with it squarely and directly," Thornburgh said. 
</P>
<P>
When asked by CBS correspondent Lesley Stahl whether she was correct in 
assuming that he wanted semiautomatics "to be banned across-the-board -- 
manufacture, sales, imports, everything," Lawn replied: "You are." 
</P>
<P>
Further, Lawn said: "The real crux of the problem about violence in our 
society, about drug abuse in our society, is that there really is no penalty. 
Individuals can be arrested, law enforcement personnel can get out and do their 
job, but because there are no prisons, there is no real fear of incarceration 
among the criminal element." 
</P>
<P>
Bennett did not elaborate on what the Bush Administration will recommend in the 
way of going after drug users, although he said "we'll propose something, 
obviously." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
'Lot of Ideas Out There' 
</P>
<P>
He added: "We're going to look at all the options. I've got a lot of consulting 
to do. Right now, I'm having a series of meetings with the people out there in 
the country who are expert on this -- meeting with eight or 10 people a day -- 
it's been three or four times a week, anyway -- getting their advice from the 
law enforcement side and the treatment side. I'm talking to the Hill. There are 
a lot of ideas out there." 
</P>
<P>
Washington Mayor Marion Barry, who has denied public allegations that he is a 
cocaine user, criticized the characterization of Washington as the "murder 
capital of the country" for its record high drug-related slayings, and 
suggested that it was the federal government's responsibility to wipe out the 
drug business by sending the military to Latin America. 
</P>
<P>
"The national government needs to go to these five or six countries in South 
and Central America, send the Army, the Navy, the Air Force, the Marines and 
the Coast Guard," he said on the ABC program. "Burn up those fields, eradicate 
those coca leaves, blow up those labs -- stop it at the source."
