Tempers were hot and separate sets of roadblocks kept outsiders away from the 
St. Regis Indian Reservation in Upstate New York, where federal and state 
authorities had raided four gambling casinos earlier last week. About 50 state 
troopers sealed the area around the reservation, which straddles the Canadian 
border near Hogansburg, and Mohawk Indians closed the roads within the 
14,460-acre territory for a third day. "We're detouring traffic around the 
reservation because they've shut down the roads inside," said State Police Sgt. 
Michael Downs. Tribal chiefs, who have written to Gov. Mario M. Cuomo calling 
the dawn raid Thursday an "act of war," meanwhile agreed to hold a referendum 
this week on whether the reservation should continue to sponsor gambling 
activities.
