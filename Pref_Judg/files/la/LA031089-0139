A series of killings of cats and other small pets in sections of North Tustin 
and nearby communities has alarmed pet owners and sparked an investigation by 
county animal control officials. 
</P>
<P>
The officials have all but concluded that the killings were done by coyotes 
searching for food, but some of the residents are not buying that explanation. 
</P>
<P>
If coyotes are killing the pets, one of the residents said this week, then they 
are coyotes that carry Swiss Army knives. 
</P>
<P>
Janet Hampson, who lives on Malena Street in North Tustin, says she has 
documented the killing of nearly 50 cats and other animals since last May by 
human hands -- by someone with a knife who is cutting up the animal body parts 
and collecting the blood, perhaps to use in some kind of satanic ritual. 
</P>
<P>
Hampson has embarked on a one-woman campaign to alert pet owners to what she 
fears is a danger more sinister than hungry coyotes. 
</P>
<P>
"The only people who think we're dealing with coyotes are the authorities," 
said Hampson, a part-time political consultant and owner of three cats. She 
plans to plaster the area with fliers that describe the deaths and urge people 
to keep their pets indoors. 
</P>
<P>
Hampson is backed in her effort by the owners of the dead animals, many of whom 
said they found their pets cut in two or more pieces with what appeared to be a 
sharp knife or surgical tool. In nearly every case, the pet owners said, there 
was little or no blood in, on or around the animal's carcass. 
</P>
<P>
Hampson has collected information on 43 cases, some of which involved more than 
one animal, from parts of North Tustin, Tustin, Orange and Villa Park. She said 
the reports include instances where intestines, severed paws and internal 
organs appeared to have been washed and neatly arranged around the body. In 
other cases, body parts and organs were missing. 
</P>
<P>
The lack of blood has led Hampson and some of the pet owners to wonder if some 
sort of cult is involved. Hampson has been looking for clues in literature on 
satanism. 
</P>
<P>
Police and animal control officials concede that "isolated" instances of 
satanic activity may be occurring in the county, but they said they doubt that 
the animals Hampson has cited were killed for rituals. 
</P>
<P>
Jack Edwards, chief of field services for the county's Animal Control Division, 
said he has seen the materials gathered by Hampson and has not changed his 
opinion that the pets were killed either by coyotes or dogs or while they were 
sleeping on the engine of a car to keep warm. 
</P>
<P>
"I've had to cut many a cat out of a fan belt or an engine," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Three reports of mutilated cats that animal control officers responded to this 
week turned out to be coyote kills, he added. 
</P>
<P>
Although the vast majority of the dead animals have been cats, a few reports 
have involved rabbits, ducks, gerbils, birds and opossums. 
</P>
<P>
"I've never seen anything like this," said Dr. James Connoyer, a North Tustin 
veterinarian whose cat, Keoke, was found last May on a neighbor's lawn cut 
horizontally in perfect halves. 
</P>
<P>
Connoyer, who worked for 4 years as an emergency veterinarian at the Orange 
County Emergency Pet Clinic in Garden Grove and who has seen the carcasses of 
two cats besides his own, said he is familiar with how a pet that has been 
mauled by a wild animal looks. 
</P>
<P>
"It was hard for me to imagine that these were typical of attacks by dogs or 
coyotes," he said. "Organs were missing. The animals were severed in half very 
cleanly. There were no bite wounds anywhere." 
</P>
<P>
Keith Hayes of Orange and his wife, Terri, said that last September they found 
the head of their cat on their lawn facing toward the east with two of its paws 
lined up neatly in front. 
</P>
<P>
"I don't feel safe. I haven't for a long time," said Terri Hayes. "I'm afraid 
to let my daughter play outside. 
</P>
<P>
Accompanied by a reporter and a photographer, Hampson this week examined 
drainage ditches in Tustin, Orange and North Tustin, looking for signs of 
satanic activity. The ditches were mentioned as places where cats were killed 
in an article last month in the Tustin News. 
</P>
<P>
Of five ditches examined, three contained graffiti that were later identified 
as associated with Satanism. The outside of a storm drain pipe in Tustin near 
Walnut Avenue and Cherrywood Lane was covered with such graffiti. The words 
"Satanic Rules" were scrawled in grease pencil on the ceiling of the pipe, 
which is large enough for an adult to walk inside. 
</P>
<P>
Satanism was not ruled out by Mike Burns, an animal control administrator for 
the city of Los Angeles who is familiar with the use of animals in sacrifices 
and other rituals. 
</P>
<P>
Burns, who this week presented the Los Angeles Board of Animal Regulation with 
a voluminous report on the subject, said that animal blood, organs and body 
parts are a major part of satanic rituals. 
</P>
<P>
Burns reviewed the material collected by Hampson and concluded that satanists 
or someone trying to emulate them could be involved. He based his conclusion, 
he stressed, solely on descriptions of the carcasses provided to Hampson by the 
owners of the pets. He noted that some of the killings occurred on or around 
satanic holidays, such as St. Winebald's Day, which is Jan. 7. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Wild Animal Killings 
</P>
<P>
"Assuming that the descriptions are accurate, I would say you're not dealing 
with wild animals," he said. "I've never seen a coyote string intestines in a 
line alongside a body. 
</P>
<P>
"A coyote will usually eat the entrails first and will eat the liver and heart, 
but when you're talking about a cat cut in half or with its chest cut open and 
two front paws missing -- no, you're not talking coyote." 
</P>
<P>
But an animal control officer who was spotted looking for coyote tracks at a 
drainage ditch in North Tustin, said he is convinced that a coyote can bite a 
cat in half without spraying blood all around. 
</P>
<P>
"I've seen many of these cases," he said, "and they always turn out to be cat 
versus coyote."
