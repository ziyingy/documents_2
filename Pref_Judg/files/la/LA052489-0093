A Soviet search ship photographed the hulk of a nuclear-powered submarine that 
sank off Norway on April 7 with the loss of 42 crew members and found no 
increase in radiation in the area, the Tass news agency said. The Soviet 
research ship Akademik Mstislav Keldysh arrived May 16 in the waters where the 
sub -- armed with nuclear-tipped torpedoes -- sank. It visually detected the 
wreck with the help of deep-sea exploration vehicles it carries and 
photographed it, Tass said.
