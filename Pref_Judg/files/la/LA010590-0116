American, a subsidiary of Ft. Worth-based AMR Corp., said it will match 
Eastern's fares wherever it competes with the Miami-based carrier. "We are 
matching in markets where we compete. It affects about 600 markets," a 
spokeswoman for American said. Eastern, a unit of Texas Air Corp., unveiled 
fares up to 45% below industry levels earlier this week.
