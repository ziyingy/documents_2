New Year's Eve in San Diego County: 
</P>
<P>
One man was shot 3 hours before the old year ended; he died hours into the new 
year. 
</P>
<P>
A driver was jailed after his brother died in what police described as a crash 
fueled by alcohol. 
</P>
<P>
A quadriplegic was briefly kidnaped in a car by two armed men, and then dumped 
alongside a dark highway. 
</P>
<P>
And a teen-ager, apparently caught up in the noise-and-fireworks revelry of New 
Year's Eve, fired several shots into the air from a pistol. Then he 
accidentally fired a fatal shot at his head. 
</P>
<P>
"This New Year's Eve was a very busy night for us," Lt. Michael Blakely, a San 
Diego police spokesman, said Sunday afternoon as he sorted through a log of 
crime incident reports. 
</P>
<P>
At the same time, without releasing any hard figures on the number of arrests, 
law enforcement agencies throughout the county said it appeared that the number 
of New Year's Eve drunk-driving cases had declined.
