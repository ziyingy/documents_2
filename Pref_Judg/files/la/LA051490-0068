Cockroaches, beetles, dogs and humans all employ the same gait when running, 
researchers at UC Berkeley revealed last week. Insects employ a running gait 
and not a walking gait, they have found, while crabs actually gallop.

Biologist Robert Full discovered these facts while testing the various species 
on treadmills enclosed in airtight plastic boxes that allow measurement of even 
the minuscule amount of oxygen consumed by the smaller species. The results may 
have application in robotic design.

The main thing Fuller has found, he said, is that the energy required in 
getting from one place to another is not greatly affected by how many legs an 
animal has or even by the way it moves. The energy required to walk or run 
depends much more heavily on the amount of force needed simply to hold the body 
up against gravity than on the mechanical power needed to swing the legs and 
propel the body forward.

Rather than smoothness of gait or even the number of legs an animal has, the 
key to economy of movement, Fuller has found, lies in the time it takes each 
leg to go through its whole cycle of movement and the force produced by the leg 
muscles.
