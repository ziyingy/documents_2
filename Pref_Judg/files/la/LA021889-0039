A power struggle virtually paralyzed the nation's largest Indian tribe Friday 
as Navajo Chairman Peter MacDonald tried in vain to reclaim office just 16 
hours after stepping aside to fight allegations of corruption and fraud. 
</P>
<P>
The bizarre turn of events at one point left the 200,000-member tribe with 
three chairmen, two vice chairmen and an apparently hamstrung governing body. 
</P>
<P>
"We are not a banana republic," delegate Anderson Tully declared as the 
88-member Tribal Council debated the confusing situation. 
</P>
<P>

<P>
Retains Salary 
</P>
<P>
Declaring tribal government in a "state of emergency," the council announced 
that it had voted 49 to 14 with five abstentions late Friday to suspend 
MacDonald indefinitely while continuing to pay his $55,000 annual salary. The 
council did not account for the other 20 members. 
</P>
<P>
The historic action came just hours after the 60-year-old leader attempted to 
rescind the voluntary paid leave he had taken the night before. 
</P>
<P>
Spokesmen said MacDonald sought to return because the council had rebuffed his 
bid to name his own successor and have the tribe provide legal expenses, office 
space and a support staff while he tries to clear his name. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Operating in Limbo 
</P>
<P>
The council operated in legal limbo Friday, with no definitive opinion on who 
exactly had the authority to run the tribe -- MacDonald, his vice chairman, 
Johnny Thompson, or the chairman pro tempore named by the council, Marshall 
Plummer. 
</P>
<P>
The council recessed until Tuesday without addressing the issue. 
</P>
<P>
Before heading home to explain the perplexing situtation to their constituents 
this weekend, the council decided to appoint an independent prosecutor to look 
into the allegations against MacDonald. 
</P>
<P>
Several councilmen described the move as an attempt to "clear the name of our 
chairman and the Navajo tribe." 
</P>
<P>
U.S. Senate hearings this month into allegations of fraud and mismanagement in 
Indian country produced damaging testimony against MacDonald -- some of it by 
his own son. 
</P>
<P>
MacDonald is accused of taking kickbacks and soliciting favors from contractors 
seeking to do business with the reservation. He also has been accused of 
profiting from a huge land sale to the tribe. 
</P>
<P>
MacDonald has denied any wrongdoing, and no formal charges have been filed. A 
federal grand jury in Phoenix is looking into the case and has subpoenaed 
financial documents from the tribe. 
</P>
<P>
Despite the council suspension, spokeswoman Tazbah McCullah said MacDonald 
still considers himself chairman. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Conflicting Opinions 
</P>
<P>
She said the tribe's Justice Department had conflicting opinions about the 
legality of the council maneuver. 
</P>
<P>
MacDonald did not attend the session and issued no immediate statement. 
</P>
<P>
"MacDonald is a very desperate man," said Stan Milford, his former campaign 
manager. "He's going to be indicted within a month. He's stalling for time. 
</P>
<P>
"He portrays himself to the public as a Geronimo," Milford said. "We say 
Geronimo was an honorable man who did not steal from his people. 
</P>
<P>
"We more or less place MacDonald with Noriega, Marcos, Kadafi and the shah." 
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the leader of a campaign to recall MacDonald filed a $2.4-million 
libel suit against MacDonald and key aides in connection with an anonymous 
smear sheet circulated here, the tribe's capital. 
</P>
<P>
Without offering substantiation or attribution, the crude leaflet accused 
several MacDonald foes of unsavory behavior. The libel suit was filed by recall 
leader John Chapela, an attorney. 
</P>
<P>
McCullah denied allegations that the three-page smear sheet either originated 
from the chairman's offices or was duplicated there. She said she had "no idea" 
where they came from.
