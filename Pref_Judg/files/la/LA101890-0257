torrential rains hit southern France, authorities said today.

About six inches of rain fell in less than an hour Wednesday night in parts of 
the Var region near Toulon, and another four inches fell in the 
Alpes-Maritimes.

The downpour quickly overflowed stream beds hardened by a long drought and 
spilled onto highways and into homes.
