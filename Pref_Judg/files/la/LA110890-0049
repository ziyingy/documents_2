A Newhall woman who had numerous drunk-driving arrests was found guilty 
Wednesday of vehicular manslaughter for driving drunk and causing a crash that 
killed a Canadian motorcyclist and injured his wife of one month. 
</P>
<P>
But jurors acquitted Patricia Lee Giunta, 41, of gross vehicular manslaughter, 
a more serious charge for which she could have faced a maximum prison sentence 
of 10 years and eight months when combined with other charges. Instead, Giunta 
faces a maximum sentence of six years and eight months in prison when she is 
sentenced Dec. 13 in San Fernando Superior Court.

Deputy Dist. Atty. Jacquelyn Lacey, who prosecuted Giunta, said she had mixed 
feelings about the verdict but said she is glad that Giunta will spend time in 
jail for the crash.

The Oct. 4, 1989, crash on the Golden State Freeway in Sun Valley left David 
Jaggs, 24, dead and his wife, Janine, 21, seriously injured. The couple had 
recently moved to Los Angeles to attend college, Lacey said. 
</P>
<P>
Blood tests taken after the crash showed that Giunta had a 0.29% blood-alcohol 
level. 
</P>
<P>
Giunta testified that she had consumed nearly a pint of vodka before the crash, 
but said she did not feel intoxicated when she entered the Tuxford Street 
on-ramp to the freeway and struck the motorcycle. She said the motorcycle cut 
her off, but Janine Jaggs testified that the motorcycle did not change lanes. 
</P>
<P>
Lacey said that Giunta had been arrested four times for drunk driving before 
last fall's crash and was arrested again for drunk driving while out on bail in 
the case. But she was convicted only once, in large part because she had 
claimed that police had lied in the other cases, Lacey said. 
</P>
<P>
"You can only claim the cops lie so many times, and then you have to look at 
yourself," Lacey told jurors after the verdict was read. "To get arrested only 
30 days after" the fatal crash "made me angry at this woman." 
</P>
<P>
Jurors said they had difficulty understanding the meaning of gross vehicular 
manslaughter. To be convicted of the charge, a defendant must exhibit wanton 
disregard for human life.
