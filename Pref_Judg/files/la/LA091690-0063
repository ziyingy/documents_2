In an era of dying small towns, Ohio paid a price to survive. The gritty 
community of 540 offered cash incentives of up to $5,000 to lure newcomers 
willing to trade big-city amenities for small-town charm. 
</P>
<P>
The results surprised everyone. 
</P>
<P>
Today, vacant homes are virtually non-existent. Most houses boast fresh paint, 
neatly mowed lawns and gardens sprouting flowers and vegetables. There is a new 
subdivision with sewers, water and electrical lines, and construction is under 
way on new houses. 
</P>
<P>
City leaders also hope to land a federally subsidized housing project for older 
residents to free up even more houses for prospective buyers. 
</P>
<P>
"The bounty (money) gets people's attention. But it's not the key to getting 
them here," says Jack Piper, one of the program's architects. "Visitors just 
get such a warm feeling about the community. They see why it's such a great 
place to live." 
</P>
<P>
Two years ago, Ohio had little to offer. "We were suffering because our kids 
were moving out, our population was aging and we didn't have any new jobs," 
Piper says. 
</P>
<P>
Dick Swanson helped organize a town meeting at which "we passed the hat and a 
couple dozen people chipped in." The group formed the Ohio Growth Foundation to 
make one last attempt to generate some expansion. 
</P>
<P>
In early 1989, the foundation launched a modest marketing campaign stressing 
friendly community life, top-notch schools and a crime-free environment, with 
the cash incentive as the centerpiece. 
</P>
<P>
The foundation offers grants of $3,000 to anyone buying an existing house or 
$5,000 to buyers of newly built houses. The grants are to pay real estate 
taxes. 
</P>
<P>
"The response was much greater than we anticipated. We weren't ready for the 
calls we got," Swanson said. 
</P>
<P>
Ohio resembles dozens of remote towns sprinkled among the cornfields of rural 
Illinois. Its classic business district includes a post office, bank, feed 
store, beauty parlor, insurance agent's office, attorney's office, gas station, 
coffee shop and a couple of taverns. 
</P>
<P>
Downtown is bisected by an abandoned railroad right-of-way. The tracks are long 
gone, a sign that often signals the demise of farming communities that had 
developed as rail stops where farmers shipped crops, bought seed, supplies and 
groceries and met friends. 
</P>
<P>
What the railroad left behind in Ohio is Swanson's huge grain elevator. He now 
ships grain by truck rather than boxcar. 
</P>
<P>
The hog sale barn is closed. But Bill Sisler's ice business thrives, along with 
his dairy that produces rich ice cream in flavors such as tin roof sundae. 
</P>
<P>
The loss of rail service left Ohio with intersecting two-lane blacktops as the 
only link to Chicago, 105 miles east, and Peoria, 75 miles south. 
</P>
<P>
Overcoming the remote location wasn't the only obstacle to growth. 
</P>
<P>
The transfusion generated by the cash incentive program had to wait for major 
surgery on the town's heart: its classic old brick school, where grades 
kindergarten through 12 study under one roof in classrooms overlooking a tiny 
gymnasium and stage. 
</P>
<P>
As the town's population dropped over the years, enrollment at school dwindled, 
making it harder to find teachers and administrators. 
</P>
<P>
Two years ago, only 40 children remained in high school and a budget deficit 
loomed. Demographic trends pointed to an aging population and a declining 
birthrate. 
</P>
<P>
Rather than close the school and consolidate with another withering town, 
residents approved a 40% tax increase. 
</P>
<P>
"I guess we're crazy, but we think our kids are worth it," Piper said. "It 
costs a lot to run our school. But we figure, if we spend money on schools and 
send them to college, maybe we won't have to spend a lot of money on jails." 
</P>
<P>
But money alone didn't solve the problem. A catalyst was needed to re-energize 
teachers and students alike, and integrate new ideas without disrupting the 
community's comfortable family environment. 
</P>
<P>
Frank Dagne was coaxed out of retirement from nearby Sterling-Rock Falls where 
he served as school superintendent and school board member. He agreed to help 
Ohio find a permanent administrator. 
</P>
<P>
Four years later, he is still on the job and has relocated to Ohio. Dagne has 
caught Ohio fever and he's glad he did. 
</P>
<P>
One of his first moves was to hold private fund-raisers to buy a dozen 
computers for the school. In two years, he raised $8,000 from Ohio residents, 
many of whom don't have children in school. 
</P>
<P>
Next, he renovated a study hall into a library resource center. He also hired a 
retired band director to help build school spirit. 
</P>
<P>
"We were down to eight students, most of whom couldn't read music," Dagne said. 
"I hired a retired band director, Dick Davis, and now we have 40 kids in band. 
They sound great and they are winning awards. And the community really supports 
it. 
</P>
<P>
"It's an example of the difference in the communal feeling of this town. People 
here really are friendlier and concerned about the kids. They really care." 
</P>

Tony DiCarro saw a news report about what Ohio calls a bounty while 
rehabilitating a house in Florida. "I was looking for the peace and quiet of a 
small town," said DiCarro, who has relocated to Ohio and is gutting an old 
apartment house. 
</P>
<P>
The cash incentive program has resulted in sales of 24 homes -- leaving just 
one vacant house in town.
