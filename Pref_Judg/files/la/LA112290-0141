Still without a new home, a San Pedro ministry for the homeless will close its 
doors Dec. 1 because its building has been judged seismically unsafe by 
building inspectors. 
</P>
<P>
The closing of The Crossing at 7th and Centre streets follows years of warnings 
by the city of Los Angeles that the ministry's brick building, built in 1923, 
must be repaired or vacated.

<P>
The owner, Mercy Ships Ministries, a Texas-based Christian foundation, faces 
criminal prosecution if the building is not boarded up by the first week of 
December.

Harlan Heyer, The Crossing's executive director, said Tuesday that the ministry 
hopes to have a new location rented by a week from Saturday. "We're looking at 
several locations and hopefully we can find a place that we can afford," Heyer 
said. The group has provided hot meals at its downtown San Pedro center since 
1986. 
</P>
<P>
The Crossing's search for a new location, Heyer said, has been assisted by a 
San Pedro couple who donated $5,000 to the ministry after learning of its need 
to relocate.
