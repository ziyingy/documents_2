The following is a letter from a 32-year-old high-school teacher: 
</P>
<P>
"After four years I have finally ended (I hope) a very destructive relationship 
with my boyfriend. I knew Rod was bad for me -- he was untrustworthy, critical, 
mean and verbally abusive, but I couldn't get myself to leave him. I felt 
intensely in love with him, and when I would try to break it off, I would be 
miserable, panicky and would get physically sick. Despite resolving never to 
see him again, in a few days or weeks I'd call him. 
</P>
<P>
"What finally made me end it was watching Hedda Nussbaum describe the awful 
treatment she received from Joel Steinberg. Every time this horribly battered 
woman was asked why she stayed with him, she said that it was because she loved 
him. Rod never physically struck me, but the battering with words and the bad 
treatment that I suffered were too humiliating to write about. When I realized 
that I was just like Hedda, I thought: 'This is it. If I don't end it now, I am 
going down the drain.' 
</P>
<P>
"Despite all that, it's been hard to keep from calling him. I am terrified that 
I will weaken and that I will allow the whole cycle of abuse to start all over 
again. Is there something that I can tell myself that will make this period any 
easier?" 
</P>

The first thing that you need to realize is that you -- like many other men and 
women in similar situations -- are suffering from an addiction to this person. 
I mean that literally -- like an addiction to nicotine, alcohol or any other 
drug. Your addiction is rooted in feelings of insecurity, emptiness or 
inadequacy; and the belief that your connection to Rod is the only remedy for 
those feelings. He is your fix. Just as surely as a coke addict feels the need 
for cocaine, you feel the need for Rod. You are now going through withdrawal 
symptoms that can be as painful and debilitating as withdrawal from a 
substance. You have the same desire to reconnect as any addict has. 
</P>
<P>
In my book "How to Break Your Addiction to a Person" (Bantam: 1983) I call this 
powerful need to connect and remain connected "Attachment Hunger." It is a need 
that we all have as babies and that remains with us to some degree ever after. 
When our Attachment Hunger for a person is so strong that it overrides our 
judgment about what's in our own best interest, we become addicted. That's what 
happened with you and Rod -- your Attachment Hunger kept you there despite your 
knowledge that the relationship was harmful to you. Instead of feeling that 
without Rod you're a lost nobody, you have to begin to strengthen and expand 
your sense of your own growth and completeness as an individual. 
</P>
<P>
You ask what you can tell yourself to make this withdrawal period easier. In 
"How to Break Your Addiction to a Person" I list 25 "Addiction-Breaking 
Aphorisms." Here are a few of them: 
</P>
<P>
 -- You can live without this person (probably better). 
</P>
<P>
 -- Love is not enough (to make a good love relationship). 
</P>
<P>
 -- The intensity of your withdrawal symptoms does not indicate the strength of 
your love but the strength of your addiction. 
</P>
<P>
 -- You are a whole and valuable person apart from the relationship. 
</P>
<P>
 -- When you feel inadequate, incomplete or worthless apart from this person, 
it is a sign that childhood feelings are taking over. 
</P>
<P>
 -- This person is not the "one and only." 
</P>
<P>
 -- The pain of ending it won't last nearly as long as the pain of not ending 
it. 
</P>
<P>
 -- If you end this bad relationship, you will be opening your life to new 
possibilities. 
</P>
<P>
There are several other things that you can do to get through this difficult 
period: 
</P>
<P>
 -- Write down all of the reasons that you decided to end the relationship, 
including as many instances as you can remember that made you feel demeaned, 
furious or depressed. During withdrawal it is easy to get what I call 
"Addiction Amnesia," a sort of nostalgia in which you forget all the bad and 
remember only the good. So whenever you feel the urge to get in touch with him, 
look at your record of unhappy events to remind yourself of why you ended the 
relationship. 
</P>
<P>
 -- Tell a friend or friends who you can count on for support that you are 
trying to break your addiction to Rod, and ask them to help you if you call. 
Then, when you are tempted to call Rod, call your friends instead and let them 
tell you why you shouldn't. 
</P>
<P>
 -- Get involved in activities that you enjoy. Do things that make you feel 
good about yourself and that you may have put off or suspended because you were 
so involved with Rod. Rediscover that the world is bigger than just your narrow 
preoccupation with this one person.
