Jews needing to arbitrate business and personal disputes are increasingly 
turning to an ancient legal system, whose proceedings are substantially 
cheaper, quicker and more private than civil court. 
</P>
<P>
There has been a "tremendous explosion of interest" recently in arbitrations 
according to Jewish law, says Rabbi Avrohom Teichman, who directs a Los Angeles 
bet din (house of law). 
</P>
<P>
Teichman said his bet din is handling cases such as a property settlement in a 
divorce, a claim against a Jewish religious school by a teacher whose contract 
was not renewed, a dispute between a contractor and a homeowner complaining of 
substandard repair work, a disagreement between two organizations over a debt 
and accusations of slander resulting in the alleged loss of business by a 
high-tech company. 
</P>
<P>
A recent case involved an Orthodox Jew from West Los Angeles who lent his van 
to an acquaintance. Though they talked beforehand about what would happen in 
case of an accident, they misunderstood each other. And when the borrower 
crashed the vehicle, they argued over who should pay for what. 
</P>
<P>
To avoid a lengthy and expensive civil lawsuit and the breakup of their 
friendship, they agreed to have the dispute adjudicated by a bet din. At the 
Los Angeles Kollel, an institute for advanced Jewish learning in the Fairfax 
district, a rabbi appointed a panel of three judges. As is typical in bet din 
cases, the two men signed a contract, enforceable in civil court, obligating 
them to abide by the decision. 
</P>
<P>
After hearing evidence, the bet din assigned two-thirds of the repair costs to 
the man who borrowed the van. The progress was free and took only a few hours, 
and the two men have remained friends. 
</P>
<P>
Teichman plans to publish a pamphlet explaining the process. "People are afraid 
to come to a bet din because they don't know the procedure," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Although most Jewish courts exist within the Orthodox community, where 
adherence to traditional law is strictest, even many non-Orthodox Jews are 
using the system to arrange matters of personal status, such as conversions and 
divorces. 
</P>
<P>
They may do so out of respect for Jewish tradition or to avoid future problems 
for themselves or their children. They may also want to protect their 
immigration and marriage rights in Israel, where all matters of personal status 
are regulated by the Orthodox rabbinate, which does not accept conversions or 
divorces implemented by non-Orthodox authorities. 
</P>
<P>
Conservative Judaism, which is less strict in it adherence to traditional 
Jewish law, has a single bet din in Los Angeles, located at the University of 
Judaism. It primarily handles conversions and divorces, according to Rabbi Ben 
Zion Bergman, its director. Reform Judaism has eliminated the institution of 
the bet din altogether. "We do not function as if bound by Halacha (Jewish 
law), so it would be inappropriate for us to set up a bet din," explained Rabbi 
Leonard Thal, director of the local region of the Union of American Hebrew 
Congregations, the Reform umbrella group. 
</P>
<P>
Members of other religions, including Roman Catholics, Mormons and 
Presbyterians, also have court systems but they generally only adjudicate 
ecclesiastical matters and issues of personal status. Among Muslims, 
traditional Islamic law, called the sharia, is also used to adjudicate business 
and personal matters. In Los Angeles, according to spokesman Maher Hathout, the 
Islamic Center of Southern California has only "unofficial" arbitration 
services, in which a single arbitrator will attempt to resolve issues. 
</P>
<P>
Many cities with large Orthodox Jewish populations have a sitting bet din. 
</P>
<P>
But there is no such arrangement in Southern California. In the extremely 
decentralized Orthodox community, the closest thing to an official bet din is 
operated by the Rabbinical Council of California, directed by Rabbi Shmuel 
Katz, a world-acknowledged Jewish legal expert. Katz's bet din handles 
virtually all the Orthodox conversions in Los Angeles and probably more than 
half of the 50 or so Jewish divorces settled here each month. 
</P>
<P>
Jewish law does not always work, however, as smoothly as it did in the case of 
the wrecked van. One inherent weakness of the bet din is that it lacks the 
power to enforce its decisions. 
</P>
<P>
Last March, for example, a conflict erupted between Chabad, the Hasidic group, 
and the Westwood Bayit, a cooperative Jewish student house near the UCLA 
campus. Both organizations claimed ownership of the Bayit building on 
fraternity row and other properties worth a total of $1.5 million. 
</P>
<P>
When Chabad, holding an apparently valid deed, took over the Westwood building 
and converted it into a shelter for temporarily homeless men, Bayit supporters 
claimed that the deed had been obtained fraudulently. 
</P>
<P>
The Bayit lodged a formal complaint with Teichman, whose bet din issued a 
"summons" to Chabad. Instead of having Teichman appoint the judges on the bet 
din, the two organizations agreed on a procedure in which each appointed one 
judge. The two judges then were to pick a third, neutral judge. 
</P>
<P>
The process stalled, however, when Chabad challenged the Bayit's choice for a 
judge. The Bayit has reopened its case in civil court, which it had dropped in 
order to speed the bet din procedure. The civil process could take five years 
and cost thousands of dollars, said Bayit board President Leonard Friedman. 
</P>
<P>
Cost can be one clear advantage of the bet din. 
</P>
<P>
While the free services provided by Los Angeles Kollel are rare, the process is 
usually inexpensive. Teichman, for example, says he charges a $50 filing fee 
and $300 for each hour spent by the judges in hearing a dispute, plus $200 an 
hour for time the judges confer. Additional fees of about $40 an hour are 
levied for writing the decision, if that is required. "An average case -- not 
an especially complex one -- will cost a total of $500," Teichman estimated. 
</P>
<P>
Another advantage of the bet din is its privacy. Since its hearings and records 
are not public, it is a venue particularly suited to litigants anxious to avoid 
publicity. 
</P>
<P>
The process is also quick. Cases can often be completed in days or weeks. 
Teichman said that the Chabad-Bayit dispute could have been settled in less 
than a year. 
</P>
<P>
The bet din's difficulty in enforcing its decisions, however, may be 
complicated by the politics, relationships and communal intimacy of those 
involved. One Orthodox rabbi cited an example in which a divorced husband would 
not comply with the bet din's order to pay his children's day-school tuition. 
</P>
<P>
The bet din could have put pressure on the man to comply by publicizing his 
recalcitrance in the Jewish community, or at least to school authorities, but 
it avoided doing so in deference to his wealth and community position. 
</P>
<P>
Communal pressure applied privately is often the bet din's best weapon for 
obtaining compliance, especially in cases in which one partner in a marriage 
refuses to allow a divorce to be completed. "In Europe, the bet din could 
actually ostracize a member of the community," said Rabbi David Rue, who has 
served as a bet din judge. "Here, they apply pressure through a person's rabbi 
or friends." 
</P>
<P>
This system of Jewish courts dates back to the time of Moses, who, according to 
the book of Exodus, delegated to wise elders part of his authority as judge in 
order to speed the administration of justice. 
</P>
<P>
Although Jewish law specifically requires Jews to submit their disputes to a 
bet din, even many religious Jews prefer to go to civil court. Some may simply 
have the expectation of getting a better settlement under civil law. Others may 
be loath to apply Jewish law to contracts they entered into under civil law, 
especially given the bet din's lack of enforcement powers. 
</P>
<P>
There have been cases in which the civil courts have refused to enforce a bet 
din's decision even though the parties had signed a binding-arbitration 
agreement. The courts cited the Jewish court's failure to render its decision 
clearly or the inability to fully understand the actual legal basis of the 
dispute. 
</P>
<P>
Los Angeles lawyer Stephen Webb, who has worked with Jews using the bet din 
system, explained that there are "difficulties of interface" between the two 
legal systems. "There is a need to train rabbis in writing decisions that can 
be used in civil court," he said.
