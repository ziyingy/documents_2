The jurors who found that Mike Tyson fondled a woman in a disco were urged 
today to punish the former heavyweight champion and award her punitive damages. 
</P>
<P>
"This type of thing can't happen," the woman's attorney, Alan Clark, said as 
the second phase of the trial opened. 
</P>
<P>
"You just can't go out and do whatever you want." 
</P>
<P>
Clark then recalled Tyson as a witness and questioned him about a financial 
statement that put the fighter's net worth at $15 million as of Feb. 28. 
</P>
<P>
Tyson said he made more than $20 million in 1989 but testified that he didn't 
know his income for this year. 
</P>
<P>
The jury ruled on Tuesday that Tyson grabbed Sandra Miller's breasts and 
buttocks after she refused his advances at Bentley's Disco in Manhattan on Dec. 
10, 1988. 
</P>
<P>
Tyson, who testified during the first phase of the trial, acknowledged that he 
was at Bentley's Disco that night but denied knowing or ever touching Miller. 
</P>
<P>
The jurors awarded Miller $100 in compensatory damages. She is seeking up to 
$2.5 million in punitive damages in her civil lawsuit.
