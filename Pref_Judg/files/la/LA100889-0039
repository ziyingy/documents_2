Americans have become remarkably health conscious. According to a Los Angeles 
Times Poll, they are exercising and reading the labels of food packages. They 
are cutting down on sugar, alcohol and, especially, red meat. They are eating 
more vegetables and drinking more water. 
</P>
<P>
Not everyone is pursuing virtue at the dinner table or in a health club, but 
many Americans, especially women, say good health is what they want most out of 
life. And, increasingly, they are willing to make sacrifices to get what they 
want. 
</P>
<P>
Given only one choice, the survey asked, what is the most important thing in 
life: to be creative, famous, powerful, wealthy, healthy? 
</P>
<P>
Of the 3,583 Americans interviewed, only 1% wanted power, 5% wealth, 6% 
creativity, 8% success; 10% wanted a happy marriage, 16% wanted to help others. 
But a striking 50% of all adults -- 43% of men and 55% of women -- said they 
wanted health and a long life above all else, confirming the popular adage, "If 
you have your health, you have everything." 
</P>
<P>
The Times Poll, directed by I. A. Lewis, conducted its survey of good health by 
telephone during this past summer. On a survey of this size and complexity, the 
margin of error is estimated to be 2 percentage points in either direction. 
</P>
<P>
Apparently spurred by growing publicity about the virtues of exercise, the 
majority of American adults -- 53% of women and 60% of men -- say that they 
exercise regularly. 
</P>
<P>
When asked whether they had in fact exercised the week before, however, an 
overwhelming majority -- 90% of men and 85% of women -- said they had engaged 
in some kind of physical activity or sport in recent days, suggesting that 
almost all Americans exercise sporadically, even if they don't work out 
regularly. 
</P>
<P>
The most popular form of activity was walking (39%), followed by swimming 
(15%), bicycling (8%) and jogging (7%). 
</P>
<P>
"Not surprisingly," Lewis says, "the poll also shows that people who were 
well-to-do and single were more likely than others to exercise. For reasons 
that aren't immediately apparent, liberals and conservatives are more likely 
than middle-of-the-roaders to be involved in exercise. And Republicans are also 
somewhat more likely than Democrats to be frequent exercisers . . . confirming 
the notion that exercise is an an upscale occupation." 
</P>
<P>
Southern Californians, who by reputation wrote the primer on good looks and 
healthy life styles, are, in fact, more likely to exercise than are people 
living in any other part of the country. While more than half of all Americans 
said they exercise regularly, nearly two-thirds of Californians said they are 
habitual exercisers. 
</P>
<P>
New Englanders are also frequent exercisers, The Times Poll found, but, 
according to a survey released last summer by the U.S. Centers for Disease 
Control, New Yorkers are the most sedentary of all Americans. 
</P>
<P>
Weather does not seem to explain fully the higher exercises rate in Southern 
California, according to The Times Poll. 
</P>
<P>
Even though most Americans say they exercise outdoors at least part of the 
time, inclement weather does not seem to deter them from their activities. Only 
about one of four people outside Southern California complained that it was 
sometimes too hot or too cold to exercise, and nearly one of five Southern 
Californians says he or she faced similar difficulties, despite the general 
perception that the weather is nearly always mild in their part of the world. 
</P>
<P>
Contrary to popular opinion, Californians are not as hedonistic or vain as the 
rest of the country would like to believe. They are less likely than other 
Americans to exercise simply to improve their looks, and they are somewhat more 
likely to exercise for better health, although the majority of all Americans 
say their primary reason for exercising is to make themselves healthier. 
</P>
<P>
Californians are also more likely than other Americans to be injured at sports; 
they spend slightly more money on buying equipment and paying health-club dues 
to make themselves healthier and they are more determined than other Americans 
to choose vacation spots where it is possible to exercise. 
</P>
<P>
While Americans seem to be exercising more than they used to do, they are not 
exercising nearly as much as doctors believe they should to keep their bodies 
trim and to keep their internal organs, such as their hearts and lungs, fit. 
</P>
<P>
Only about 8% of adult Americans are getting as much exercise as the 
now-standard government recommendation for the level and type of exercise 
desirable for good health, according to surveys released this summer by the 
Centers for Disease Control. Basically that recommendation is that healthy 
adults should spend 15 to 25 minutes a day, three to four days a week, doing 
some form of exercise vigorous enough to elevate breathing and heart rates but 
not so vigorous that it becomes impossible to talk comfortably. 
</P>
<P>
According to the CDC studies, another 34% of American adults were "regularly 
active," that is they walked or did some other kind of physical activity at 
least three times a week for a minimum of 20 minutes a session but at levels of 
intensity below those now recommended. 
</P>
<P>
The Times Poll shows that the typical American reported spending 6.3 hours a 
week on strenuous exercise, considerably higher than the CDC estimates suggest. 
The discrepancy between these and other surveys may in part be due to what has 
been found in studies at USC and elsewhere: some people, particularly highly 
competitive, compulsive Type A personalities, tend to overestimate the time 
they spend exercising. 
</P>
<P>
"Doing exercise, to one person, might mean running for 40 minutes. To another, 
it might mean stooping and bending or touching the toes 10 times a day," says 
Gregory Heath, a CDC epidemiologist and exercise physiologist. 
</P>
<P>
Whereas The Times Poll allowed people to define for themselves what it means to 
"exercise regularly" and what is meant by "strenuous exercise," the CDC surveys 
asked very precise, detailed questions and applied rigorous definitions to 
those answers. The end result is that people probably are not exercising quite 
as much as they think they are, Heath says. 
</P>
<P>
Nonetheless, Heath adds, it is "quite true" that health consciousness is on the 
rise -- at least in some parts of the country and among some socio-economic 
groups. 
</P>
<P>
"Because of many factors, partly just life style . . . the likelihood that 
people are exercising in Los Angeles is much greater than it is in Dubuque, 
Iowa," Heath says. 
</P>
<P>
Women and the elderly seem to be exercising a good deal more than they once 
did, whereas blue-collar workers are exercising less, the government surveys 
show. Whether it is working on the docks unloading ships or collecting trash, 
many low-paying, manual jobs are becoming increasingly automated so that 
blue-collar workers are expending less physical energy at work. At the same 
time, Heath says, the people who hold such jobs do not seem to be nearly as 
attracted to leisure-time exercise activities as are better-educated, more 
well-to-do Americans. 
</P>
<P>
Yet exercise is not the most important step people say they have taken during 
the past year to improve their health. Going on a diet was cited as the most 
significant action taken by nearly a third of those interviewed by The Times. 
</P>
<P>
Despite pronouncements from the fashion world that well-muscled, voluptuous 
bodies are now in style, most Americans seem to think that thin is in. As a 
result, twice as many women think they are overweight as really are. While 48% 
of women say they are too heavy, only 25% actually are, according to a formula 
for proper weight devised by the CDC. Men, on the other hand, are somewhat less 
likely to be overweight and they are also less likely to think they weigh too 
much. While 39% say they weigh more than they should, 22% really are 
overweight, according to the CDC scale. 
</P>
<P>
(People who are underweight, for the most part, think they are the proper 
weight. And almost everyone who is overweight knows he or she is overweight.) 
</P>
<P>
While many Americans think they need to diet, giving up food may be the most 
difficult of all steps for people to take in their quest for better health. 
Although only one in five Americans says it is hard to exercise and one in four 
says it is difficult to quit smoking, one in three says that it is hardest to 
cut down on food. It is hard for both men and women, although women do have a 
somewhat tougher time dieting, as they have a somewhat tougher time exercising 
than men do. 
</P>
<P>
Despite these difficulties, one in five men and one in three of women say they 
are now on a diet, although the vast majority -- 96% of the men and 82% of the 
women -- have never used commercial diets such as Weight Watchers or 
NutriSystems. 
</P>
<P>
Sweets are by far the biggest temptation for American adults. Two out of three 
pick ice cream, cake, chocolate, candy, cookies or doughnuts as the food they 
have the most trouble resisting. Pizza comes in a distant second, with 8% 
reporting this delicacy as their Achilles heel. 
</P>
<P>
While they may like foods that are not terribly good for them, Americans, and 
especially Californians, are now mindful enough of what they eat that they have 
taken to reading the labels of food products. About 59% of Southern 
Californians and 50% of people elsewhere say they now routinely look at labels 
before making purchases. Many report that they have given up or cut down on 
some foods: 23% say they eat less red meat; 19% say they drink less beer, wine 
or hard liquor; 12% say they consume less sugar. 
</P>
<P>
Similarly, many people claim to be eating more of some healthful foods. Water 
and vegetables, for example, top the list of consumables that are on the rise 
in popularity. According to The Times Poll, 21% of Americans are drinking more 
water today than they did five years; 21% are eating more vegetables; 15% are 
eating more fruits. Fish, poultry and diet drinks are also on the rise. 
</P>
<P>
Overall, relatively few people reported consuming much in the way of liquor. Of 
those surveyed, 69% of women and 46% of men say they don't drink at all. The 
majority of people who do drink consume relatively little -- less than a glass 
of wine, beer or one drink of hard liquor a day. 
</P>
<P>
Smoking is a habit that virtually everyone said they want to give up. Yet 23% 
of women and 9% of men have never even gone one day without a cigarette. 
</P>
<P>
Stress is one of the factors, along with improper diet and inadequate exercise, 
that is thought to contribute to heart disease and other health problems. Two 
of three Americans say they regularly experience stress and one of three 
reports having a great deal of stress. Women are more likely than men to find 
stress in their lives. And Californians are quite a bit less likely than other 
Americans to lead stressful lives. 
</P>
<P>
The No. 1 stress reliever in American is to do nothing. One of three says he or 
she does not do anything in particular to relieve stress. The second most 
popular remedy is exercise, used as a stress-reducer by 17% of the population 
as a whole and 20% of Californians.
