The past three days have been the hottest ever in April in Orange County. On 
Thursday a 112-degree reading was recorded in El Toro.

But today will be the last day of record-setting heat, according to Pat Cooper, 
a meteorologist for WeatherData, which provides forecasts for The Times.

"Over the weekend it looks like we'll have more of a sea breeze. The ridge of 
high pressure that's bringing the hot weather will break down," she said.

But Cooper still expects weekend temperatures in the 90s around the county and 
she added that some areas may reach 100-degree readings. By Monday or Tuesday, 
she said, temperatures will drop to the 80s inland and the 70s along the coast.
