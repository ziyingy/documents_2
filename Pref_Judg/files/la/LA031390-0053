Walt Disney Co. plans to build a giant commercial office park, up to 6,000 
single family homes and the largest shopping mall in central Florida, a 
newspaper reported. 
</P>
<P>
The development, which would be Disney's first on its Osceola County property, 
would be built on 4,400 acres straddling Interstate 4, the Orlando Sentinel 
reported.

<P>
Orange and Osceola county officials who were briefed about the plans last week 
told the Sentinel that Disney was to announce its project at its annual "State 
of Our World" presentation on Monday.

<P>
Disney officials did not confirm the report.

"There's nothing to chat about," Disney spokesman John Dreyer said. "I hope 
they've got good crystal balls. I'm not confirming anything. Tell them to come 
to the show on Monday. Come see the 'State of Our World' and find out."

County officials said they were told that Disney planned up to 6,000 
middle-income and executive houses with a starting price of $90,000, the 
Sentinel reported Saturday.

Plans also call for between 6 million and 7 million square feet of commercial 
office space, about 1.2 million square feet of light-industrial office and 
manufacturing space, one or two golf courses and recreation areas, officials 
cited in the report said.

Several community leaders who have seen the plans said Disney did not present 
any timetable for construction or dollar value, the paper said.

Disney owns 8,700 acres in the area, of which 40% is swamp, drainage watershed 
and canals.
