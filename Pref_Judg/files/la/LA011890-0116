El Camino guard Larry Lockley was pretty inactive in the first half of 
Wednesday night's South Coast Conference game against Long Beach. But the 
6-foot-2 sophomore prevailed with six points in the remaining four minutes to 
secure the Warriors' 77-69 victory at home.

<P>
Sophomore forward Jamal Ross contributed eight, six of them in the last two 
minutes, to improve El Camino's record to 17-6 and 2-2 in the South Coast 
Conference. 
</P>
<P>
Long Beach went into the game as the only undefeated team in the five-member 
SCC. The Vikings fell to 12-11 and 2-1.

"I thought Long Beach was going to come at us harder in the second half," said 
El Camino Coach Ron McClurkin. "I was ready for their full-court press.' 
</P>
<P>
The Vikings didn't need to utilize it in the first half thanks to poor El 
Camino shooting and an array of unforced turnovers. 
</P>
<P>
The Warriors fell behind in the opening minutes of the game. With 11:58 left in 
the half El Camino trailed by 10 after Long Beach's Michael Jackson hit an 
eight-foot jumper from the left side.

The Warriors came to within three, 22-25, after a Darius Dubose bank shot with 
6:45 left in the half. Back-to-back three-pointers by El Camino's Keishaun 
Darthard and David Keeter shaved the Vikings' lead to 28-30 with 3:54 remaining 
for the break. Long Beach had a 36-33 halftime lead.

El Camino took its first lead two minutes into the second half when Steve 
Leary's tip-in put the Warriors up, 38-37. With 7:52 left to play, El Camino 
led by three after a seven-point run that included a Keeter three-pointer and 
pair of Lockley baskets. 
</P>
<P>
After Lockley's three buckets in the final minutes, El Camino was up 68-62. Two 
Ross baskets followed and the Warrior lead increased to 72-62 with 1:28 left.

El Camino will play the Naval Training Academy in Saturday's non-conference 
game. The Warriors resume league action on Jan. 27 at Mt. San Antonio College.
