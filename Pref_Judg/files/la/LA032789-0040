<P>
Assemblyman Frank Hill was a man in a hurry, his critics say, like a driver 
careening down the highway heading for calamity. 
</P>
<P>
Even his political allies concede that the 35-year-old Whittier Republican 
courted trouble by boasting of his ability to use choice committee assignments 
and his influence with the governor's office to raise money for legislative 
races. 
</P>
<P>
"He was cruising for a bruising," said a former Republican legislative aide. 
</P>
<P>
The crash came last Aug. 24 when the FBI began a late-night search of Hill's 
office and the offices of three other legislators, the culmination of a 
three-year federal sting operation that targeted political corruption in the 
Capitol. 
</P>
<P>
Neither Hill nor any other legislator whose office was searched has been 
charged with a crime. 
</P>
<P>
But for the last seven months, since the FBI raid, the usually affable Hill has 
kept a low public profile. A spokesman for Hill said he has been advised not to 
make statements to the press. 
</P>
<P>
However, a detailed review of public records and dozens of interviews with 
legislators, aides, and lobbyists reveal that Hill has had a dangerous 
attraction to what his colleagues call "juice bills" -- special-interest 
legislation that can be counted on to win sizable campaign contributions and 
speaking fees. In the course of that review, The Times has learned that: 
</P>
<P>
* In at least two instances Hill may have violated the state's 
conflict-of-interest law by taking part in decisions that affect companies that 
paid him substantial speaking fees. 
</P>
<P>
* In numerous other cases, he carried or supported special-interest bills 
affecting groups that courted or rewarded him with gifts, campaign 
contributions and honorariums. 
</P>
<P>
* The FBI is continuing to review Hill's conduct in an inquiry ranging far 
beyond the sting itself and examining two bills that Hill authored for special 
interests. 
</P>
<P>
At an unusually young age, Hill became what Capitol insiders described as a 
"player" -- someone who would stake out positions on controversial issues and 
had to be reckoned with in any settlement. Before the sting controversy hit, 
Hill would talk openly about using his position as a GOP leader and vice 
chairman of the Assembly Governmental Organization Committee to raise money for 
campaigns. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
'Good Fund-Raiser' 
</P>
<P>
"Sure, I'm a good fund-raiser. I'm one of the best in our caucus," Hill said in 
an interview two years ago. 
</P>
<P>
A former Republican legislative staff member described Hill's role more 
bluntly: "That was Frank's job, to make sure all our traditional friends who 
took us for granted knew that there was now going to be a price tag. . . . He 
used to brag how much money he raised, that he was the bagman for the caucus." 
</P>
<P>
Federal investigators have been focusing on Hill's dealings with special 
interests. 
</P>
<P>
This month, for example, FBI agents questioned officials of the Society of 
California Accountants about a $2,000 payment made to Hill in October, 1987, by 
the group's political action committee, the Independent CPA Practitioners 
Foundation. 
</P>
<P>
Although Hill reported the payment as an honorarium for a "speech," he never 
delivered a speech to the society, said the foundation's executive vice 
president, Charles A. Deen, one of those interviewed by the FBI. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Advance Payment 
</P>
<P>
Deen said he sent the check a week after Hill met with a small group of society 
members at a get-acquainted lunch to discuss a bill that Hill had agreed to 
carry for the accountants. The measure later died in the Legislature. The 
money, according to Deen, was intended as an advance payment for a speech at 
one of the group's annual meetings in the spring. The meetings were held as 
scheduled, but Deen said he was unable to make arrangements with Hill for a 
speaking date. 
</P>
<P>
A few weeks ago, the FBI also obtained records of a bill Hill authored last 
year for Nickels &amp; Dimes Inc., a Texas-based chain of amusement arcades. 
</P>
<P>
The measure would have cleared up questions about the legality of "crane 
games," devices found in arcades, bars and liquor stores that require customers 
to manipulate a claw mechanism for a chance to pick up prizes. Los Angeles 
Police Department officials, who conducted an undercover investigation of the 
games, contend that the claw devices -- like slot machines -- can easily be 
tampered with and amount to games of chance, which are banned under state law. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Case Became Test 
</P>
<P>
Nickels &amp; Dimes Inc., owner of the Goldmine Arcade in Los Angeles, was 
among those prosecuted for operating crane games. The case, which quickly 
became a test of whether the machines were permitted by California law, 
resulted in a hung jury last year. All charges against the firm have since been 
dropped. 
</P>
<P>
But in the midst of its legal battle, Nickels &amp; Dimes decided to settle the 
matter by asking the Legislature to change the law. "Why fight it out for 10 
years (in court)?" asked Nickels &amp; Dimes lobbyist Scott R. Keene. The 
lobbyist reported that FBI agents have interviewed him about the measure, which 
ultimately was killed in committee. 
</P>
<P>
Investigators have obtained copies of lobbying reports filed with the secretary 
of state by Nickels &amp; Dimes as well as Keene's lobbying firm. Those reports 
do not show any payments made to Hill or his campaign committee. 
</P>
<P>
However, the center of the FBI's probe continues to be the meeting Hill had 
last June 27 with three undercover agents posing as businessmen in a room at 
Sacramento's Hyatt Regency Hotel across the street from the Capitol, according 
to information pieced together from sources familiar with the investigation and 
Hill's annual financial disclosure statement. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Special-Interest Bill 
</P>
<P>
At the meeting, the "businessmen" handed Hill a check for $2,500 drawn on the 
account of Peachstate Capital West Ltd., a bogus company set up by the FBI as 
part of the sting. The agents were seeking support for a special-interest bill 
that supposedly would have helped Peachstate build a shrimp-processing plant in 
West Sacramento. 
</P>
<P>
FBI agents repeatedly asked Hill, who was accompanied by Republican legislative 
consultant Karin Watson, whether they could help him out with "green stuff" -- 
a cash payment of some kind -- and even offered to take him on a helicopter 
duck-hunting trip. By one account, Hill accepted the check but turned down the 
offer of cash. Sources indicate that the meeting was taped. 
</P>
<P>
Hill frequently received substantial honorariums, gifts and travel expenses as 
well as campaign contributions from companies and trade groups whose bills he 
carried or supported. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Conflict-of-Interest Laws 
</P>
<P>
In at least two cases, he may have violated the state's conflict-of-interest 
law, which prohibits elected officials from playing a role in decisions 
affecting businesses that have provided them with gifts or income of $250 or 
more in the previous 12 months. However, the law has a major loophole that 
exempts legislators and other state elected officials from its penalty 
provisions. 
</P>
<P>
In one instance, Hill voted for a measure to add the popular anti-ulcer 
medication Zantac to the list of drugs approved for Medi-Cal patients, just 
weeks after receiving a $2,000 honorarium from the manufacturer, Glaxo Inc. of 
North Carolina. The payment was for speaking to a meeting of company personnel 
in California, Glaxo spokesman Jim Shamp said. 
</P>
<P>
In the other case, Hill reported receiving a $2,500 speaking fee and $541 in 
meals and accommodations from Sunrise/Desert Partners, a firm planning a resort 
development in the city of Indian Wells. Those payments came during the six 
months before Hill voted for a bill lobbied by Sunrise that would have 
benefited that development. The measure ultimately was vetoed by the governor 
last year. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Openly Critical 
</P>
<P>
Consumers Union lobbyist Harry Snyder is openly critical of Hill. 
</P>
<P>
"If you would say to people in the Capitol that this is a Frank Hill bill, 
their eyes would roll up in their heads," Snyder said. "They'd view it with 
suspicion." 
</P>
<P>
However, Hill has his defenders. 
</P>
<P>
"He never did anything wrong," said ex-Sen. H. L. Richardson (R-Glendora), who 
helped fund Hill's initial Assembly campaign in 1982. "He's not the type who 
goes out and does dumb things. Frank will lead out with a strong statement once 
in a while. It's more baloney than fact. 
</P>
<P>
"I personally have never known him to do anything illegal. . . . He's more 
boastful. He's not the kind who would go in to leverage (a bill) to feather his 
own pocketbook." 
</P>
<P>
In his legislative work, Hill has been a champion of making English the 
official state language and has worked to give local school districts more 
control over bilingual education. 
</P>
<P>
A hunter and outdoorsman, he has impressed colleagues -- Democrats as well as 
Republicans -- by fighting for measures intended to clean up the environment. 
And for his district, he carried one of the bills granting relief to victims of 
the 1987 Whittier earthquake. 
</P>
<P>
In late 1987, Hill became the Assembly GOP's "liaison to the governor" -- one 
of four Republican legislative leaders who meet regularly with Gov. George 
Deukmejian. 
</P>
<P>
His rise was rapid and rewarding financially. 
</P>
<P>
During the 1987-88 legislative session, only four legislators reported 
receiving more money in speaking fees and honorariums than Hill, who collected 
$48,892. 
</P>
<P>
He has also become one of the Assembly's top campaign fund-raisers, using the 
money he collects to support other Republican candidates and to maintain a 
political apparatus that he scarcely needs to keep his own Assembly seat. Over 
an 18-month period, ending June 30, 1988, only eight legislators doled out more 
money to other candidates, according to a report prepared by the Fair Political 
Practices Commission. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Controversial Legislation 
</P>
<P>
Since he won election to the Legislature in 1982, Hill has often been involved 
in controversial legislation. But he has managed to do so without alienating 
colleagues. 
</P>
<P>
"He has more friends than any other legislator," said Assemblyman Gil Ferguson 
(R-Newport Beach). "He never did anything to make anybody mad at him." 
</P>
<P>
"Charming" is the way a number of legislators describe him. Maybe a little too 
"brash" at times, but definitely "likable" is the consensus. 
</P>
<P>
"Frank can be the life of a party," said a lobbyist who knows him well. "He can 
be the first person to put a lamp shade on his head." 
</P>
<P>
Born in El Paso, the oldest of six children, Hill got his start in politics 
while in high school, when he worked on the reelection campaign of 
then-Assemblyman Bill Campbell, now a Republican state senator from Hacienda 
Heights. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Moved to Washington 
</P>
<P>
While a senior at UCLA, he volunteered for S. I. Hayakawa's 1976 U.S. Senate 
campaign. When Hayakawa won the primary, Hill, fresh out of college, became a 
full-time member of the campaign staff. After Hayakawa upset incumbent 
Democratic Sen. John V. Tunney that fall, Hill moved to Washington to work in 
the new senator's office. 
</P>
<P>
He has been in government ever since. His official legislative biography's 
description of him as a "legislator-businessman" notwithstanding, Hill's only 
business experience during his pre-legislative days was occasional political 
consulting work. 
</P>
<P>
In 1979, Hill moved back to California to run then-Rep. Wayne Grisham's 
Whittier office. He was looking for an opportunity to break into politics 
himself, Republican Grisham said. 
</P>
<P>
He soon found it. In 1982, at age 28, Hill ran for a vacant Assembly seat in a 
district where the winner of the Republican primary could be expected to be 
victorious in the general election as well. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
'Not Very Correct' 
</P>
<P>
His chief Republican opponent, Barbara Shell Stone, said she was annoyed that 
Hill ran while remaining on Grisham's payroll and collecting a federal salary 
of $3,320 a month. "Ethically, he should have resigned and not campaigned on 
taxpayers' money," Stone said. "It's not illegal, but it's not very correct." 
</P>
<P>
Hill beat Stone by 1,593 votes. Then, in the November general election, Hill 
won 66% of the vote. 
</P>
<P>
Even after the FBI investigation became public, Hill's popularity with voters 
in his district seemed to be hardly dented. In November, he was reelected with 
63% of the vote. 
</P>
<P>
Some Republican legislators report that Hill has been quieter since the FBI's 
Capitol raid, but they express confidence that he can survive politically. 
</P>
<P>
Ex-Assemblyman Grisham is certain that Hill did nothing wrong in accepting a 
$2,500 payment from the bogus FBI company, declaring: "I really think the FBI 
people are not used to the way Californians work. What they thought was illegal 
was perfectly legal." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Proper Role 
</P>
<P>
But one veteran Capitol lobbyist, who has worked with Hill on several bills and 
clashed with him on others, believes that the assemblyman lost sight of his 
proper role as a legislator. 
</P>
<P>
"Frank Hill came up here as a young man, very naive," the lobbyist said. 
"What's happened is one of those things, where you dip your hands into water 
three or four times and don't get hurt and you figure you'll never get hurt. . 
. . He got sucked into it all and ended up going too far and got caught." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
