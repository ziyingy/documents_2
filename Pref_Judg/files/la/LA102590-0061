A Camarillo man has pleaded guilty in Ventura County Superior Court to 
vehicular manslaughter in the hit-and-run death of a Simi Valley assistant city 
planner in June.

Daniel Oseguera, 28, faces up to 12 years in state prison after pleading guilty 
on Tuesday to charges of gross vehicular manslaughter while intoxicated and 
felony hit-and-run in the accident that killed Steven Sugimoto, 28, west of 
Moorpark.

Sugimoto was bicycling west along the paved shoulder of California 118 about 
4:15 p.m. June 10 when Oseguera approached from the rear in a 1979 Oldsmobile 
Cutlass, said Deputy Dist. Atty. Kim George Gibbons.

Witnesses told investigators that Oseguera was speeding and passing cars on the 
right when he slammed into Sugimoto, throwing him to the ground, Gibbons said. 
Sugimoto suffered massive head and internal injuries and died later at Pleasant 
Valley Hospital, Gibbons said.

Oseguera sped up after the impact and drove away, and police chased him for 5 
1/2 miles to Lewis Road in Somis, where a passenger in his car, 30-year-old 
David Rojas of Oxnard, grabbed the wheel and persuaded him to stop, Gibbons 
said.

Tests taken nearly two hours afterward showed that Oseguera had a blood-alcohol 
content of 0.17%, more than twice the legal 0.08% limit, Gibbons said. But he 
said there was no evidence that Oseguera had used drugs, despite his admission 
to police that he had injected heroin an hour before the accident. MACK REED
