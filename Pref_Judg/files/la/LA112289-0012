On the front page (Nov.17) were the following two headlines: "Six Jesuit 
Priests Slain in Salvador" and "Pro-Choice Lawmaker Is Barred From Church 
Rite." I'm sure I'm not the only person to notice the incredible irony of the 
situation.

On one hand, we see dedicated Jesuit priests willing to die for their beliefs, 
one of which is their concept of freedom. On the other hand, we have a priest 
withholding a sacrament because an elected official has used her freedom to 
disagree with the church. What's wrong with this picture?
