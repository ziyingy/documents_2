In what he believed is the largest such seizure in the world, state Atty. Gen. 
John K. Van de Kamp staged a press conference Friday surrounded by more than 
1,000 pounds of the drug methamphetamine and $1 million in $100 bills. Four men 
arrested on a variety of drug charges in connection with the seizure are headed 
for federal court trials that could cost them as much as 40 years in prison, 
Van de Kamp said, with the "mastermind" possibly facing a life term.
