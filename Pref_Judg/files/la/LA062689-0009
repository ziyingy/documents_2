A sailor aboard a disabled pleasure boat and five crewmen from a passing 
freighter, who tried to rescue him but also fell victim to rough seas, were 
finally rescued about 900 miles west of San Francisco, the Coast Guard said. 
The Panamanian merchant ship, Washington Rainbow II, received a Mayday call 
from the sailor when his boat, Juicy Anna, lost a mast and began taking on 
water, Coast Guard officials said in Long Beach. After the 45-year-old San 
Francisco captain of the Juicy Anna, whose name was not immediately available, 
lost his life raft, five crew members from the merchant ship launched their 
lifeboat and pulled the man safely aboard, officials said. But the lifeboat 
lost power in the 15-foot seas, which Hall described as "hazardous" to small 
vessels. Coast Guard officials then contacted a 560-foot American-registered 
freighter, the President Lincoln, to go to the area and crew members rescued 
the six men, the Coast Guard said.
