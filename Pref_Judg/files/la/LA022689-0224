"On the first day of class, they look like stunned mullets. I mean, they don't 
know what hit them. 
</P>
<P>
"On the second day, depression sets in -- when they realize how hard it is. And 
then on the third day, I give 'em a shot in the arm, inspire them, because 
screenwriting is the most difficult writing form of all -- because there is no 
place to hide." 
</P>
<P>
And then Robert McKee -- businessman, master teacher, the swami of scripts -- 
breaks into a hearty laugh at the strangeness of it all: "All I wanted when I 
came out here -- as if this wasn't enough -- was to write and direct my own 
screenplays." 
</P>
<P>
McKee, 47, lives in an art-filled, 24th-floor apartment on the Westside. After 
welcoming a reporter, the one-time stage actor and director, studio story 
analyst and TV series writer lights up the first of many cigarettes and 
explains how he became one of the world's most successful screenwriting 
teachers, how he can jet to New York and Chicago, to London and Auckland, to 
teach a modern world the ancient art of storytelling. It is a seamless 
narrative; he has told the story often. 
</P>
<P>
This being Hollywood, McKee isn't shy about self-promotion: "I believe that 
this course I teach stands head and shoulders above the rest. This course has 
grown into such a phenomenon worldwide, the kind of quality of people who take 
the course -- Academy Award winners, all kinds of executives as well as writers 
-- has made me feel that what I do is very valuable, that it really makes a 
difference." 
</P>
<P>
McKee's "Story Structure" class does attract a lot of industry attention; more 
than half the students at his seminars work in television or film. The class 
brochure is embellished with testimonials from celebrities who have taken it -- 
director Mark Rydell, producer Gene Reynolds, even former Ms. magazine 
publisher Gloria Steinem. McKee proudly displays a letter from Jack Valenti, 
president of the Motion Picture Assn. of America, enrolling in a recent 
seminar. 
</P>
<P>
And, noting others have also "seen the possibilities of this," McKee asks that 
he not be "bunched into an article about a survey of screenwriting gurus." 
</P>
<P>
(McKee has certainly mastered the "possibilities": He teaches monthly in Los 
Angeles, four times a year in New York and three times a year in London as well 
as classes in other major cities around the world. At $300 a pop, McKee expects 
to teach 2,000 students this year, enough to support three full-time staff 
members as well as some part-timers, and to maintain offices here and in New 
York. He also offers personal script consultations for $1,000, as well as 
consultation to film studios and networks. "My accountant points out that I 
make a very nice living," McKee said, "but there's a lot of overhead too.") 
</P>
<P>
After earning a master's in drama at the University of Michigan, McKee -- who 
is the father of two children and is separated from his wife -- moved to New 
York, eventually directing about 60 plays as well as acting in Off-Broadway, 
repertory and summer stock productions. After seven years of the gypsy theater 
life, McKee went back to the University of Michigan to get a doctoral degree 
that "would be something I could take to Hollywood, something that would 
enhance my work when I got out there." His thesis became the underpinning of 
"Story Structure." 
</P>
<P>
He came west in 1979, first teaching at San Diego State University, then 
becoming a story analyst at United Artists and NBC, but his ambition was to be 
a film director. He turned to screenwriting when he couldn't get anyone to hire 
him to direct -- "I discovered that to make it in Hollywood, you have to write 
your own screenplay." 
</P>
<P>
In 1981, McKee sold his first script, to AVCO/Embassy, and has had eight 
feature film screenplays purchased or optioned since then. Only one, "Madness," 
is currently in active development, with a small Italian company, Serio 
International. He also wrote scripts for TV "cop shows and like that, making a 
living as a writer, somehow, between the options and the TV. While I was 
waiting for one of these (feature) screenplays to strike gold -- to get to the 
screen, so I can twist the arms of Hollywood on the second one and get to 
direct -- I was invited to teach at Sherwood Oaks Experimental College." 
</P>
<P>
It was McKee's experience as a story analyst that set the subject matter at 
Sherwood Oaks (no longer in existence). "When I got out here, as a story 
analyst, I thought, 'Everyone understands story' -- until I started to read. 
And then I discovered what everyone knows is true, that 99 out of a 100 
screenplays are terribly told. And then I found out the reality of Hollywood: 
Over the past 20 years the whole craft, the fundamental understanding of the 
craft of storytelling, has rapidly gone downhill. 
</P>
<P>
"I knew this course had to be about story structure, that it would be a waste 
of time to be talking about the refinements of style, of dialogue, of 
characterization, the screenplay's surface." 
</P>
<P>
McKee -- who says that "in the '30s and '40s, even the worst B movie had a good 
story" -- blames the loss of good storytelling craft on three factors: 
</P>
<P>
 -- The end of the studio system, in which writers were handled by "real story 
editors, most of them anonymous, most of them women, who really knew structure" 
and who had the time to educate, to apprentice a writer. 
</P>
<P>
 -- The shift in emphasis at universities from teaching the "inner life of a 
story -- deep character, the powerful controlling idea -- to textural analysis. 
The deep structures of storytelling became an embarrassment to the scholar; 
they forgot that structure is more important than anything; it's the grand 
form, it contains the deepest, most powerful choices the artist makes, the most 
powerful expression of their vision." 
</P>
<P>
 -- The time we live in. Because everyone is confused about values, "there's 
this tremendous subjectivization, relativization of values . . . consequently 
there's a great confusion in the minds of writers about what to write about, 
what is meaningful . . . a disintegration of understanding about values," 
values that are at the heart of storytelling. 
</P>
<P>
McKee, looking very professorial in sweater and slacks, enters Lucas Building 
Theatre 108 at USC. 
</P>
<P>
Fifty students -- pros and amateurs, studio executives and underlings, actors 
and wanna-be's -- lean forward, seriously checking him out, each wondering if 
the teacher is as good as advertised, wondering if they should have spent the 
$300 tuition fee on a weekend in Mazatlan. 
</P>
<P>
McKee wins over the most skeptical. He's a performer as well as a master 
teacher who, in 20 hours over three days, will attempt to teach them the 
complex art of writing a simple story, well-told. 
</P>
<P>
And -- no surprise -- the Gospel According to McKee starts with story 
structure. 
</P>
<P>
"I make it real clear in the first hour: This course is not about formula. You 
cannot take the greatest, most mysterious art form there is and reduce it to a 
formula -- that's absurd. There is 
</P>
<P>
such a thing as form -- when that form is present we instinctively react to it. 
That response can be to 'Tender Mercies' or to 'Raiders of the Lost Ark.' When 
you come out, you go, 'What a good story.' You react to it. You have been 
touched by a form, worked through a form, satisfied intellectually and 
emotionally by the great form of that story." 
</P>
<P>
McKee gets most passionate when emphasizing the prominence of classic story 
structure to the class, the need for a powerful "controlling idea" -- the "one 
clear sentence that distills the essence of the film" -- to drive the story. 
</P>
<P>
The essence of good story is unchanging and universal: McKee's students must 
learn classic story structure because "everything works in the shadow of it. If 
you want to write minimalistic or anti-structure then you must know the grand 
form first." Classic structure "works, this has worked since Homer; these are 
the functions of story, the particular way you make it work is your problem. 
</P>
<P>
"Structure is not some simplistic form of beginnings, middles and ends. It's a 
very clear, deep understanding for the writer of the metaphors for life, an 
exploration of the craft of writing as it echoes in their life -- stories are a 
metaphor for life." 
</P>
<P>
He gets in a dig at his teaching rival, Syd Field, saying Field's book, 
"Screenplay," has "done more harm than good. . . . Field's book says, 'You too 
can be a hack.' " 
</P>
<P>
(Field, in a phone interview, retorts: "McKee says I teach people to write by 
the numbers -- for me, story structure is flexible, the tree that bends but 
will not break. When I write that a plot point should occur between page 25 and 
27, that depends on the film; it could just as easily come at page 18 or 35. 
</P>
<P>
("I get a lot of people in my classes who have taken his class and who don't 
know how to write a screenplay.") 
</P>
<P>
McKee plays to the student writers' egos, telling them that everything starts 
with the writer, the story: "It's the most difficult time to be a writer, also 
the most challenging. A writer, cast on their own, really has to be wise, to 
come to a deep understanding of their values, to make an original exploration 
of what life really means. It's not a given anymore. 
</P>
<P>
"You cannot hide behind language (like in the novel or theater). A screenwriter 
. . . cannot manipulate perception; screenwriters are hanging bare-naked and 
the camera sees through every flaw." 
</P>
<P>
Jeff Kleeman, 24, a junior executive at a major studio who calls himself "an 
apprentice in the industry," says that the USC seminar "is a great starting 
point. McKee is very articulate, charming, he schematized class in a very 
intelligent if somewhat closed system. My guess is that if he were a studio 
executive he would never give the green light to a bad script but might pass on 
a good script that didn't fit into his format. Part of McKee's charm is his 
arrogance, which ruled out most dialogue with the students." 
</P>
<P>
Another student at the USC seminar, Marsha Bentley Hale, 36, a film archivist 
"for a major director," said the seminar "gave me insight into structure and 
form, things that were helpful to me. Something that he said 'clicked' with me, 
was very helpful to a teleplay (script for a theme park attraction) that I'm 
working on." 
</P>
<P>
McKee doesn't promise a pot of gold waiting at the end of the course, and 
repeatedly hammers home that it won't be easy, that the students will have to 
dig deep within themselves to produce a quality script: "One fine service this 
course may do is to make it very clear to would-be's as to what a very 
difficult tightrope they have stepped upon, that it's going to take a 
tremendous amount of skill, craft to get from one end to the other. 
</P>
<P>
"I think I save a lot of people a lot of time -- it'll take you five 
screenplays to figure out how to write a screenplay." 
</P>
<P>
While "Story Structure" may pay the bills, McKee keeps pounding away at 
Hollywood through his production company, Two Arts Productions. He began 
working with 10 of his students to produce scripts that he could market to 
Hollywood. "A few years ago, I opened workshops beyond the class. Getting very 
frustrated that screenplays I sold or had optioned got into pre-production and 
then didn't make it to the screen -- I decided to use my expertise as a story 
editor, to take the best author development contracts to the best of these 
young writers. 
</P>
<P>
"So I gave them contracts, to add to their work a lot of my own creative 
contributions -- wanting nothing in terms of their money -- to see if I could 
get them into production. A horror film is finished, a beautiful piece by Doug 
Erickson called 'Mirror, Mirror' getting very nice coverage around town 
(Erickson says "Mirror" was not optioned, but purchased outright by McKee's 
production company); out of the 10 that I drew, four, maybe five, became viable 
screenplays and two of them, possibly a third, will get produced." 
</P>
<P>
The payoff for him? "Hopefully, I'll direct them." And, there will be the 
financial reward for Two Arts when and if the projects are picked up by a film 
studio. 
</P>
<P>
And if that doesn't work out, there's still his writing. "Meanwhile, my 
screenplays are doing very well. I've just finished a project called 'Madness' 
in co-production with Serio International of Rome; I will direct that. That was 
through my development company with one of my development writers, Mike 
Gonzalez (Gonzalez and McKee share co-writing credit). And one of my own called 
'Miss Julie' -- I have a deal with Zev Braun (Productions) to direct that, I'm 
polishing that." (Braun, who took McKee's seminar -- 'It's the real thing, 
digging into making a complete script, not patching one together' -- says 'Miss 
Julie' is in active development.) 
</P>
<P>
"I'm not alone in this experience of continually selling your own screenplays, 
losing the roll of the dice," McKee said. "This town is full of people like 
myself, who sell consistently, but have a hard time getting produced -- just 
bad luck. The studios typically option 95 scripts for every five they produce, 
so it's not unusual to find someone in my situation, taking eight years to 
finally get it to the screen." 
</P>
<P>
McKee gets a little defensive about his cash flow: "In teaching this class over 
the years, despite the success and the money making, the truth of the matter is 
that I could have probably made a lot more money writing television episodes 
with one-fifth of the work. (McKee has sold seven episodes of one-hour shows, 
including "Columbo" and "Quincy," and the short-lived "Double Dare" and "Eye to 
Eye.") 
</P>
<P>
"There are all kinds of ways to look at what I do, but the people who have 
taken the course know that I take that enterprise very seriously, that I am 
trying to make us all appreciate the great difficulty and great importance of 
what we do. No matter what it's done for me personally, I don't do it for me 
personally -- I already know the stuff. I do it because I love it, it's great 
fun for me, the last vestige of an old actor, to hold these people for a 
weekend. 
</P>
<P>
"I don't pretend for a moment that this will send a person to the typewriter 
and tell them how to write a story. What they get out of this course is, 
inevitably, a list of questions with knowledge behind them. They can sit down 
with their own material and ask, 'Why doesn't this thing work?' and find the 
answers to those questions. 
</P>
<P>
"They come out with questions and enough knowledge to be able to find their own 
solutions. 
</P>
<P>
"And that's what I do." 
</P>
