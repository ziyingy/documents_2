The City Council on Tuesday adopted the most stringent smoking ordinance in the 
San Gabriel Valley. It will significantly restrict smoking in most public 
buildings and in the workplace. 
</P>
<P>
The ordinance will take effect in 30 days, except in workplaces, where 
employers have an additional 60 days to formulate smoking policies required 
under the ordinance. 
</P>
<P>
It prohibits smoking in elevators, hospitals and health care facilities, public 
meeting places, theaters, auditoriums, public restrooms and service lines. In 
the workplace, smoking is barred in a businesses' common areas and allows 
non-smokers to designate their immediate workplace a non-smoking area. The 
wishes of the non-smoker take precedence in settling disputes. 
</P>
<P>
For restaurants of 50 seats or more, the ordinance requires that 50% of the 
seating be designated for non-smoking. Bars and smaller restaurants are exempt. 
</P>
<P>
The ordinance is modeled after a Pasadena law passed in 1984, but it doubles 
Pasadena's requirement that restricts 25% of a restaurant's seating for 
non-smokers. 
</P>
<P>
Mayor John Hitt offered an amendment to require that smoking sections be 
located in the back of restaurants so non-smokers could avoid walking through 
smoke. Hitt's amendment will be considered in February.
