Few of us are neutral about abortion. Most Americans want abortion to be legal 
and safe. They respect the freedom of a woman to choose whether or not she is 
to bear a child. But most Americans are concerned that we not create an 
abortion culture, that abortion not become just another method of birth 
control. 
</P>
<P>
With 1.5 million abortions each year -- 4,000 a day -- the issue becomes a 
profoundly pastoral one for me. I know children who are now with us because in 
the honest and prayerful struggle with the question of abortion, their mothers 
-- some married, some single -- decided to carry a child to maturity and birth. 
They all have expressed profound gratitude that abortion was a legal and safe 
option. 
</P>
<P>
I know women whose lives were literally saved from unraveling emotionally and 
who were given a chance for healthy, mature living because legal, safe abortion 
was an available choice which they accepted. 
</P>
<P>
As the fierce debate on this unyielding dilemma breaks across the American 
landscape, I want to share some of my convictions and my doubts. We are bound 
together by a community of faith. There is space for struggle, for conflict, 
for exploration, for listening and for loving those who disagree with us. 
</P>
<P>
First, the legal issue. The Supreme Court's landmark ruling on Roe vs. Wade in 
1973 made abortion on demand legal in the early stages of pregnancy and gave 
states the right to protect the potential life of the fetus in later states of 
pregnancy -- or, as the court said, when the fetus is viable, capable of living 
outside the womb. The medical and scientific communities have consistently said 
a fetus is viable no earlier than 24 weeks. 
</P>
<P>
Then on July 3, 1989, a divided Supreme Court opened the way for states to 
limit a woman's access to abortion -- allowed states to place more and more 
limitations on abortion. This decision did, however, stop short of overturning 
the Roe vs. Wade ruling that made the practice of abortion legal in America. 
</P>
<P>
Associate Justice Harry A. Blackmun, author of the 1973 ruling, called the July 
3 decision ominous. He wrote, "I fear for the future. I fear for the liberty 
and equality of millions of women . . . ." He said a woman's fundamental right 
to choose abortion had survived but it wasn't secure. 
</P>
<P>
The July 3 ruling is an attempt to force abortion policy out of the courts and 
into the political arena -- into 50 state legislatures. Associate Justice 
Antonin Scalia wrote that abortion is "a political issue" more than a legal 
one. So from now on state legislators will grapple with ethical, medical and 
legal complexities that even the Supreme Court couldn't solve. Walter 
Dellinger, professor of law at Duke University, said, "Virtually all the power 
in legislatures is held by men who will never be affected by the restrictions 
they impose." Yet their conclusions will have a profound effect upon one of the 
most intimate decisions in a woman's life. 
</P>
<P>
There is a story of three professional people arguing about whose was the first 
profession on Earth. The argument involved a surgeon, an architect and a 
politician. The surgeon said, "I had to be first. The Bible says that out of 
the side of Adam, God took a rib and created Eve. That takes a competent 
surgeon." The architect said, "No, you are wrong. I had to be first because the 
Bible says that out of the chaos God created and fashioned this marvelous 
universe." The politician said, "Oh no. I was first. Who do you think created 
the chaos?" 
</P>
<P>
Politicians in the Missouri Legislature are saying: "The life of a human being 
begins at conception." They will require a test at 20 weeks to determine 
whether the fetus is viable, even with the medical community agreed that all 
evidence says a fetus isn't viable before 24 weeks. 
</P>
<P>
This is playing to the anti-abortionist position that abortions are being done 
very late. Politicians have been convinced that late-term abortions are 
commonplace enough to warrant restrictive legislation. Some anti-abortion 
activists have cleverly created the myth that women have abortions right up to 
the time of delivery for frivolous reasons. The facts are clear and otherwise: 
90% of all abortions are done before the 13th week of pregnancy; fewer than 1% 
of all abortions occur after the 20th week -- and most of those are for urgent 
medical reasons. 
</P>
<P>
Missouri is one of many states that restrict funding for most abortions -- 
leaving poor women and many young teenagers to scrape together enough money to 
terminate unwanted pregnancies. Only New York, California and a few other 
states provide funds for abortion. Now Missouri says no public facilities can 
be used. It hits the poor the hardest; the rate of abortion among women whose 
family annual income is at or below the poverty line is more than double the 
rate for women of the middle class and above. Some states also seek to ban 
abortions from all clinics and require a hospital setting. Now, more than 80% 
of abortions are safely and inexpensively performed in clinics. This hospital 
requirement would quadruple the cost to about $800 -- one more effort to make 
abortion less accessible, especially to the poor. 
</P>
<P>
The Constitution guarantees a woman the right to exercise some control over her 
unique ability to bear children. The high court has now removed portions of 
that control. On the steps of the Supreme Court, Faye Wattleton, president of 
Planned Parenthood, asked rhetorically about these constitutional guarantees: 
"When did it become a political question whether women had reproduction 
rights?" The answer was easy: July 3, 1989. And yet as the late Associate 
Justice Robert H. Jackson said at mid-century, "One's right to life, liberty 
and property . . . depends on the outcome of no election." 
</P>
<P>
Whether pro-choice or anti- abortion, you do not have the right in this 
diverse, pluralistic society to force beliefs and opinions on others. There can 
never be a just law requiring uniformity of behavior on the abortion issue. 
</P>
<P>
From my perspective that is what the Roman Catholic Church and the religious 
right attempt to do on abortion. The late Cardinal Cushing of Boston once said, 
referring to the birth-control controversy: "Catholics do not need the support 
of civil law to be faithful to their religious convictions, and they do not 
seek to impose by law their moral view on other members of society." May his 
spirit prevail. 
</P>
<P>
Many of us have deep religious feelings about abortion, about the moral quality 
of the individual decision involved; but I believe it is critical to 
distinguish how I might judge the act of abortion morally and what I believe a 
societywide policy on abortion should be. Whatever my views, the woman must be 
the moral agent in that decision. 
</P>
<P>
The moral issue is the sanctity of life. The reason debate is so acrimonious is 
that both sides share the ethical principle of respect for life. But the 
sanctity of life doesn't end debate for we must deal with two sanctities -- 
fetus and mother. 
</P>
<P>
Let me state two extremes of the debate. Anti-abortion forces are declaring 
more and more that human personhood begins at conception -- then aborting a 
fetus is, to them, no more acceptable than any other form of murder. Randall 
Terry's group, Operation Rescue, met last month for a rally at the First 
Nazarene Church in Pasadena. Rescue members are committed to closing down 
abortion clinics. Terry, who has been arrested in city after city, continues to 
push his cause with increased vigor. He says, "We're calling on thousands of 
pro-life Americans to peacefully blockade these killing centers with their 
bodies to prevent children from dying, and we will launch an equal force 
against state legislatures to chip away at the Roe decision legalizing 
abortion." 
</P>
<P>
At the other extreme, some pro-choice forces feel a fetus is a mass of 
dependent protoplasm to be extracted without regret. Abortion is merely the 
flushing away of a mass of tissue. 
</P>
<P>
Both extremes fall short. 
</P>
<P>
When does human life begin? When is there a living human person? That is not a 
biological fact to be discerned; it is a theological perception. To say the 
fetus is not alive, not a living reality, is absurd. From the moment of 
conception it is a growing life. But to say at the moment of conception there 
is a human person is equally absurd. 
</P>
<P>
I believe there is life at conception, life at a special time in its 
development -- part of a continuum that begins in the uterus, emerges as a 
human being at birth, passes through childhood, adolescence and adulthood and 
ends in death. The fertilized egg is human in origin and destiny. It is growing 
and has the potential of human personhood -- though it cannot be called a human 
person at that early moment. 
</P>
<P>
Such a distinction is basic even to conservative theologians like Dr. John R.W. 
Stott, who comments that the decision to abort for reasons of a mother's health 
involves a choice "between an actual human being and a potential human being." 
</P>
<P>
Anti-abortion people want to erase all distinction between potential life and 
actual life. 
</P>
<P>
For many women, abortion is one of the most important decisions they ever make. 
Two ethical concerns about life are present: the sanctity of the potential 
human person and the sanctity of a mother's life -- her moral decision over her 
own body. She struggles with the quality of life she could offer the baby at 
birth, the impact of that birth on the existing web of her other 
responsibilities -- plus her own mental health and well-being. 
</P>
<P>
I am not pro-abortion -- but I am passionately pro-choice. I believe a woman is 
the proper moral agent to determine the use of her body; she should have the 
choice of carrying to maturity her pregnancy. As a theologian I see no way the 
moral status of a fetus can be of greater moral standing than a woman deciding 
her destiny. 
</P>
<P>
It is a question of individual conscience. I refuse to give over the moral 
issue of abortion to a church or the religious right. 
</P>
<P>
Before 1973, American women often chose to risk their own lives rather than 
have an extra child that could destroy the family's ability to cope or would 
cause an unmanageable crisis in family life. Some ghastly practices were used 
when surgical, safe abortions were not available. 
</P>
<P>
The radical nature of methods once resorted to speaks of the desperation 
involved in unwanted pregnancy. There is something vicious and violent about 
coercing a woman to carry to term an unwanted child. To force the unwanted on 
the unwilling, to use a woman's body against her will and choice, is a kind of 
legalized rape that is morally repugnant. 
</P>
<P>
The growing restrictions that state after state will place on abortion, in many 
instances recriminalizing it, will not reduce the instances of abortion. Women 
will continue to put their lives at risk to terminate unwanted pregnancy. New 
restrictions will only put poor women in a more desperate place and leave all 
women who have taken this risk more mentally scarred for life. I cannot believe 
such action reflects a moral society. 
</P>
<P>
Is there a way out? As a priest and as an ethicist, I want to be counted as 
pro-choice, keeping abortion legal, safe and available to all. But I seek a 
society in which abortion is less and less necessary, so count me among those 
who favor public policies that will reduce the number of abortions without 
coercing women. The only way that is possible is to create a different kind of 
nation. 
</P>
<P>
 -- The society we seek must have as its primary agenda the rights of the born, 
the improved quality of life for those who come into this marvelous world -- 
adequate care and protection from the first stirrings to the final groans. My 
grievance is severe with so many anti-abortion advocates who demand justice for 
the unborn but who also advocate dismantling social programs that provide a 
decent life for children once they enter the world. 
</P>
<P>
If we are to reduce abortions, we must reaffirm by work and action the rights 
of the born. 
</P>
<P>
 -- The society we seek doesn't flaunt and exploit sex at every turn. Vast 
numbers of adults today participate in the devaluing of human sexuality by 
separating sex from love and commitment. 
</P>
<P>
 -- The society we seek is one where greater scientific effort goes into 
developing safer and more reliable birth control, along with a commitment to 
have this contraceptive information and these contraceptives available to all 
people. Today 50% of all teen-agers are sexually active. I believe that reality 
is a very unhealthy phenomenon in our culture. Only 33% of teen-agers use any 
birth control method consistently; 25% of all abortions are among the teen-age 
population. Condoms prevent pregnancy and protect against the AIDS virus. It's 
immoral not to act with urgency in getting contraceptives to teenagers who are 
sexually active. 
</P>
<P>
 -- The society we seek says all life is sacred everywhere, for if it is cheap 
anywhere, it is cheap everywhere. 
</P>
<P>
Only as we see every human being across this planet as a sacred person to be 
cherished -- only then will we see a society emerge in which abortion is less 
and less a necessary option. 
</P>
<P>
So with hearts that feel and brains that think, let us continue to walk as 
disciples of the Christ. And for me, at this moment in time, that means to join 
my life in solidarity with women who claim the moral responsibility over their 
own bodies. May God direct our efforts and illuminate our path. 
</P>
<P>
Amen. 
</P>
