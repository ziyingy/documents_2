The investigation of gambling allegations involving Cincinnati Reds Manager 
Pete Rose has expanded into a multi-state inquiry into sports betting linked to 
organized crime, a newspaper reported today.

The Dayton Daily News in a copyrighted story said a source close to the inquiry 
said investigators are looking into allegations of substantial debts Rose may 
owe to bookmakers with alleged ties to organized crime. The newspaper did not 
identify its source.

The widening investigation of Rose's alleged gambling will delay any action by 
Commissioner Peter Ueberroth until at least next week, the newspaper quoted a 
source in the commissioner's office as saying. The source said, "With all the 
additional information coming in, the investigation has become far-reaching," 
the newspaper reported.
