Excavation up to 14 feet deep will occur in the most heavily contaminated area, 
which measures about 150 feet by 200 feet, Hirsch said. The contractor, O.H. 
Materials Corp., will replace the contaminated material with fresh soil.

Chatham Brothers, located southwest of the corner of Gamble Lane and Bernardo 
Avenue, was identified in 1981 as a toxic waste site by county and state health 
officials.
