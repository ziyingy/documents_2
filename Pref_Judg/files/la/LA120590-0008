Mathabane takes to task the Encyclopedia Britannica for not including black 
authors among its "Great Books of the Western World." 
</P>
<P>
The reason for this is straightforward. 
</P>
<P>
Black writers have written predominantly about the experience of being black. 
That puts them in a category with Philip Roth and Leon Uris, who have written 
about the experience of being Jewish, and Betty Friedan who has written about 
the experience of being a woman. Roth, Uris and Friedan are also not in the 
"Great Books." 
</P>
<P>
Obviously, these are very good writers and authors. But a key criterion for 
admission to the "Great Books" series is "universality." And that means 
something more than an author writing about his or her own community, however 
adroitly. 
</P>
<P>
At its base, then, Mathabane is simply one more voice calling for quotas, 
race-based preference and the like.
