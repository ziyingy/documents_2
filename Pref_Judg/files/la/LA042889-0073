A spring snowstorm swept across the Rockies, dumping up to eight inches of 
heavy, wet snow in Montana, while winds and new snow created near blizzard 
conditions in parts of Wyoming. Heavy snow warnings were posted through today 
over the northern mountains of Wyoming, with up to a foot of snowfall expected 
by late today in the Laramie Range. Near Cheyenne, Wyo., about six inches of 
new snow combined with strong and gusty winds to create near blizzard 
conditions. In south-central Montana, eight inches of snow fell on Red Lodge, a 
ski resort community. Great Falls, Cut Bank, Helena, Butte, Bozeman and 
Livingston all had accumulations of two to four inches.
