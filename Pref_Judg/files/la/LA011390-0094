Dale Ellis of the Seattle SuperSonics suffered three broken ribs and a 
collapsed lung when his car hit a highway barrier Friday. He was arrested on 
suspicion of drunk driving. 
</P>
<P>
Ellis, 29, an all-star guard, was in satisfactory condition at Harborview 
Medical Center, according to spokeswoman Pam Round. 
</P>
<P>
Authorities gave this account of the accident: Ellis' 1989 Mercedes-Benz struck 
a barrier in a "Y" that splits the road into express and local traffic lanes. 
</P>
<P>
The car then careened across a lane and struck a movable arm that controls 
access to the express lanes. The passenger side of the black, two-door sedan 
was heavily damaged. 
</P>
<P>
Ellis was not taken into police custody after the 2 a.m. accident but was 
transported directly to Harborview. 
</P>
<P>
Ellis was offered a blood-alcohol test at Harborview, but Washington State 
Police declined to say whether Ellis took the test. 
</P>
<P>
"My only concern and thoughts are that Dale Ellis recovers," said Bernie 
Bickerstaff, SuperSonic coach. 
</P>
<P>
"Basketball becomes secondary in this situation. We were down there last night 
with him . . . for most of the night. He'll do all right," he said. 
</P>
<P>
SuperSonic President Bob Whitsitt said Ellis was expected to recover fully. 
</P>

Ellis, the team's leading scorer this season, had 29 points Thursday in the 
SuperSonics' 98-87 victory over the Dallas Mavericks at the Seattle Coliseum. 
He was averaging 23 points, 15th best in the NBA. 
</P>
<P>
Police records show Ellis has been cited for moving violations nine times in 
King County during the past three years. Those citations include five for 
speeding, a driving history that county Deputy Prosecutor Mark Larson said 
might worsen Ellis' penalty if he is convicted. 
</P>

For first-time offenders in Washington, driving while intoxicated carries a 
maximum penalty of one year in jail and a $1,000 fine. The mandatory minimum 
sentence is one day in jail, $250 in fines, $150 in court costs and revocation 
of driving privileges for 90 days. 
</P>
<P>
Ellis' case is not expected to come up in court for at least two months, Larson 
said. 
</P>
<P>
In 1987, Ellis crashed a BMW into an interstate divider and abandoned the car. 
The car was a loaner from an auto-repair company that was working on his 
Jaguar. Ellis reportedly blamed the accident on the BMW's steering.
