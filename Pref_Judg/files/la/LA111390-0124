To local dentist Madrid Uso, the small patch of hilltop soil he tends with his 
wife, Jenny, means more than the cabbage, broccoli and cauliflower they will 
harvest. 
</P>
<P>
"This is good therapy," Uso said. 
</P>
<P>
It's a concept not lost on Harry Otsubo, for whom the 2 1/2-acre Harry Otsubo 
Gardens is named. Otsubo, 76, owner of the Dana Point Nursery, has been 
gardening and farming all his life. But, like the Usos, he wanted his own plot 
on the hillside overlooking Dana Point Harbor. 
</P>
<P>
"People love nature, whether it's animals or vegetables," Otsubo said. "There's 
something fascinating about things growing. I think that's what keeps a farmer 
going. He actually sees something that's the result of his work, and can watch 
it grow." 
</P>
<P>
At the gardens, people may lease any one of 48 plots of heretofore expensive 
Dana Point soil, either 10 feet by 20 or 20 feet square, for $10 or $20 a year, 
respectively. 
</P>
<P>
What they use the plot for is up to the gardener. 
</P>
<P>
"These are cool season vegetables," said Jenny Uso, pointing to some baby 
seedlings poking through the soil. "After Christmas, we plan to try some 
strawberries." 
</P>
<P>
On her parcel, Michele Cuevas has planted lettuce, Brussels sprouts and various 
herbs. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm hoping I won't have to buy any at the store," said Cuevas, who tends her 
plot daily with her two daughters, Brooke and Bridget. Michele is Otsubo's 
granddaughter.

The idea for the Harry Otsubo Gardens evolved out of hours of discussion by the 
board of directors of the Capistrano Bay Park and Recreation District, said 
Lynn Muir, a board member and local architect. The acreage was deeded to the 
park district by the developer of the Searidge condominium project across 
Street of the Golden Lantern in exchange for the right to build. The gardens 
opened this fall, and already all but a few plots are taken. 
</P>
<P>
"At first we weren't sure what to do with it, but we finally decided that 
rather than just have it sit there, why not let people have a garden for 
themselves," Muir said. 
</P>
<P>
It was patterned after similar projects in Leisure World, Fullerton and the 
"Victory Garden" television program, Muir said. 
</P>
<P>
"We figured there was a school (Dana Hills High School) right across the 
street, so there was already a place for people to play nearby," said Otsubo, 
another district board member. 
</P>
<P>
The rocky soil was rototilled and fertilized by the district, which also 
provides water. But Otsubo, with decades of experience, suggests that may not 
be enough. 
</P>
<P>
"The hardest part is getting started," he said. "You need to work the soil and 
add mulch and fertilizer. I always tell people it's like a cake, you can put 
all the ingredients together, but if you don't blend them right, they won't 
work for you." LEN HALL
