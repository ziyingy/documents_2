Los Angeles County animal control officers removed more than 150 dogs and cats 
Wednesday night from a house in a rural Lancaster neighborhood after a woman 
trying to return a lost dog to its owner reported "atrocious conditions" there.

Animal Control Officer Alex Flores said Roger Wooten, owner of the Bar Mae 
Kennel, located in the 3200 block of West Avenue N, would be cited for cruelty 
to animals.

More than 153 dogs and cats of various breeds were removed from the chain-link 
runs behind Wooten's house, Flores said. He said he believed most of the 
animals belonged to Wooten.

Officials were alerted to the problem by a woman who had advertised in a local 
paper to find the owner of a lost dog that she found. After receiving a call, 
she went to the kennel to return the dog, and saw animals in crowded and 
unsanitary conditions, Flores said.

Flores said the animals' health would be checked and they would be taken to 
county animal shelters.
