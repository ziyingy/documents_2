officials said Monday.

"RTD is proud to be a leader in the field of testing alternative fuels as a

The first of the new $164,000, 40-foot coaches was unveiled Monday, along with 
an identifying logo -- a white cross within a circle to denote good health. 
Each bus seats 43 passengers and is equipped with a lift for the disabled.

Methanol, a colorless liquid with a faint alcohol odor, is made from natural 
gas and emits less smoke than diesel fuel. To achieve equivalent horsepower, 
however, twice as much methanol must be burned as diesel. RTD is buying 
methanol for 53 cents a gallon under a special program with the state.
