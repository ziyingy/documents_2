An Episcopal bishop Saturday ordained the church's first openly homosexual male 
priest in a ceremony marred by only one brief interruption. 
</P>
<P>
Bishop John Spong of Newark quickly brushed off two dissenters before formally 
welcoming J. Robert Williams, leader of the Oasis ministry for homosexual 
Episcopalians, into the priesthood. 
</P>
<P>
Following church protocol, Spong opened the ordination at All Saints Church in 
Hoboken by asking if anyone knew "of any impediment or crime" that should 
prevent Williams from becoming a priest. 
</P>
<P>
When two people spoke up, the bishop talked to them and continued the ceremony. 
He said he had heard their arguments and saw no reason to delay the ordination. 
</P>
<P>
Spong said the new priest had proven himself spiritually, emotionally and 
pastorally, which sparked a burst of applause from the congregation. 
</P>
<P>
Williams is the Episcopal Church's second openly homosexual priest. A lesbian, 
the Rev. Ellen Barret, was ordained in New York in 1977 by Bishop Paul Moore.
