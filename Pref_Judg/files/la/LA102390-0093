Amgen Inc., a Thousand Oaks biotechnology company, said its net income soared 
266% to $14.3 million in the second quarter that ended Sept. 30 from $3.9 
million a year before. Amgen attributed the huge jump to sales of its drug for 
the treatment of chronic anemia in kidney dialysis patients.

Administration in June, 1989. Amgen said its total revenues for the second
