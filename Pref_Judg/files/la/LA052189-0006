<P>
CONSIDER THE WEATHERMAN: clown prince of the evening news, perpetually ribbed 
by jovial anchors for once again failing to predict last Saturday's downpour. 
But there is a new class of weathermen at work today, and their gaze is fixed 
not on next weekend but next century. Theirs is a one-time, 
never-to-be-repeated forecast, not quite yet ready for prime time. 
</P>
<P>
So far, it looks like bad news. But how bad? And how certain? Among themselves, 
the new weathermen are already clearing their throats nervously. Trouble, they 
agree, almost certainly lies ahead. But one problem remains: What, exactly, do 
they tell the rest of us? 
</P>
<P>
The villain is the greenhouse effect, a phenomenon now making headlines that in 
fact has existed for millions of years. And a good thing, too: The greenhouse 
effect is the planet's mantle of gases, primarily carbon dioxide, that traps 
the sun's heat, as do greenhouse windows. Without that insulation, our planet 
would be about 50 degrees cooler, and the Beach Boys would sing about ice 
hockey. 
</P>
<P>
But we may yet curse the greenhouse effect, for humans are gradually increasing 
the heat-trapping gases in the atmosphere by burning coal and oil. At the same 
time, we're destroying the tropical rain forests that in ages past helped 
remove carbon dioxide from the atmosphere through photosynthesis. By increasing 
our insulation, we will probably raise temperatures to record highs. The 
augmented greenhouse effect could unleash floods, droughts, hurricanes, 
famines, runaway weed growth, mass extinctions of animals and plants and the 
generalized end of life-as-we-know-it. All this, moreover, could happen within 
the life span of anyone who can remember "The Brady Bunch." 
</P>
<P>
The disasters haven't started yet. But this exceedingly gradual threat has 
already changed the lives of many researchers who previously toiled in obscure 
scientific pastures. This is a story about five of them -- two who launched the 
greenhouse theory decades ago, and three others who are building careers on the 
concept. All work at Scripps Institution of Oceanography in La Jolla, but their 
disciplines vary -- atmospheric chemist, meteorologist, geophysicist. One 
manipulates imaginary models within computers, another ships bottles of air 
halfway around the world. But all of them are also now weathermen of the 
apocalypse. 
</P>
<P>
RICHARD SOMERVILLE hesitates. As head of Scripps' Climate Research Group, he 
stands at the forefront of international climatology -- weather on the grand 
scale. A visitor has just asked what seems a simple question: Is greenhouse 
warming already changing our weather? Somerville is momentarily gazing out the 
window. Tan and fit in his mid-40s, he has a mildly aristocratic air and a 
corner office that overlooks an expanse of beach. On this spring morning, the 
fog has lifted and the Pacific is an ideal shimmering blue, dotted with 
surfers, a few of them Scripps researchers. This is a campus replete with wet 
suits, surfboards and offices with towel-bars. But it's no party school: 
Scripps, officially part of UC San Diego, was instrumental in turning 
oceanography, once a rich man's hobby, into an accepted science. Scripps was 
also the birthplace of the greenhouse warming theory. 
</P>
<P>
Today, along with half a dozen other institutions, including MIT and Columbia 
University, Scripps is on the leading edge of trying to predict just what may 
lie ahead. "Let me put it this way," Somerville says finally. "There's no 
disagreement in the scientific community: The greenhouse effect is a problem. 
We differ on the warming we expect, how quickly it will occur and how it will 
be distributed over the earth. But there's remarkable unanimity that it's a 
very, very real problem." 
</P>
<P>
A brief sampler of worst-case scenarios: If global temperatures indeed rise 
during the next few decades and polar icecaps begin to melt, by 2050 ocean 
levels could threaten the homes of 40 million coastal residents worldwide. 
Manhattan might require levees to hold back the tides; Malibu would be a 
disaster zone. Persistent drought would cripple the corn and wheat belts of the 
United States. Chicago would overlook acres of mud that had once been Lake 
Michigan. Northern California would suffer severe spring floods and summer 
parching. As the Colorado River basin dried, Los Angeles would find its water 
supply cut by half. 
</P>
<P>
Somerville doesn't like to talk about global disaster. He was trained as a 
traditional meteorologist, specializing in weather prediction: showers on 
Thursday, clear for the weekend. "But," he says, "my interest just grew, from 
tomorrow's weather, to next week's, to the next season's climate, to the 
decades-long scale of the greenhouse effect." 
</P>
<P>
Now Somerville oversees a research group totaling 25 people, a clutch of costly 
computers and joint projects that involve laboratories from Los Alamos to 
Hamburg. The Climate Research Group studies topics ranging from next winter's 
precipitation to predicting the onset of the Indian monsoon. "Climate," 
Somerville says, "is the sum total of weather. For me, the dividing line is 
around a few weeks -- that turns out to be the scientific limit on how far one 
can hope to predict the weather in a specific place." 
</P>
<P>
Increasingly, Scripps researchers gaze into the next century. They are trying 
to answer two fundamental questions. One is about the greenhouse effect itself: 
How did carbon dioxide cycle through the oceans, green plants and living 
organisms during the eons before humans started burning coal and oil? The 
second, broader question: How will increasing global temperatures affect our 
climate? This second question requires some notion of how the vast machine of 
planetary weather works to begin with. Not for the first time, humans are 
desperately trying to understand natural phenomena even as we are in the midst 
of altering them. 
</P>
<P>
Today, a single copy of the Journal of Atmospheric Sciences is as thick as a 
year's worth of issues from 1962, when Somerville started his work. But each 
year of science seems to produce as many new uncertainties as answers. For 
example, it's an accepted scientific notion that weather comes from the 
interaction of the atmosphere and the oceans. But the finer details of how air 
and sea interact remain mysterious, and that is why researchers such as 
Somerville pull back from specifics about the greenhouse effect. 
</P>
<P>
"There are lots of feedback loops in the climate," he says, "each like a 
thermostat in your house. As our climate gets warmer, they'll come on. They may 
turn on the air conditioner, which is good. But they may turn on the furnace, 
and warm it up even more. And there are a lot of these thermostats, all 
connected to a lot of air conditioners and furnaces. And some thermostats even 
seem to be connected to other thermostats." 
</P>
<P>
Somerville specializes in one thermostat: clouds. As the climate warms, more 
moisture will evaporate from the oceans, and the earth will grow more cloudy. 
But will the clouds reflect solar energy away from the planet and act as an air 
conditioner? Or will the additional water molecules in the atmosphere trap more 
infrared radiation -- behaving like a furnace? No one knows. "Society rightly 
wants to know answers about the greenhouse effect," Somerville says, "but 
sometimes science isn't in the position to provide them. When a congressman 
asks, 'What will the weather be like in my district in the 21st Century?' we 
can't yet give an answer to rely on." 
</P>
<P>
When can he expect one? Somerville hesitates. "With new satellite data and 
faster computers, the uncertainty will decrease. But if we don't understand how 
the climate works in the first place, the fastest computer in the world will 
just be solving erroneous equations more quickly." 
</P>
<P>
ROGER REVELLE knows what it is to overturn erroneous equations. Revelle, 80, 
director emeritus of Scripps and scion of an influential San Diego family, is 
probably the most formally dressed fellow on campus, clad in gray flannel 
slacks and a blue blazer. Revelle is also, for practical purposes, the father 
of the greenhouse warming theory. 
</P>
<P>
Revelle wasn't the first to ponder the topic. Just before the turn of the 
century, Swedish scientist Svante Arrhenius (whose grandson now teaches at 
Scripps) theorized that human activities might add to the natural greenhouse 
effect. But at the time, scientists believed that the oceans could absorb as 
much carbon dioxide as our factories and fireplaces could pump out. Microscopic 
organisms at the sea's surface absorb carbon dioxide as they grow, then die and 
sink miles to the bottom, where the carbon sits for centuries. 
</P>
<P>
Even so, in the mid-1930s, a mild global warming trend was under way, and an 
English scientist named G. S. Callendar warned that greenhouse warming might be 
possible. But then a spell of cold winters ensued, scientists dropped the topic 
and the world happily went about pumping additional billions of tons of CO2into 
the atmosphere for two more decades. 
</P>
<P>
In 1957, Revelle and Hans Suess, another Scripps researcher, sounded a caution 
that the ocean wasn't going to bail us out: Only about half of the carbon 
dioxide gets the deep six. In their paper, they observed dryly that, in putting 
back into the atmosphere much of the carbon now stored in such fossil fuels as 
oil and coal, "mankind in spite of itself is conducting a great one-time 
geophysical experiment." Says Revelle: "It did not occur to me that we'd really 
have a serious climatic change. I'm not a prophet. I was a scientist and 
thought we'd learn a lot from it." 
</P>
<P>
"Dr. Revelle," Time magazine said, "has not reached the stage of warning 
against this catastrophe, but he and other geophysicists intend to keep 
watching and recording." 
</P>
<P>
As it turned out, someone was already watching: a young Caltech post-doctoral 
student named Charles Keeling, who had seized upon the then-thorny problem of 
measuring the amount of CO2 in the atmosphere. Thorny because, according to 
conventional wisdom, CO2concentrations varied widely, depending on when and 
where you took a sample. Keeling, however, was the first to monitor CO2levels 
over a sustained period. In taking measurements from Corona del Mar to the 
White Mountains near Death Valley, he discovered something surprising: The 
amount of carbon dioxide in the atmosphere is really quite constant from one 
place to another. 
</P>
<P>
It was a propitious time for global curiosity. The 1957 International 
Geophysical Year was under way, an ambitious, well-financed international 
effort to learn more about the basics of the planet. Revelle, already 
influential in national science, lobbied hard for the IGY to include 
CO2monitoring and, moreover, helped put the unknown Keeling in charge. Keeling 
set up monitoring stations atop Mauna Loa in Hawaii and at the South Pole, 
choosing locations far from any sources of man-made CO2. He found that even at 
those remote spots, the CO2concentration was very similar to that of 
California's. 
</P>
<P>
Within three years, Keeling's figures would reveal ominous news: The amount of 
CO2in the atmosphere was rising, precisely as feared. Revelle's 1957 warning 
proved correct: The oceans absorb only half the CO2that human activities churn 
out. The "Keeling curve," the smoking gun of the greenhouse effect, is now a 
classic chart in atmospheric chemistry: an undulating but gradually ascending 
line that begins in 1957 and climbs unabated to this day. The fluctuations 
reflect the life cycle of plants in the Northern Hemisphere -- absorbing carbon 
dioxide in the spring, releasing it as they decay in the fall. But the 
relentless ascent is entirely man-made. 
</P>
<P>
The implications are profound. Revelle pulls out a graph that displays average 
global temperatures during the past million years. "The entire temperature 
range from an ice age to the warmest interglacial period is about four degrees. 
That's just about the best estimate for the greenhouse-effect increase also." 
Right now, the earth is in an interglacial period -- it's as warm as it ever 
gets on this planet. When another few degrees are added during the next 50 
years, Revelle says softly, "we're moving the climate into uncharted 
territory." 
</P>
<P>
CHARLES KEELING, a slender, unassuming man of 61, still works in the same small 
laboratory where, three decades ago, he confirmed the encroaching greenhouse 
effect. The laboratory looks its age, with racks of handblown glassware and 
cabinets finished in yellowing oak. Out in the hallway are big wooden shipping 
crates packed with air samples freighted in from sampling stations around the 
globe. "Grab samples," they're called, air captured by hand in glass globes 
slightly smaller than soccer balls, often wrapped in surgical tape. Keeling's 
assistants carefully siphon each globe's contents through an elaborate tracery 
of glass, determining -- in parts per million -- just how much carbon dioxide 
each sample contains. 
</P>
<P>
"The rate of rise," Keeling says, "has actually accelerated during the past 10 
years over what we expected." It may be that increased deforestation of the 
Amazon is already changing the planet's ability to absorb CO2. Or else warming 
in the far north latitudes is melting permafrost, releasing CO2into the 
atmosphere. 
</P>
<P>
The Keeling curve is now accepted by scientists worldwide. Yet the rise in 
CO2hasn't yet translated itself into a similarly ascending chart of 
temperatures, and that has caused no end of scientific debate. In all 
probability, the complex interactions of atmosphere and ocean, combined with 
the centuries-long natural temperature fluctuation, so far have masked the 
added heating. "Temperature is so variable," Keeling says. "Europe just had a 
very warm winter, the Pacific Northwest had a cold winter. You can't blame them 
both on the greenhouse effect, although the Europeans are suspicious." 
</P>
<P>
Last summer's Midwestern drought probably wasn't caused by the greenhouse 
effect either, any more than was the Dust Bowl of the '30s. In Keeling's view, 
serious droughts may be more likely these days because of greenhouse warming, 
but he hesitates to say more. Another Scripps researcher puts it this way: Last 
year's drought, a century ago, might have ended a few days sooner. 
</P>
<P>
Last June, in the midst of the drought, a NASA researcher named James Hansen 
made headlines when he told Congress that he was "99%" certain that greenhouse 
warming had already started. And earlier this month, Hansen told the media that 
the administration had softened additional testimony he was planning to give on 
imminent greenhouse dangers. 
</P>
<P>
For researchers such as Keeling, the public interest caused by Hansen's bold 
statements is encouraging. Early this year, the Bush Administration announced 
increased funding for greenhouse effect studies. But beneath the temporary 
boost lies a deeper fear: What happens when it gets cold again? 
</P>
<P>
Hansen's second move into the limelight already showed the administration's 
reluctance to believe that the worst could happen. And although this decade has 
seen the six warmest years of the past century, with 1987 and 1988 the hottest 
of those, Keeling says that in all likelihood, the world's climate will get 
colder again in the 1990s, perhaps even setting new records for chill winters. 
</P>
<P>
"We'll have to wait about 20 years," he says, "and then we'll break heat 
records again. The 2010s will be even hotter that the 1980s. There will be 
another whole set of discussions about the greenhouse effect -- and then it 
might get cold again. But then, the next time around, by 2040 or so, the 
greenhouse effect will be upon us again -- in spades." 
</P>
<P>
DAVID ERICKSON, heavy-set, cheerful, looks like a guy with whom you could have 
a few beers and shoot some pool. But at the moment, he's communing with a 
computer terminal, logged on long-distance to a Cray supercomputer somewhere in 
the mountains of Colorado. 
</P>
<P>
Erickson, 28, is of the generation of scientists who will make their 
reputations on the greenhouse effect. Growing up in Rochester, N.Y., he never 
saw the sea until he was 12; then he became fascinated with the ocean and 
atmosphere. His degree is in atmospheric chemistry; ironically, now that he's 
at oceanographers' heaven, he rarely ventures out on research vessels to sample 
the atmosphere. Instead, he captains supercomputers -- the multimillion-dollar 
machines that are the fastest computers on the planet. "I've never been without 
a Cray," he says. He now has accounts on six state-of-the-art supercomputers 
spread across the country. That points up a profound change in the field: When 
Erickson's boss, Richard Somerville, wrote his thesis 25 years ago, he 
struggled to find a few hours on a "supercomputer" less powerful than the Apple 
Macintosh on which he now writes letters. 
</P>
<P>
Erickson's specialty represents the future of weather research: He uses 
supercomputers to run immense mathematical models that simulate the earth's 
weather system. A model is an elaborate computer program, often written by 
several hundred people. The computer code is meant to represent realistically 
the incredibly complex interaction of winds, clouds, temperature, solar 
radiation, ocean cooling and the hundreds of other variables that influence we 
The goal: to create an accurate model of current earth climate, then double the 
COc,6 2 level, sit back and see what happens to the weather in, say, Wichita. 
</P>
<P>
But that's easier said than done. If the half a dozen giant weather models 
currently floating around the planet's computer networks have anything in 
common, it is that they aren't very good at modeling the weather. "Some people 
in New York do the solar radiation," Erickson says. "Some other group does the 
clouds, and these people maybe meet each other once a year." 
</P>
<P>
Erickson is one of the few researchers in the country now testing the most 
recent model from the National Center for Atmospheric Research. He's asking the 
computer to predict wind speeds in a particular section of the Pacific Ocean, 
over a "month" that belongs in a Ray Bradbury short story : "perpetual July," a 
mathematical construct made up of nothing but 1,000 July days. Once the 
computer has predicted the wind speeds for perpetual July, Erickson will 
compare the results to Scripps' own records -- 300,000 observations of real 
wind speeds during July. "Data from people on boats," he explains. "Captains 
staring out at sea." 
</P>
<P>
In all likelihood, the model won't match the real numbers, Erickson will write 
a paper describing the discrepancies, and the modelers will make repairs. 
Someday Erickson may write his own model. More likely, he will be part of a 
team that creates a huge model representing both oceans and atmosphere, acting 
together, just as in life -- a model so complex that it will run on half a 
dozen supercomputers, all at once. Such a model could provide the first real 
answers about weather half a century hence -- but will probably not exist until 
well into the next decade. 
</P>
<P>
Today, there's a bit of a setback: The Cray in Colorado has rejected Erickson's 
code because of some small error in the program. He shrugs with the 
imperturbability of someone who doesn't mind hacking in FORTRAN and the obscure 
Cray operating system. "It could just be a period in the wrong place. These 
models are so massive, you can't really understand everything that's going on." 
</P>
<P>
ALL WEATHERMEN of the apocalypse understand one aspect of their studies: money. 
Who will fund the long-term research that the greenhouse effect demands? 
Private industry may grow more interested in the topic. After last summer's 
drought dropped the Mississippi River 20 feet and halted barge traffic, a major 
Illinois grain firm invested $36 million in a railroad that parallels the river 
-- for if there is greenhouse warming, the Mississippi might no longer serve to 
ship grain to market. In the Northwest, Weyerhaeuser is already planting 
drought-resistant saplings for harvest in 30 to 60 years. And insurance 
companies -- for whom 40% of casualty and property losses are hurricane-related 
-- have launched programs to determine whether warming might lengthen the 
hurricane season. 
</P>
<P>
But industry funding usually goes toward specific predictions. For the big 
picture, researchers must still rely on the federal government. "There are 
hopeful sounds coming out of Washington," Somerville says, "but we're only 
beginning to see the glimmering of real dollars." 
</P>
<P>
The 1990 federal budget proposes $190.5 million for research into the 
greenhouse effect. Unfortunately, that sum is divided among nine federal 
agencies. "It's becoming popular to have these enormous global studies 
programs," says another Scripps researcher. "But sometimes it turns out that 
the amount of energy that goes into the planning is more than the amount that 
actually turns into work." 
</P>
<P>
Keeling is even less optimistic. When he set out to measure CO2on Mauna Loa in 
1957, "it was a time that young scientists could try something out. I suspect 
very much that I wouldn't have succeeded today, because I had only my own data 
telling me I was right." Keeling's own funding is now in doubt, since the 
National Science Foundation isn't enthusiastic about sustaining long-term 
monitoring programs. "They like new discoveries," Keeling says. 
</P>
<P>
In addition, these days, grant money more often goes for computer simulations 
than field research. It can cost $13,000 a day to take a ship out and sample 
CO2in the open ocean; it's far cheaper to let researchers sit at computers. 
Ironically, Keeling's son, a recent Harvard Ph.D., had to scramble for dollars 
to conduct a new kind of atmospheric analysis as speculative as his father 
performed 30 years ago. "Students today," says the elder Keeling, "learn very 
quickly that a career in this area isn't necessarily going to be a comfortable 
life style." But for some younger researchers, the motivation is no longer 
simply scientific curiosity or a stimulating job. "Not to sound corny about 
it," Somerville says, "but we're starting to see students with deeply held 
convictions about doing research that leaves the world a better place." 
</P>
<P>
There is, for example, Justin Lancaster, who, in his mid-30s, is athletic, 
outgoing and looks every bit the ski-racer he was as an undergraduate. A 
Vermont native, he was practicing environmental law when he realized that there 
were bigger fish to fry. "I saw my friends pursuing issues that just weren't 
that important. I wanted to know, 'What's really important?' " In 1980, he rode 
his bicycle from Vermont to San Diego and presented himself at Scripps. With 
little background in science, he was told he'd never get in the front door. 
</P>
<P>
"Where's the back door?" he asked. 
</P>
<P>
Within a few months, he was a volunteer in Charles Keeling's laboratory. His 
first job was to carry the big glass bottles out to the end of the Scripps 
pier, where he stood into the wind, held his breath to keep from adding his own 
carbon dioxide to the sample, removed the stopper and let the local air rush 
in. At the same time, he completed his undergraduate science requirements. 
</P>
<P>
Now Lancaster is within months of earning his doctorate in oceanography. His 
work uses the newest technology -- satellite photographs that give a truly 
global perspective -- to answer a basic question: Just how much carbon dioxide 
do plants and soils use, and is this affected by changing temperatures and 
rainfall? Armed with both doctorate and law degree, Lancaster plans to return 
to public-policy issues. He foresees a day when governments and multinational 
corporations will need experts versed in science -- from acid rain to the 
greenhouse effect -- and who are also willing to write prescriptions for 
planetary recovery, ranging from local restrictions on automobile fuel economy 
to international treaties about the use of coal and oil. 
</P>
<P>
The need looms ever larger. In March, NASA released a shocking photograph from 
last September's Discovery shuttle mission. It showed a dense white smoke 
cloud, 1 million miles square, covering the Amazon basin -- suggesting that the 
extent of forest burning there has been greatly underestimated. Regardless of 
what the United States does, in fact, most of the future greenhouse gases will 
emanate from developing nations, which will inevitably use coal and oil in 
their attempt to match Western living standards. Indeed, two-thirds of the 
world's coal remains in China and the Soviet Union -- which are almost certain 
to burn it. Some cynics point out that the Soviet Union is one nation that 
might gain from a warmer climate. 
</P>
<P>
Lancaster is surprisingly optimistic about a career that deals so directly with 
doom. He shrugs. "I was just down at Torrey Pines High School for career day. 
My career was supposed to be saving Mother Earth. And a lot of the students 
sounded pretty pessimistic. But my response was, sure, you can find plenty to 
be pessimistic about. Evolution is change, and change is easy to regret. We're 
losing wilderness. We're losing dirt roads with grass shoulders. We're moving 
to an engineered surface of the earth. If you can't accept that, then you're 
stuck in pessimism. But I'm optimistic about technology being able to give us 
clean air; about governments firming up wilderness protection. I accept 
change." 
</P>
<P>
At that moment, Lancaster sounds strikingly like Roger Revelle, half a century 
his senior, architect of the greenhouse warming theory. "Global change isn't 
something to avoid," Revelle had said earlier that day in his gentle baritone. 
"It's something to recognize and keep from happening too fast. Human beings can 
adapt to anything, if we just have enough time. But almost certainly, some of 
the things we adapt to will shock us." 
</P>
<P>
And Revelle smiled, with the calm that can only come from gazing at the very 
big picture. 
</P>
