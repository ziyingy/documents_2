State prosecutors Friday rejected as a "fanciful fabrication" new defense 
claims that authorities enticed a former cellmate to lie when he testified 
against condemned killer Robert Alton Harris in his 1979 trial. 
</P>
<P>
Lawyers for the state attorney general's office urged the U.S. 9th Circuit 
Court of Appeals to refuse a key bid by Harris to avoid becoming the first to 
die in the gas chamber in California since 1967. 
</P>
<P>
The state lawyers said the defense claims came too late in the 12-year-old San 
Diego case -- and that new statements by a jailhouse informant charging that he 
was coached to commit perjury at the trial contained "bald-faced lies." 
</P>
<P>
Even if the new charges were true, the attorneys said, they should be 
disregarded in view of the "overwhelming" evidence that Harris deliberately 
killed his two teen-age victims. 
</P>
<P>
"Nothing in these declarations (by the cellmate), even at this late date, 
suggests (Harris) did not commit the murders," the state said in a 28-page 
brief signed by Deputy Attys. Gen. Jay M. Bloom and Louis R. Hanoian. 
</P>
<P>
Defense lawyers are seeking a retrial for Harris in the 1978 murders of John 
Mayeski and Michael Baker, both 16. If he loses in his latest round of appeals, 
he could be executed in the gas chamber next year. 
</P>
<P>
Last week, Harris' attorneys asked the appeals court to order a federal 
district judge to hold a fact-finding hearing on their claims that authorities 
improperly recruited a cellmate to obtain incriminating statements from Harris 
while he was awaiting trial for the killings. 
</P>
<P>
The informant, Joey Dee Abshire, testified at the trial that Harris told him he 
killed the boys to prevent them from identifying him in a robbery. That 
testimony was supported by a sergeant with the San Diego County Sheriff's 
Department, who said he overheard Harris make the admissions to Abshire. Such 
evidence was important in showing that the killings were premeditated -- not 
impulsive -- making Harris eligible for first-degree murder and the death 
penalty. 
</P>
<P>
In an affidavit dated Nov. 7, Abshire claimed authorities persuaded him to 
question Harris, provided him with details of the case, coached him on how to 
testify and then told him to lie about his role as a police agent. Abshire 
stood by his previous testimony that Harris said he killed to avoid 
identification -- but he disputed the deputy's testimony that Harris called the 
youths "punks" he had to "waste." 
</P>
<P>
State prosecutors said a new hearing should be denied "for a myriad of 
reasons." They said the new statements by Abshire and another former cellmate, 
Sonny Arthur Wisdom, lacked credibility coming 12 years after the events at 
issue. Abshire's statements recanting his trial testimony were also 
"convenient," in view of the fact that it is too late now to charge him with 
perjury, the lawyers noted. The state said there was considerable evidence to 
show that officials did not recruit Abshire and coach him.
