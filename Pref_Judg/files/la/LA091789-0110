A four-month project to improve traffic safety at the busy and hazardous 
triangle intersection of Palos Verdes drives West and North in Palos Verdes 
Estates begins this week. Crews are scheduled to work weekdays from 7 a.m. to 
3:30 p.m.

City Planning Director Cathy Reed said traffic will be kept flowing during 
construction along one lane entering the city southbound from Torrance and 
another lane going northbound into Torrance. Delays are possible, however, in 
the intersection that links the peninsula to traffic bound for the beach cities 
and points north.

The $555,206 project is being undertaken to reconfigure two consecutive curves 
in Palos Verdes Drive that have different arcs. The inconsistent curves force 
drivers to readjust their steering wheels. They will be realigned into a single 
continuous curve with the same arc. A median will be added to keep cars from 
crossing into opposing lanes, where there have been head-on collisions.

According to the city, the triangle, which is next to Malaga Cove Plaza and 
carries 32,000 cars a day, was the scene of two traffic fatalities and 71 other 
accidents between 1981 and 1983. The fatalities and the most serious accidents 
occurred on the curves.

A second, $1.9-million phase of the project calls for construction of an 
overpass at the triangle, where the two Palos Verdes drives and Via Chico 
intersect. The bridge will carry northbound traffic headed for Torrance.

Reed said the City Council has approved the bridge concept, but work has not 
been scheduled because the council is reviewing priorities of all capital 
improvement programs. She said the city must also determine the ability of 
earthen ramps to support the bridge.
