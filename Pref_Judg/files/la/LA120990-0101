Plans to broaden the scope of a project to overhaul and expand the Hyperion 
sewage plant have won the endorsement of the Los Angeles Board of Public Works 
despite El Segundo's concerns about the effect on nearby residents.

In a 4-0 vote Wednesday, the board approved an updated plan calling for a 
finished facility capable of providing intensified treatment for 450 million 
gallons of sewage per day.

The original plan contemplates upgraded treatment for 330 million gallons per 
day.

El Segundo says the city of Los Angeles has not adequately considered air 
pollution, noise pollution and other problems the Hyperion expansion might 
cause for residents near the Playa del Rey plant. Los Angeles, it argues, 
should minimize construction at Hyperion by upgrading treatment at other plants 
in its sewage system.

El Segundo has filed a suit against Los Angeles alleging that the plant's 
operations and the expansion work create a public nuisance. City Manager Ron 
Cano said Friday that El Segundo will file a second suit if Los Angeles does 
not respond to its concerns over the updated plan.

But Hyperion engineer Sam Furuta defended the updated plan. "The alternative 
we've selected is the best one in terms of environmental impacts, costs, 
scheduling and everything else, in our opinion," Furuta said Friday.
