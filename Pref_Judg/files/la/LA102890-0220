IN THE EARLY DAYS of our country, quilts weren't only for keeping people warm; 
some also recorded important events or chronicled everyday life. "Wrapped in 
Glory: Figurative Quilts &amp; Bedcovers 1700-1900," at the Los Angeles County 
Museum of Art through Jan. 13, features 32 such creations, including "The 
Suffragette Quilt" (pictured), which illustrates the story of the 
women's-rights movement.

These works differ from floral and abstract quilts of the period: The figures 
are drawn from other images contemporary to the times, such as illustrations in 
ladies magazines. In "The Courting Scenes Bedcover and Shams," says Sandi Fox, 
curator of the exhibition, "the figures present not only the costume but pose 
and movement -- how people stood or worked."
