Virginia Harper, who had cancer, died after swallowing a mixture of pills and 
placing a plastic bag over her head. An autopsy disclosed that she died of 
asphyxiation. Harper admitted in a taped police interview that he tied the bag 
around her neck after she fell into a deep sleep.

Bertram Harper said the family came to Michigan believing that assisted suicide 
was legal in the state, unlike California, where it is a felony.
