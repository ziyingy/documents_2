Off the Channel Islands, John Gonzalez of Malibu struggled for 30 minutes with 
a 45-pound beast his friends called "The Monster Yellowtail." 
</P>
<P>
After finally reeling in the large tuna with an ordinary 20-pound line, he 
posed proudly for photographers. 
</P>
<P>
"This is one of my biggest yellowtail ever," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Gonzalez is among hundreds of commercial and sports fishermen in Ventura County 
who are taking advantage of warmer-than-normal ocean temperatures that attract 
large warm-water yellowtail tuna and white sea bass to the area. 
</P>
<P>
Scientists are unsure why ocean temperatures have increased 5 to 10 degrees 
during the past year, but they are certain that the warmer waters mean big 
business for fishermen. 
</P>
<P>
Fishermen say Gonzalez's trophy is unusual not only because of its size but 
also because yellowtail tuna are usually not seen off the coast at this time of 
year. 
</P>
<P>
"Most people are lucky to catch one in a lifetime," said Jim Launius, captain 
of a sports fishing boat at the Channel Islands Marina. 
</P>
<P>
The change in water temperature also was noted by windsurfers at Surfer's Point 
in Ventura. 
</P>
<P>
"It's pretty warm for this time of year," Tim Koester of Ventura said as he 
stashed his surfboard in his car. 
</P>
<P>
Although most surfers continue to wear wet suits, some have abandoned the 
heavy-duty, full-body suit customary in November. 
</P>
<P>
"My heavy suit is in the trunk," Chang Liampetchakul said as he put on a 
short-sleeved model. 
</P>
<P>
Fishermen, surfers and marine biologists are intrigued and delighted by the 
warmer ocean temperatures, which usually range in the low- to mid-50s in 
November. 
</P>
<P>
Because there is little data or research on ocean temperatures and underwater 
currents, the explanation of the unusual temperatures varies according to whom 
is asked about it. 
</P>
<P>
Dan Richards, a marine biologist at Channel Islands National Park, believes 
that a shift in wind patterns may be the cause. 
</P>
<P>
He suggests that the Southern California coast has experienced a slackening of 
strong winds, which normally blow across the ocean and churn the deeper, colder 
waters. Without the winds, he said, the upper layer of ocean water becomes 
tepid. 
</P>
<P>
"It seems like last winter the wind was mild," he said. 
</P>
<P>
David Siegel, a physical oceanographer at UC Santa Barbara, said the wind 
explanation might be valid. But then again, the warmer temperatures could be 
caused by unusual ocean currents or a complicated combination of warm and cold 
air pressures off the coast. 
</P>
<P>
"It's an infant science," Siegel said. "What is happening today? Who knows." 
</P>
<P>
Ed Lusk, a wholesale commercial fishermen at the Ventura harbor, doesn't really 
care. Lusk is too busy keeping an eye on an increase in the shrimp population. 
</P>
<P>
"They are not bigger, we are just seeing more juvenile shrimp, which is a good 
sign for business for years to come," he said. 
</P>
<P>
He said he believes that warmer waters are forcing a cold-water fish that preys 
on shrimp to migrate out of the area. 
</P>
<P>
"That means that a lot more of the baby shrimp survive," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Launius, who has been a captain of a sport fishing boat for 13 years, said the 
abundance of fish caught most fishermen by surprise. 
</P>
<P>
On a recent tour, Launius said he was forced to return to dock early because 
all his customers caught their limit of three fish in a few hours. 
</P>
<P>
Most of the yellowtail tuna his customers reeled in where between 25 and 30 
pounds, he said.
