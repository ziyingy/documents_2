The Supreme Court was urged today to permit the withdrawal of life-sustaining 
treatment from a Missouri woman described as "an unconscious shell." But a 
state lawyer said the woman's parents have no constitutional right to order 
such action. 
</P>
<P>
William Colby, a lawyer representing the parents of Nancy Cruzan, said if the 
permanently unconscious woman "was lucid for a moment and could come before 
this court," she would ask that a tube in her stomach providing food and water 
be removed. 
</P>
<P>
"Her liberty interest is as important as her right to life in this case," Colby 
said. "She would choose liberty." 
</P>
<P>
But Assistant Atty. Gen. Robert L. Presson of Missouri said the parents have no 
constitutional right to precipitate their daughter's death. 
</P>
<P>
"In this extraordinary situation, the decision should be made by a judicial 
body," Presson said, referring to a state court ruling that the feeding tubes 
must be retained. 
</P>
<P>
Solicitor General Kenneth Starr, the Bush Administration's top courtroom 
lawyer, supported Presson. 
</P>
<P>
Starr urged the court to give states "wide latitude that reflects reasonably 
the wishes" of their citizens "in this highly sensitive and deeply vexing 
situation." 
</P>
<P>
There is no constitutional right to choose to die in such cases that overrides 
a state's determination to require continued food and water for unconscious 
patients, Starr said. 
</P>
<P>
The justices, preparing for their first "right-to-die" decision, asked 
extensive questions of the lawyers. 
</P>
<P>
Justice Sandra Day O'Connor asked whether a lower court that required the 
life-support treatment for Cruzan decided the case based on "the best interests 
of the patient?" 
</P>
<P>
Justice Anthony M. Kennedy told Colby, "You presume there is a liberty to die 
without clear and convincing evidence" of the patient's wishes. 
</P>
<P>
In his presentation to the justices, Colby said of Cruzan, "She is an 
unconscious shell in a roomful of strangers for the rest of her life." 
</P>
<P>
Cruzan, 32, has been in what doctors call a persistent vegetative state for 
almost seven years. Her parents, Joe and Joyce Cruzan, are asking the court to 
let them order removal of a surgically implanted tube providing her with food 
and water. 
</P>
<P>
The Missouri Supreme Court ruled doctors may not remove the tube. 
</P>
<P>
Cruzan suffered severe brain damage in a Jan. 11, 1983, car crash.
