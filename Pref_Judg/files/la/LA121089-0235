<P>
These are key health effects of some of the major pollutants in the Southern 
California environment. 
</P>
<P>
AIR POLLUTANTS 
</P>
<P>
* Ozone: This colorless, irritant form of oxygen is the most pervasive air 
pollutant. At high altitudes, it protects the earth from harmful ultraviolet 
radiation, but it can be formed in excess when sunlight interacts with 
hydrocarbons and nitrogen oxides emitted by cars and industry. Short-term 
effects of exposures include headaches, eye irritation, sore throat, coughing, 
wheezing, and chest discomfort. Chronic exposures to high levels of ozone 
appear to accelerate the aging process of the lung and people who live in 
highly polluted areas are likely to have a greater risk of developing chronic 
lung diseases. The effect is independent of the effects of tobacco smoking. 
Scientists have not been able to prove that chronic ozone exposure increases 
the risk of developing lung and other cancers. 
</P>
<P>
* Nitrogen oxides: Like ozone, nitrogen oxides are harmful lung irritants. They 
are produced when fossil fuels such as gasoline and oil are burned. The brown 
gas may increase susceptibility to bronchitis and other respiratory infections. 
</P>
<P>
* Particulates: These are microscopic liquid droplets or solids less than the 
width of a human hair that are suspended in the atmosphere. They include soil, 
metals, sulfates, nitrates and organic chemicals. The smallest particles, those 
less than 10 microns in diameter, or PM-10, are the greatest health hazard 
because they can be breathed deeply into the lungs. They may increase 
susceptibility to respiratory infections. The average Los Angeles Basin 
resident has a risk of death in any year of 1 in 10,000 greater than would be 
the case if federal PM-10 standards were met, according to a study prepared for 
the South Coast Air Quality Management District. Riverside and San Bernardino 
County residents have risks that are about twice the basin average; Orange 
County residents are below the average. By contrast, the yearly risk of dying 
in a motor vehicle accident in California is two in 10,000. 
</P>
<P>
* Carbon monoxide: This colorless, odorless gas is produced by incomplete 
combustion of gasoline and other carbon-containing fuels. More than 90% of the 
carbon monoxide in the basin is emitted directly from motor vehicles. Carbon 
monoxide interferes with the oxygen-carrying capability of the blood. Symptoms 
include headaches and breathing difficulties. Individuals with heart disease 
may have increased vulnerability to angina, a chest pain caused by oxygen 
deprivation of the heart, or irregular heart beats during exercise. 
</P>
<P>
* Sulfur compounds: Sulfur dioxide is a colorless gas with a sharp odor that is 
emitted by power plants, petroleum refineries and chemical plants. It can be 
converted to the more irritant sulfuric acid, which contributes to acid rain, 
and a variety of sulfur-containing particles. Exposures can cause asthmatic 
reactions as well as nose, throat and eye irritation. Sulfur compounds are one 
of the few significant pollutants that are not abundant in Southern California 
air. 
</P>
<P>
* Toxic chemicals. There are hundreds of cancer-causing chemicals in Southern 
California air, but only about 10, including benzene, chromium, and ethylene 
dibromide, are specifically regulated, according to Dr. John Froines, director 
of the UCLA Occupational Health Center. These compounds may be emitted through 
industrial combustion or when fuels, solvents and paints evaporate. Researchers 
lack good estimates of the number of cancers or birth defects that may be 
caused by air-borne toxics. 
</P>
<P>
DRINKING WATER 
</P>
<P>
Federal law requires that all water be disinfected to prevent the transmission 
of infectious diseases. 
</P>
<P>
In general, when a drinking water source, such as a well, is found to contain 
excess pollutants, health guidelines are met by either closing the well or 
blending the well water with water from other cleaner supplies. But there may 
be health risks from the low concentrations of regulated chemicals that are 
permitted in drinking water, high concentrations of regulated chemicals that 
escape detection, and unregulated contaminants. 
</P>
<P>
* Nitrates: Nitrates are California's major ground water pollutant. They enter 
through nitrogen-based fertilizers, animal wastes, sewage spills and septic 
tanks. The maximum contaminant level is 45 parts per million. Nitrates are 
primarily a hazard to infants. Nitrite, a nitrate conversion product, can cause 
methemoglobinemia, or "blue baby syndrome," a potentially fatal interference 
with the oxygen-carrying capacity of the blood. 
</P>
<P>
* Organic chemicals: Surface water and ground water may be contaminated by 
hundreds of chemicals, including pesticides, such as dibromochloropropane 
(DBCP), and industrial solvents, such as trichloroethane, trichloroethylene 
(TCE) and perchloroethylene. While the health effects of specific organic 
chemicals vary, the general concerns relate to cancer, birth defects, and, in 
the case of DBCP, sterility in highly exposed men. 
</P>
<P>
* Disinfection byproducts: These are formed when chemicals added to water to 
prevent infectious diseases react with organic materials that are present in 
the water. One example is trihalomethanes (THMs), which are produced when 
chlorine reacts with organic materials. "Trihalomethanes in treated water 
represent a higher cancer risk than most toxic pollutants at the levels that 
the latter have been measured in drinking water," according to an article by 
California Department of Health Services officials. The maximum contaminant 
level of 100 parts per billion would be expected to cause 200 additional cancer 
cases in 1 million people over a 70-year lifetime. Public health officials 
justify this risk by pointing to the even greater benefits of preventing 
water-borne infectious diseases, caused by bacteria and other germs. 
</P>
<P>
OCEAN WATER 
</P>
<P>
The Southern California ocean has been contaminated by millions of gallons of 
pesticides, gasoline industrial wastes, storm drain runoff and untreated and 
partly treated sewage. These contaminants may pose health risks to swimmers, 
boaters and individuals who eat contaminated seafood. In general, many of these 
health risks can be minimized by following the recommendations of health 
officials. Do not, for example, swim near storm drain outfalls or at beaches 
that are closed because of sewage contamination or fish or collect mussels and 
other shellfish in known hazardous areas. 
</P>
<P>
* Swimming: When unapproved areas are avoided, state health officials say it is 
unlikely that ocean swimmers will contract bacterial diarrhea and other 
water-borne ailments. 
</P>
<P>
* Seafood consumption: The safety of seafood from Southern California coastal 
waters is variable, according to state health officials. Specific warnings have 
been issued for certain fish from certain areas. For example, white croaker 
from much of Santa Monica Bay may be contaminated by DDT and polychlorinated 
biphenyls, or PCBs. Health officials are only now in the process of analyzing 
recently collected fish samples from up and down the coast that may help to 
pinpoint the potential risk from other areas and for other fish. Until more 
data is available, a general guideline is to not eat the same fish caught in 
the same spot all the time. It is also prudent to cook mussels, oysters and 
other shellfish. 
</P>
<P>
SOIL POLLUTANTS 
</P>
<P>
Soil pollutants include pesticides, solvents, metals, acids, and petroleum 
wastes. These pollutants are most likely to be found near dumps that accept 
toxic wastes and near industrial sites. Thousands of sites have been identified 
in Southern California where industry and, in some cases, local governments 
have dumped or spilled hazardous materials that could represent some risk to 
the public health. 
</P>
<P>
Soil pollutants may pose a general health risk if they contaminate ground water 
supplies. In addition, extremely toxic pollutants may be produced when organic 
chemicals are burned.
