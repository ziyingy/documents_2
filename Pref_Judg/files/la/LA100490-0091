Richard T. Silberman, sentenced last week to 46 months in federal prison for 
his role in a money-laundering scheme, was ordered to pay a $50,000 fine amid 
disclosure that the once-wealthy San Diego financier owes more than $1.5 
million in legal fees.

Despite Silberman's whopping debts, which total at least $2.1 million, U.S. 
District Judge J. Lawrence Irving imposed the fine because he was not convinced 
Silberman was unable to pay a fine required under rigid new federal sentencing 
guidelines, according to court documents. "We are satisfied with the judge's 
ruling and I think this closes the book on Richard Silberman," said Assistant 
U.S. Atty. Charles F. Gorder.
