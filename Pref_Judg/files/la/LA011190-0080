The United States has begun delicate talks with the Panamanian government in 
hopes of persuading its leaders to create an anti-narcotics police force and to 
implement new restrictions on banking in order to consolidate gains in the war 
on drugs won with the ouster of Manuel A. Noriega, according to U.S. and 
Panamanian officials. 
</P>
<P>
As a gesture of good faith, a senior State Department official announced here 
Wednesday that the Bush Administration plans to move with unprecedented haste 
to formally certify that Panama is cooperating with the United States on 
anti-drug matters. Such a move would thereby restore trade benefits cut off by 
Congress to punish the Noriega regime for its reputed sponsorship of 
international drug trafficking. 
</P>
<P>
But sources familiar with the discussions said that new President Guillermo 
Endara and acting Atty. Gen. Ricardo Arias Calderon reacted with "some 
sensitivity" to the proposals by Assistant Secretary of State Melvyn R. 
Levitsky on banking and law enforcement, which would require reforms in two 
Panamanian institutions. 
</P>
<P>
The quest for further safeguards against a resumption of drug-related 
activities here comes as U.S. officials, in a softening of earlier 
pronouncements, acknowledged that the removal of Noriega was, by itself, likely 
to have only minimal impact on the flow of cocaine to the United States. 
</P>
<P>
The officials said that even under Noriega, who is facing trial in the United 
States on drug trafficking charges, Panama played only an insignificant role as 
a transit point for cocaine shipments on their way north from South America. 
Although Panamanian banks were favored repositories for illicit drug profits, 
even that money-laundering role appears to have diminished in the last two 
years because of the weak economy here, they said. 
</P>
<P>
An indication of the more sober assessment of the extent of the Noriega 
regime's direct participation in drug trafficking came as the State Department 
anti-narcotics chief sought to explain what would be different about the new 
Panamanian government. 
</P>
<P>
"It's primarily a question of attitude," he said. "The message from this 
government (to drug traffickers) is: 'Hands off Panama. Don't come here.' " 
</P>
<P>
In an earlier interview, Drug Enforcement Administration spokesman Frank Shults 
described cocaine trafficking through Panama under Noriega as a "minor matter." 
A reduction in shipments as a result of the strongman's ouster alone "is not 
going to happen," he warned bluntly. 
</P>
<P>
The officials stressed that the removal of Noriega could nevertheless provide a 
major benefit to the drug war by depriving drug traffickers of the haven they 
once enjoyed, and by opening the way for vigorous enforcement of drug laws by 
the new Endara regime. 
</P>
<P>
But a senior U.S. official with expertise in drug matters also emphasized the 
need to consolidate that gain through persuading the Endara government to 
introduce new anti-drug reforms that might bring about tangible achievements. 
</P>
<P>
The changes being encouraged by the United States, which would primarily affect 
the banking and law enforcement systems, are designed to reform institutions 
whose characteristics offer an enduring opportunity for drug traffickers, 
officials said. 
</P>
<P>
Because drug enforcement remains the responsibility of a joint military-police 
organization dominated by former members of the pro-Noriega Panama Defense 
Forces, the prospect that those forces might prove lax in cracking down on 
narcotics operations remains a "major concern," the U.S. official said. 
</P>
<P>
As an alternative, State Department anti-narcotics chief Levitsky is said to 
have urged Endara and other officials in private meetings Tuesday and Wednesday 
to establish a separate anti-drug force "well insulated" from the taint of PDF 
corruption. 
</P>
<P>
On banking, where secrecy laws continue to make Panamanian banks prospective 
storage places for illicit cash, the U.S. envoy urged the Panamanians to 
approve regulations that would require bank executives to report large or 
suspicious transactions to authorities, according to sources with knowledge of 
the discussion. 
</P>
<P>
Such a restriction could well diminish the attraction of Panama as a banking 
center, even to some depositors who acquired their funds legally -- and on that 
basis it was greeted coldly by the new Panamanian leaders, the sources said. 
But the American representatives held out hope that pressure from the United 
States might persuade the Panamanians to accept additional restrictions because 
"they don't want to get crosswise with us," according to one source. 
</P>
<P>
Prospects for the separate reforms in the law enforcement system remained less 
clear, with the Panamanian leadership apparently undecided as to the wisdom of 
going outside the unitary security force to establish a separate anti-drug 
team. 
</P>
<P>
More immediately, the congressional certification would restore to Panama a 
guaranteed share of the U.S. sugar market and would grant most-favored-nation 
status for other Panamanian exports.
