"Eat your vegetables" was a refrain familiar to most of us when we were small. 
We also learned that carrots are nutritious and help us see better at night. 
</P>
<P>
Besides promoting vision, the Vitamin A in carrots and in many other vegetables 
plays a vital role within our bodies. The health of bones and skin depends on 
it. Vitamin A and its relatives may aid in preventing certain cancers and 
ensuring the smooth running of our immune systems. 
</P>
<P>
Vitamin A is not a single entity but a family of compounds with similar 
chemical structures and functions. Members include the parent compound, retinol 
(found only in foods of animal origin, such as eggs, cheese, liver and milk), 
and beta-carotene (an orange pigment found mostly in fruits and vegetables). 
Before it can work as a vitamin, beta-carotene first must be converted to 
retinol by the intestines, a rather inefficient process. Nonetheless, most of 
the Vitamin A used by the body comes from fruit and vegetable sources since 
these are generally more abundant in the diet. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Stored in the Body 
</P>
<P>
Like vitamins D, E and K, Vitamin A is fat-soluble. This means it can be stored 
by the liver, so we don't need to consume it every day. But our ability to 
store the vitamin also creates the possibility of toxic side effects when too 
much is ingested. Food sources present little danger of toxicity. But high-dose 
vitamin supplements may contain enough to do real harm, as the vitamin in 
excess attacks body tissues it normally helps. 
</P>
<P>
One such normal function is Vitamin A's role in vision, as part of a pigment in 
the retina called visual purple. At night, when incoming light hits the retina, 
the visual purple is "bleached." The chemical change sends a message to the 
brain that is converted to a meaningful image. In this bleaching process, some 
of the Vitamin A is destroyed; a steady supply is required to replace it. If 
you're deficient in Vitamin A, you'll develop night blindness, characterized by 
an inability to recover vision after a flash of bright light. Luckily, 
correcting the deficiency provides a complete cure. 
</P>
<P>
Vitamin A is also needed to maintain moist and healthy tissues throughout the 
body, including the eye. With deficiency, the eye becomes dry and opaque and 
sometimes, if left untreated, irreversibly scarred. Children are particularly 
susceptible: Worldwide, Vitamin A deficiency is responsible for 500,000 cases 
of childhood blindness each year. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Vital to Healthy Skin 
</P>
<P>
The skin also reacts to a shortage of Vitamin A, turning cracked and dry, 
losing the protective barrier against germs that healthy skin provides. Of 
course, dry skin has many causes, and dietary Vitamin A can help only when 
Vitamin A deficiency is the culprit. Recently, however, dermatologists have 
begun using Vitamin A derivatives to treat various skin disorders, including 
acne and psoriasis. 
</P>
<P>
The skin cream Retin-A, also intended for use against severe acne, lately has 
received publicity for claims that it may reduce wrinkles and dryness linked to 
aging. In all these cases, Vitamin A-like compounds are being used as drugs, 
not nutrients, and must be monitored by a doctor. Dangerous side effects, 
including fetal birth defects, can result from careless use. 
</P>
<P>
What about evidence on Vitamin A as an anti-cancer agent? Although still 
inconclusive, it does suggest that both beta-carotene and retinol-like 
compounds, called retinoids, may have cancer-preventing properties. Population 
studies have shown lower rates of lung, stomach, bladder, colon and prostate 
cancer where beta-carotene intakes are high. Possibly, beta-carotene reduces 
the damage that certain forms of oxygen cause the cell. Other research 
indicates that retinoids, experimental drugs derived from retinol, might keep 
cancer-causing substances from binding with a cell's genetic material, thereby 
preventing the uncontrolled cell division characteristic of cancer. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Immune System Connection 
</P>
<P>
A diet rich in Vitamin A may also help bolster the immune system, which battles 
bacteria and viruses. This system is dually composed of special proteins called 
antibodies and white blood cells, including lymphocytes. Together, the two 
teams recognize and destroy foreign invaders. Studies have found that Vitamin A 
stimulates the activity of both divisions of the immune system. The positive 
effects, however, depend on the amount of the vitamin. High doses may actually 
suppress immune function. 
</P>
<P>
The final conclusions on Vitamin A and beta-carotene in cancer prevention may 
be years away. We do know for certain that large doses of the parent compound 
are toxic. Vitamin A should never be taken as a single supplement except under 
the continued supervision of a doctor. 
</P>
<P>
On the other hand, consuming generous amounts of Vitamin A itself, particularly 
from fortified low-fat and skim milk, and hearty servings of beta-carotene rich 
fruits such as cantaloupe, yellow peaches and apricots, and dark green and deep 
yellow vegetables, makes very good sense. It will provide the full quota of 
Vitamin A for those needs we know about, and may offer added benefits besides.

New Guidelines on Blood Cholesterol 
</P>
<P>
Question: Throughout the years I have received conflicting information about 
what is a reasonable blood-cholesterol level. Has the figure dropped? 
</P>
<P>
Answer: Yes. By now you've probably heard of the National Cholesterol Education 
Program, launched four years ago by the National Heart, Lung and Blood 
Institute. The goal is to reduce elevated blood-cholesterol levels in the 
United States, thereby helping to cut down on illness and deaths from heart 
disease. As part of its activities, the NCEP established several expert panels 
to develop recommendations and guidelines. One, the Adult Treatment Panel, has 
issued new guidelines for classifying and treating individuals with elevated 
cholesterol. 
</P>
<P>
The classification process begins with a blood test. A serum cholesterol less 
than 200 milligrams per deciliter is considered desirable; those between 200 
and 239 milligrams, borderline-high risk; and those above 240 milligrams per 
deciliter, high risk. 
</P>
<P>
People with cholesterol levels in the borderline-high range who also have 
definite coronary heart disease or at least two other risk factors (being male, 
having a family history of premature heart disease, current smoking of more 
than 10 cigarettes a day, high blood pressure, diabetes, a history of specific 
types of circulatory disease, and obesity), and those whose cholesterol falls 
into the high range should also undergo further tests to measure levels of 
lipoproteins. 
</P>
<P>
The results of those tests enable the physician to decide whether a treatment 
program is indicated. The need for this second level of screening is far from 
rare. It has recently been estimated that lipoprotein analysis will be 
indicated for as many as 41% of all adults after an initial cholesterol 
screening.

Q: I love fresh figs. Given their sweet taste, I assume they are high in 
calories. Can you tell me about their nutritional value? 
</P>
<P>
A: As with anything else, calories are a function of size. A large fig, about 2 
1/2 inches in diameter, and weighing just over two ounces, provides 50 
calories, nearly all of them from the sugar they contain. In fact, a syrup made 
from figs was used as a sweetener as far back as 3000 BC in Assyria. 
</P>
<P>
In addition to calories, figs provide small amounts of a number of B vitamins 
and, like many other fruits, they are a good source of potassium. 
</P>
<P>
Q: I know about potential risks to the fetus linked to using alcohol during 
pregnancy. I also know that drugs show up in human milk. But have there been 
studies of the effects of alcohol use by mothers on the nursing infant? 
</P>
<P>
A: The question is difficult to study, and any firm conclusions require further 
research. Nonetheless, one recent study does suggest that alcohol use while 
nursing can have a negative effect on development. 
</P>
<P>
It's been recognized for some time that nursing infants are exposed to alcohol 
through human milk, although the amount is only a fraction of that consumed by 
the mother. Investigators compared the effects of exposure to alcohol through 
breast milk in a group of 400 1-year-old children. No difference in mental 
development could be detected. 
</P>
<P>
But motor control was significantly lower in infants exposed regularly to 
alcohol in breast milk. Moreover, there was a direct relationship in average 
scores and performance on the test of motor development. That is, scores 
declined directly as alcohol exposure increased. More than 100 other possible 
factors that might help explain the differences were ruled out. 
</P>
<P>
We should point out that there was no difference in test performance between 
infants who were exposed to no alcohol and those who were exposed to only very 
small quantities. 
</P>
