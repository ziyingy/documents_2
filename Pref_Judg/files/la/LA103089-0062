<P>
Most Californians are willing to pay a higher sales tax temporarily to raise 
money for Bay Area earthquake repairs and relief, but they strongly oppose 
increasing the gasoline tax, The Times Poll has found. 
</P>
<P>
Most people also say they want the state Department of Transportation to place 
its highest priority on repairing old freeways to make them safer, rather than 
building new roadways to relieve traffic congestion, the survey showed. 
</P>
<P>
Half the people, furthermore, think that Caltrans should cancel its plans to 
double-deck crowded freeways, such as the Harbor in Los Angeles, in view of the 
collapse of the double-deck Nimitz Freeway in Oakland. 
</P>
<P>
Half the people blame no one for the Nimitz's collapse, but a third say 
incompetence in construction may have played a part, and 15% even suspect 
fraud. 
</P>
<P>
The Times Poll, directed by I.A. Lewis, interviewed 1,377 adults by telephone 
Thursday through Saturday in the first statewide poll measuring 
earthquake-related attitudes since the San Francisco Bay Area and the adjacent 
Santa Cruz-Hollister regions were struck with a devastating temblor Oct. 17. 
The 7.1-magnitude quake killed at least 63 people and caused more than $7 
billion in damage. 
</P>
<P>
Gov. George Deukmejian and legislative leaders are scheduled to meet in 
Sacramento today to set the agenda for a special session of the Legislature to 
decide how to finance the state's share of earthquake repairs and assistance 
for victims. 
</P>
<P>
Both the governor and legislative leaders are considering a temporary increase 
in the sales tax, which now ranges from 6 to 7 cents in various regions, or a 
stopgap hike in the 18-cent-per-gallon state/federal tax on gasoline -- or a 
combination of both taxes. Deukmejian reportedly is leaning toward asking 
merely for standby authority to raise taxes on his own if he decides that the 
state's present tax system is not producing enough money for earthquake repairs 
and relief. 
</P>
<P>
Of those surveyed by The Times, 52% said they would accept a higher sales tax 
"for some period of time in order to pay for earthquake repairs and to aid 
earthquake victims in Northern California." Forty-one percent opposed a sales 
tax hike and 7% were undecided. 
</P>
<P>
For politicians trying to make the tough decision, the good news was that 
people who are registered to vote are especially supportive of a sales tax 
increase -- by 55% to 38%. Democrats and Republicans alike feel this way. 
Non-voters are about evenly divided on the question. 
</P>
<P>
Not surprisingly, Southern California residents are less enthusiastic than 
Northern Californians are about paying a higher sales tax to benefit the Bay 
Area. 
</P>
<P>
By race, most whites and blacks support a sales tax hike, but Latinos are split 
about evenly. 
</P>
<P>
On the average, people said they would be willing to have the sales tax 
increased by about 1 cent on the dollar for a period of roughly two years -- an 
especially generous gesture. That would raise around $8.6 billion, far more 
than the state anticipates ever needing to finance victim assistance and 
structural repairs resulting from the Oct. 17 earthquake. 
</P>
<P>
But the gasoline tax is another matter. Of those interviewed, only 36% 
supported raising it. A whopping 60% opposed the idea, with just 4% undecided. 
</P>
<P>
Voters and non-voters, Democrats and Republicans, northerners and southerners 
alike all opposed a gas tax increase. 
</P>
<P>
Furthermore, the disastrous earthquake has generated no new support for a 
sweeping ballot measure offered by Deukmejian and the Legislature that would 
permanently raise the gasoline tax by 9 cents a gallon and revise the state 
spending limit to finance highway construction and improvements. The proposal 
is destined for the state primary ballot next June. 
</P>
<P>
In this post-earthquake survey, only 25% of the registered voters favored the 
ballot measure, with 55% opposing it and 20% undecided. In an earlier, 
pre-earthquake survey by The Times Poll this month, the results were 
essentially the same: 29% in favor, 53% opposed and 18% undecided. 
</P>
<P>
Since the Oct. 17 temblor, Caltrans Director Robert K. Best has conceded that 
earthquake safety in recent years "was not the highest priority . . . for the 
expenditure of whatever funds became available." However, Californians 
apparently now think that it should be. 
</P>
<P>
Asked whether they think "a priority should be given to repairing old freeways 
to make them safer, or a priority should be given to constructing new freeways 
to help ease traffic congestion," 57% opted for making existing roads safer. 
Only 32% said build more highways, and 11% were not sure. People all over the 
state generally felt this way. 
</P>
<P>
In Los Angeles County, where motorists daily encounter bumper-to-bumper traffic 
jams but also live with the nagging fear of someday being rocked by a massive 
earthquake, people by 2 to 1 favor placing the priority on freeway structural 
safety rather than on freeway expansion. 
</P>
<P>
And with 39 confirmed deaths in the Nimitz collapse freshly in their minds, 
Californians also believe, by a narrow 5-4 ratio, that Caltrans should scrub 
its plans to double-deck freeways. 
</P>
<P>
In Los Angeles County, there are plans to double-deck not only 2.6 miles of the 
Harbor just south of downtown, but also parts of the Ventura, Santa Ana, San 
Diego and Santa Monica freeways. Los Angeles residents are more opposed to 
double-decking than other Californians, rejecting the concept by about 3 to 2. 
In the Bay Area, people still tend to favor double-decking. 
</P>
<P>
While half the people reject the notion that construction incompetence or fraud 
were to blame for the crumbling of the Nimitz, 61% nevertheless believe that 
"the government" has failed to do "all it could to make sure the freeways are 
safe enough to use." 
</P>
<P>
Californians say they are concerned about earthquake safety, but many also seem 
to accept temblors as a way of life in this state. 
</P>
<P>
Two-thirds say they have experienced an earthquake -- and more than half of 
these people report it was a "bad" experience. Moreover, according to this 
survey, people believe that the chances are better than 50-50 that "the big 
one" -- with a magnitude of 8 or higher -- will strike in or very near the area 
where they live. 
</P>
<P>
Yet 90% said that since the Oct. 17 earthquake they have not "thought about 
moving away" to another area. This generally was the sentiment all over the 
state. 
</P>
<P>
Nearly two-thirds of those surveyed said they do not have earthquake insurance 
and do not intend to get any. Roughly one-fifth reported they already had quake 
insurance before Oct. 17 and another one-tenth said they now plan to obtain it. 
</P>
<P>
Only 21% said that since the Northern California temblor hit have they "taken 
certain earthquake precautions around the house" -- such as securing loose 
objects, placing straps around water heaters, moving heavy objects closer to 
the floor, making window glass shatterproof or bolting the house frame to its 
foundation. People living in Los Angeles County and the Bay Area have tended to 
take these steps more than other Californians. 
</P>
<P>
Only 37% said they have stocked up on "certain supplies people ought to have on 
hand in case of an earthquake" -- such as a portable radio, flashlight, extra 
batteries, first-aid kit, adjustable wrench for turning off water and gas 
lines, bottled water and canned or dried food. 
</P>
<P>
However, 62% of those interviewed said they would feel safe at home "if 'the 
big' earthquake struck." Only 38% said they would feel safe at work. And just 
36% felt they would be safe driving on the roadways and bridges near their 
homes. 
</P>
<P>
In the stricken Bay Area, 43% of the people said they had "experienced 
psychological aftereffects from the earthquake" -- such as loss of appetite, 
having trouble concentrating, being depressed, frequently fearing for their 
safety, being more irritable than usual or having sleepless nights. Even in the 
rest of the state, 21% reported experiencing these psychological aftereffects. 
</P>
<P>
But asked to name "the most important problem facing California today," 
earthquake preparedness ranked low on the list. Crime and drugs, as usual, 
rated at the top, being chosen by 69%. (People were given up to two choices.) 
Next came homelessness, 22%; education, 20%; auto insurance, 18%; earthquake 
preparedness and the environment, both with 14%; health care, 9%, and 
transportation, 8%. 
</P>
<P>
Finally, 69% agreed that it was "proper" to have resumed the World Series in 
the Bay Area 10 days after the earthquake. Another 15% felt it should have been 
played somewhere else and 8% think it should have been canceled. Men, more than 
women, favored keeping the series in San Francisco. 
</P>
<P>
The margin of error for a survey of this size is three percentage points in 
either direction. Of those surveyed, 1,041 were registered to vote and the 
error margin for just these people was four points. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
THE BIG ONE 
</P>
<P>
The average Californian thinks the chances are a little better than 50-50 that 
"the big one," a major earthquake of magnitude 8 or more, will strike in or 
very near the area in which he or she lives. 
</P>
<P>
People had differing views about the safest place to be:
