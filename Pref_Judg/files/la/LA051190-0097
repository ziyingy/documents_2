<P>
Cows, none too couth to begin with, contaminate. Only the cows can't help it. 
</P>
<P>
It turns out that all that cud-chewing gives off lots of gas, an average of 400 
liters per cow per day, and, environmentally speaking, that stinks. 
</P>
<P>
So this is a serious problem. A '90s kind of problem. Cows are not conversant 
with catalytic converters. 
</P>
<P>
According to reliable sources, this makes cows the world's third-largest source 
of methane released into the atmosphere, behind only natural wetlands and rice 
paddies. 
</P>
<P>
I didn't know about the paddies or the wetlands either. I'm learning a lot in 
the afterglow of Earth Day '90. 
</P>
<P>
Take dolphins. I love dolphins. Before I became environmentally aware, I wanted 
nothing more than to have a dolphin live in our back yard swimming pool in 
Miami. I was in the sixth grade. I was selfish. 
</P>
<P>
I know better now, of course. I'm a grown-up, thinking globally. Dolphins don't 
do private back-yard swimming pools. They hang out at posh Hawaiian resorts, 
where tourists pay an hourly rate to frolic with them in man-made lagoons. 
</P>
<P>
But seriously, the slaughter of dolphins in the pursuit of tuna has always 
weighed heavily upon my environmental conscience. Even when I didn't know 
that's what I had. 
</P>
<P>
Loving dolphins was the perfect excuse for hating tuna, ranking right up there 
with smelling like old, pulverized fish and tasting like worse. 
</P>
<P>
Things are changing, however. 
</P>
<P>
The three companies that produce 70% of the tuna sold on the U.S. market have 
agreed to stop using nets that kill dolphins, and, effective immediately, Alpo 
Petfoods says that its yummy tuna cat food will also be dolphin-safe. Estimates 
are that tens of thousands of dolphins will be saved each year. 
</P>
<P>
Still, the environmental movement has shown me how intertwined things really 
are on Planet Earth. So I'd been wondering about what all those dolphins were 
going to do with their new lease on life. 
</P>
<P>
Then I picked up Newsweek magazine, and I may have found out. Seems the U.S. 
Navy might be hatching plans to turn them into warmongers. 
</P>
<P>
The Navy "would neither confirm nor deny" that it is arming dolphins with nose 
cones spring-loaded with .45-caliber bullets as part of a "swimmer 
nullification" program against enemy frogmen. 
</P>
<P>
But let's get real here. Dolphins are no dummies. Give those babies weapons 
and, next thing you know, they'll be taking their revenge against tuna 
fishermen, Hawaiian hotel owners and schoolchildren on field trips to Sea 
World. 
</P>
<P>
Look for gang graffiti on boat hulls. It could be an early warning sign. 
</P>
<P>
What I'm saying here is that if there's one big lesson from Earth Day '90, it's 
that everything's connected. What goes around comes around. In other words, 
just when you think you might have one problem licked, you find out your 
so-called solution is giving off toxic wastes. 
</P>
<P>
Gasohol's another example. For years, grain alcohol in gasoline has been touted 
as a sure-fire way to help clean up the air we're breathing. An amendment to 
the Clean Air Act approved by the Senate mandates its use. 
</P>
<P>
Well, a study's just been released that concludes that using gasohol would cut 
carbon monoxide by 25% but that nitrogen oxides, which cause smog and acid 
rain, would jump as high as 15% and hydrocarbons would double. Net impact: 6% 
more smog. 
</P>
<P>
The upshot, I suppose, is that being environmentally correct these days is no 
easy task. It takes stamina and mental acuity, a conclusion that all the 
public-opinion polls bear out. 
</P>
<P>
When asked, people say they'll separate their trash, forgo patterned toilet 
paper and cut a plastic ring to save a sea gull. And the excuses they come up 
with for not car-pooling! I tell you, it really makes an American proud. Those 
poll respondents can really think on their toes! They're definitely sharp. 
</P>
<P>
Not that we Americans don't deserve to be cut some slack. Most people want to 
do what's environmentally sound. And only the extremely environmentally earnest 
don't get discouraged about it all now and then. 
</P>
<P>
Lords knows, even I have been known to get a little down in the mouth. 
Sometimes the complexity of The Issue just gets to be a bit much. 
</P>
<P>
Defiance takes over. At these times, it seems to be in my blood. I want to mow, 
mulch, fertilize and water turf grass. The urge to fire up the back-yard 
barbecue, using lots of starter fluid, is strong. Ordering my groceries bagged 
in double plastic wouldn't be out of the question during flashes like these. 
</P>
<P>
But then I get ahold of myself. I realize that, deep down, I really do want to 
be part of the solution. 
</P>
<P>
Only a cynic would say that I didn't care. 
</P>
