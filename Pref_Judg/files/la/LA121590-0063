A county prosecutor said Friday he will not appeal the dismissal of a 
first-degree murder charge against a retired pathologist whose "suicide 
machine" was used by an Alzheimer's disease patient to kill herself. 
</P>
<P>
The case against Dr. Jack Kevorkian, of Royal Oak, Mich., was thrown out 
Thursday by Oakland County District Judge Gerald McNally. 
</P>
<P>
His ruling followed two days of testimony and the viewing of a dramatic 
videotape in which Janet Adkins told Kevorkian, "I don't want to go on." 
</P>
<P>
Adkins, 54, of Portland, Ore., died June 4 in the back of Kevorkian's van in a 
remote park. She was hooked up to an intravenous device that permitted her to 
inject herself with a lethal solution. 
</P>
<P>
Oakland County prosecutor Richard Thompson said Friday that he will not appeal 
the ruling and that it is time for the Michigan Legislature to eliminate 
confusion over assisting in suicides. 
</P>
<P>
He said he was not conceding that it was legal, but he would not pursue further 
legal action against Kevorkian. 
</P>
<P>
"I think this is a question preeminently for the legislative branch of 
government," Thompson said, pointing to a movement in the state Senate to make 
assisting in a suicide a felony. 
</P>
<P>
McNally held that Kevorkian committed no crime under state law. He said the 
question of criminality in assisting in a suicide is an issue for the 
Legislature. 
</P>
<P>
Michigan Gov.-elect John Engler, reacting to McNally's ruling, said he will 
push for legislation to outlaw helping a person commit suicide. He said he 
hopes the Legislature will act on such a measure early in the 1991 session. 
</P>
<P>
Thompson said he will prosecute any other similar cases that occur in Oakland 
County.
