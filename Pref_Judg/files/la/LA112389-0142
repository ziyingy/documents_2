Steel Restraints Extended: Congress approved a bill extending agreements with 
other nations to restrain their steel exports into the United States in order 
to boost recovery of the U.S. steel industry. The bill extends for 2 1/2 more 
years the restraints already negotiated by the United States with steel 
producing nations under a program begun five years ago.
