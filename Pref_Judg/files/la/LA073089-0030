<P>
This city has made a comeback. 
</P>
<P>
Situated by the Galena River near the Mississippi in northwestern Illinois, 
Galena was the Midwest's business and cultural center in the mid-1800s. People 
exchanged local produce and ores for luxury goods brought up the river from the 
South. 
</P>
<P>
Main Street, lined with two- and three-story buildings, was dominated by DeSoto 
House, a hotel built in 1855 that accommodated traders, tourists and, on one 
occasion, Abraham Lincoln. Ulysses S. Grant, who lived in Galena, had a 
Victorian house on the hill overlooking town. 
</P>
<P>
Galena's fortunes changed when local politicians told the railroad to build its 
terminal elsewhere. River boats, they believed, were all the transportation 
that Galena needed. So the iron horse steamed into Chicago, then just a small 
town. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Population Moves 
</P>
<P>
Chicago's star subsequently rose and Galena's faded. When the mines gave out, 
much of Galena's population moved on and the town was all but forgotten. 
</P>
<P>
But after a century of neglect, Galena is thriving, with visitors attracted by 
the town's turn-of-the-century quaintness. 
</P>
<P>
Galena was featured in the recent hit film "Field of Dreams." A refurbished 
DeSoto House is often full, and Main Street's storefronts, all restored, offer 
antiques as well as reasonably priced clothing, personal accessories and home 
furnishings. 
</P>
<P>
Main Street runs from north to south, with shops concentrated in a five-block 
span. Begin at either end, but don't miss these: 
</P>
<P>
The Toy Soldier Collection (DeSoto House, 228 S. Main St.) sells miniature 
warriors (from $40) outfitted in Napoleonic, Civil War and other uniforms, plus 
diminutive Grants. Owner W. Paul Le Greco, a Grant look-alike, is well known
