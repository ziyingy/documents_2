Mobil -- An Op-Ed Page article Thursday about a Torrance ballot measure on the 
Mobil refinery misstated the number of injured in a Nov. 24, 1987, explosion at 
the plant. The figure should have been 10. The reference to scores of injured 
was meant to cover several incidents at the refinery in recent years.
