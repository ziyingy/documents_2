If I were a race horse today, I think I would be in deep depression. I'd want 
to wear black bandages and tail ribbons and a black plume. I'd mope a lot and 
feel like putting crepe on the barn door. 
</P>
<P>
Horses everywhere should be in mourning. They are losing their best friend. 
</P>
<P>
I don't think Bill Shoemaker ever abused a dying 10-1 shot or even a fading 
favorite in his life. He never brought even a winner to the finish line in 
filets. Other riders were known as the Slasher, the Ripper. Eddie Arcaro came 
down the lane like a Cossack running down peasants. 
</P>
<P>
Shoemaker rode a horse as if he owed him money. Horses loved Willie Shoemaker. 
They ran out of sheer terror for other riders, a Manny Ycaza, a Willie Hartack. 
They were trying to get away from the whipping, the screaming, the kicking. 
</P>
<P>
Shoemaker came to the wire as if he were on a carousel. Horses would do 
anything for him. He never had to browbeat one in his life. It didn't matter 
whether he was on Swaps or a $10,000 claimer, they gave their all for him. 
</P>
<P>
He's the greatest horse rider in history. No Geronimo, Sundance Kid, pony 
express man, sergeant major in Custer's cavalry ever had the way with a horse 
Bill Shoemaker had. He won more races than any rider who ever lived and he did 
it with a velvet touch and graceful pace that made every race a ballet, not a 
charge. 
</P>
<P>
Shoemaker rode a horse the way DiMaggio caught a fly ball, or Sinatra sang a 
ballad -- with the effortless ease and grace of a guy born to do what he was 
doing. Watching Shoe ride a horse was like watching Gene Kelly dance or Gauguin 
paint. It was art. You had the feeling he could win the Kentucky Derby on a 
Brahma bull. 
</P>
<P>
No one knows the mysterious communication between horse and rider that makes a 
1,200-pound headstrong brute do the one thing in this world he does not want to 
do -- run in a straight line as fast as he can for 2 1/2 minutes. Old-time 
horsemen agree it's in the hands. The horse can sense from the feel of the 
reins whether he's in the grip of a bully or a buddy. 
</P>
<P>
For Shoemaker, they almost purred. 
</P>
<P>
It was not that the Shoe couldn't control a willful, antisocial, temperamental 
runner with a bad attitude. It was just that he found a way to calm that horse 
down, focus him in and make him try his best. He was the boss up there and he 
was an athlete whose reflexes were as quick as the horse's, his nerve that of a 
high-wire walker, his instincts as sure as a timber wolf's. 
</P>
<P>
Shoe could spot holes on the rail before they opened up. It was ironic that he 
was the one who stood in the irons at the wrong pole and lost a Kentucky Derby 
because horsemen like the late Hy Schneider used to say that the great thing 
about Shoemaker was, he never made a mistake on the race track. 
</P>
<P>
He was only 4 feet 11 inches tall but he towered above his sport the way only 
the great ones do. There was Shoemaker -- and then there was everyone else. If 
you think Joe Montana overshadows football, Magic Johnson basketball, or Sugar 
Ray Leonard boxing, you should have seen Shoemaker in his prime. He was so good 
he never got on a longshot in his career. He could get on a burro in a Belmont 
and go off at 6-5 in his prime. 
</P>
<P>
He got all the edge he would ever need in life when he came into it two months 
early. He weighed in at about two pounds and the family physician in the dusty 
little cotton town of Fabens, Tex., predicted that the blue, wizened little 
creature wouldn't last the night. That was on August 19, 58 years ago. 
</P>
<P>
Shoemaker was scarcely a hand's length long when his grandmother, Mrs. Wallie 
Harris, put him in a shoe box behind the stove, which she lit even on that 
sultry summer night. He was to look like an infant till he was almost school 
age and, when his care and feeding was turned over to his Aunt Birdie Wilson, 
family legend has it, she tried everything from diet to shots to get little 
Willie to grow. 
</P>
<P>
Fortunately, she never succeeded. Willie Shoemaker not only stayed a foot 
shorter than most of the rest of mankind -- at least that portion of it in 
Texas -- including his own brother, Lonnie, but he was put on a horse by his 
maternal grandfather almost as soon as he could walk. 
</P>
<P>
"That boy'll never play football, so get him on a horse," he is reputed to have 
advised. 
</P>
<P>
Putting Billy Lee Shoemaker on a horse was like putting Olivier on a stage, 
Hogan on a golf course, or Dempsey in a ring. 
</P>
<P>
Farewell tours are all the rage now. The populace showers basketball players 
with motorcycles, antique clocks and Silver Shadow Rolls-Royces, and Bill 
Shoemaker has been honored every place they have a $2 window. He will be 
finally honored when he rides his last race at Santa Anita on Saturday. 
</P>
<P>
But the remarkable thing about Willie Shoemaker is not the 8,833 races he has 
won or the $123,398,882 his mounts have earned, it's that he's done it without 
any compromise of his integrity or popularity or the respect with which he is 
held. 
</P>
<P>
A man without a jealous bone in his body himself, he has aroused none in his 
contemporaries. Jockeys change agents almost as often as silks but he remained 
with one agent most of his life, until Harry Silbert died. 
</P>
<P>
Racing, like boxing, often tends to tarnish those who make their living in it. 
No breath of scandal or innuendo has ever ranged alongside the name of Bill 
Shoemaker. There has hardly ever been a foul claim lodged against him in all 
the 42 years he has ridden and he has not been set down by the stewards in 
years. 
</P>
<P>
Men, like horses, revere Willie Shoemaker. 
</P>
<P>
It's not that he won Kentucky Derbies 31 years apart or that he rode for as 
long as he did, it's that he maintained the image of a decent, honest, kind 
human being who is almost the same quiet, almost shy and uncomplicated person 
he was when he got out of the shoe box. There are no airs to Willie Shoemaker 
no side to him. 
</P>
<P>
No wonder horses like him. Everyone else does, too. 
</P>
