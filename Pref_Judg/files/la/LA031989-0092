Progress for women academics is slow, even at the prestigious UC Berkeley, 
according to the first study of its kind at the school. The report of the 
Coordinating Committee on the Status of Women, launched in 1987 by a 15-member 
committee, said women still face significant barriers to advancement and equal 
opportunities at the school. Progress in faculty hiring and promotion has been 
"almost non-existent" for minority women while the record has been uneven for 
white women, the report said. The report cited lack of progress in hiring and 
promoting women, particularly minority women, on the faculty and among 
non-tenure track academics and staff, and in recruiting and retaining women 
students in general.
