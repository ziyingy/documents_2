brings on the mariachis, a complimentary buffet, and food and cocktail 
specials. . . . On the 5th only, Peppers in Garden Grove will offer drink 
specials and a free Mexican buffet, and the Hacienda in Santa Ana will open 
early (4 p.m.) for cocktails, help-yourself, Southwestern/Mexican hors

Fritz Rechberger and Diane Hickling have sold A'la Carte Bistro in Huntington 
Beach to Martyn Sells. Rechberger and Hickling move on to ownership of a 
B&amp;B near the Korbel Winery in the Sonoma area (and yes, they'll serve 
dinner there), while Sells promises that any changes at A'la Carte will be

There's a new sign and new owners at the former Sabatino's in Capistrano Beach. 
The name is now Ristorante Agostino, with the DiFante family (father Luigi, 
sons Gino and Agostino) orchestrating lunch and dinner. The DiFantes come from 
just south of Rome, so the cuisine is central Italian. The ocean-view 
restaurant differs from Agostino in South Laguna, which is owned by the same 
family but functions primarily as a take-out.

NO CHANGE: It's business as usual at Hemingway's in Corona del Mar, even though 
the restaurant has filed under Chapter 11 bankruptcy laws for protection from 
its creditors. Owner Randy Johnson says he filed because of financial problems 
in fiscal 1986, stemming from "problems with employees and the internal 
accounting system and other restaurant partnerships that took me away from 
daily mangement. We generated profit in '87, '88 and," he predicts "will for 
'89." Johnson says he is still offering the same range of food, with dinner 
entrees from $16 to $24. Louis Manginelli, who was his chef for 8 1/2 years, is 
back on a part-time/consulting basis.

SMOKE RINGS: The good news for both cigar smokers and nonsmokers is that the 
Ritz-Carlton in Dana Point has inaugurated a "smoker room," designating its
