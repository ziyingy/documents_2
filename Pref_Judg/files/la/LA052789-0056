A juror in the Nancy Hoover Hunter fraud trial disclosed Friday in court that 
her rabbi had told her Hunter was guilty. 
</P>
<P>
The disclosure came after attorneys for Hunter, 50, asked U. S. District Judge 
Earl B. Gilliam to ask each juror and alternate whether they had read anything 
about the case or had spoken to anyone about it. 
</P>
<P>
The unidentified juror told Gilliam that her rabbi asked her what she had been 
doing lately, and she replied that she was a juror in the Hunter case. 
</P>
<P>
"She's guilty," the rabbi responded, according to the juror. 
</P>
<P>
The juror promised the judge she would not consider the rabbi's opinion, and 
she was allowed to remain on the case. 
</P>
<P>
Gilliam turned down a motion by Hunter's lawyers asking that the jury be 
sequestered.
