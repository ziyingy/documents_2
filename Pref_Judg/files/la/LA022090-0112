Defense Secretary Dick Cheney's two-week tour of the Orient is barely half over 
and already he's been snubbed by Corazon Aquino, eaten field rations with some 
talking shrubbery in Hawaii and witnessed a full-body-contact South Korean 
press conference. 
</P>
<P>
The serious purpose of the journey -- to consult with East Asian allies about 
U.S. military strategy in the region and to pay morale-boosting visits to 
American GIs -- has sometimes been overshadowed by unscheduled events. 
</P>
<P>
Cheney barely had touched down in Honolulu a week ago Saturday when word came 
from Manila that Philippines President Aquino would not grant him an audience 
in Manila this week. 
</P>
<P>
Aquino, piqued about comments by senior U.S. officials questioning her grip on 
power and her apparent inability to stem corruption and cronyism in her 
government, said she had no time to see the Pentagon boss. She wouldn't budge, 
even after President Bush told her she might learn a few things from Cheney. 
</P>
<P>
Cheney said, "I don't take it personally" and promptly scratched a day off his 
planned two-day visit to Manila. "I would hope that any unpleasantness is 
minimized," the diplomatic defense secretary said later. 
</P>
<P>
Members of his traveling party were clearly heartbroken, having been forced to 
spend an extra unoccupied day here in Hong Kong, the shopping capital of the 
planet. 
</P>
<P>
Cheney's helicopter landed on a hilltop in the middle of Oahu Island last 
Monday, where he was greeted by Maj. Gen. Fred Gorden, who was to demonstrate 
Army Ranger training among troops of his 25th Infantry Division. 
</P>
<P>
The general and the SecDef, as Cheney is known to the troops, walked into an 
empty clearing in the tropical rain forest when suddenly there was a rustling 
in the bushes. Within seconds, the Secretary was surrounded by about two dozen 
Ranger trainees in full camouflage gear and war paint and covered from head to 
toe in bushes tied to their uniforms. It was an astounding sight; pictures of 
Cheney chatting earnestly with the foliage led all the Honolulu evening 
television news broadcasts. 
</P>
<P>
Field rations, now known as MREs or "Meals, Ready-to-Eat," were handed out. 
Cheney missed out on the "patties/pork" and the "stroganoff/beef" and wound up 
with franks and beans and a cup of luminescent green "bug juice." 
</P>
<P>
He squeezed the cold franks from their vacuum-packed wrapping and downed them 
with apparent relish. Actually, there was no relish; rather, that great 
equalizer -- sauce, Tabasco -- was provided. 
</P>
<P>
Then the fun began. A young officer brought out a flip chart, field model, and 
began to brief the SecDef on the Ranger mission. It was all Cheney could do to 
keep from rolling his eyes at a spectacle he suffers all too frequently back at 
the Pentagon. 
</P>
<P>
On the morning he left Hawaii for Seoul, Cheney met with a local foreign 
affairs group and gave his standard speech on the need to maintain strong 
defenses in a time of unpredictable global upheaval. In the question period 
following the talk, an elderly gentleman stood up and reminded Cheney that he'd 
met the future defense secretary in a bar in Sheraton, Wyo., Cheney's home 
state. 
</P>
<P>
"Ummm," said Cheney. 
</P>
<P>
The man said he'd been a Navy duty officer at Pearl Harbor during the Japanese 
attack on Dec. 7, 1941, and asked Cheney for a favor: 
</P>
<P>
"When you get back to Washington, could you tell your boss that next year is 
the 50th anniversary of Pearl Harbor and make sure he gets the date right?" 
</P>
<P>
During the 1988 election campaign, Bush had a little trouble keeping his dates 
straight, referring to a speech he gave on Sept. 7 as marking the anniversary 
of the Japanese attack that brought the United States into World War II. 
</P>
<P>
The South Korean press corps, newly freed from years of rigid government 
control, has adopted a martial arts approach to covering the news. 
</P>
<P>
On arriving in Seoul last Tuesday night, Cheney participated in a brief 
welcoming ceremony with his host, Korean Defense Minister Lee Sang Hoon. The 
Korean camera crews set up about eight feet from the two leaders and then 
elbowed, kneed and body-blocked anyone who got in their way. 
</P>
<P>
A Korean anchorman did live, full-volume commentary during Cheney's remarks, 
nearly drowning out the American official. 
</P>
<P>
The next day, at a joint press conference at the South Korean Defense Ministry, 
the reporters and photographers really got physical, moving rows of chairs 
forward until they were virtually on top of the desk behind which the two 
officials sat. Only a strategic jab with a pen from an American reporter kept a 
Korean photographer from climbing into her lap for a better photo angle. 
</P>
<P>
The South Korean security guards assigned to the press conference could do 
nothing to control the melee. 
</P>
<P>
Astonished at the Koreans' aggressiveness, one American traveling with Cheney 
asked an American diplomat if the South Koreans always operate that way. 
</P>
<P>
"Oh, that was nothing," the experienced Seoul-based U.S. official said. "They 
were on their best behavior." 
</P>
