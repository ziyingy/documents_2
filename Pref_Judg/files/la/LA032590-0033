Regarding the article by Sweet: I'll bet the drug dealers who come before him 
in court feel pretty lucky. Two often used quotations come to mind: "Putting 
the cart before the horse," and "Throwing the baby out with the bathwater." The 
costs of alcohol are a poor track record for legitimizing drugs.
