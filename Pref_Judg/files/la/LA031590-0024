A delegation from Bonn was in Washington earlier this month to discuss 
transferring the Berlin Documents Center to West German control, officials 
said. The center, in the U.S. sector of Berlin, is run by the State Department. 
The United States has agreed in principle to hand over the center after copying 
the documents, said a State Department official. But the Justice Department, 
which prepares court cases against suspected Nazis, is opposed, sources said.
