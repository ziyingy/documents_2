On a clear, blue, ocean-scented morning in Sydney, a day like so many others 
when the sidewalk cafes in Kings Cross have their awnings out for breakfast, 
the joggers are loose in the Royal Botanical Gardens and no one is sleeping 
nearby in a cardboard box, it's possible to see that California is no longer 
the end of the line. The search for the good life and the new life that for 150 
years carried millions of restless Americans across the continent to the West 
Coast has in recent years carried some of them farther, 7,500 miles and 15 
hours by air farther, into the southern hemisphere, to Australia. 
</P>
<P>
Settled 200 years ago by the same stock of Anglo-Irish criminals and political 
dissidents King George III had been shipping off in servitude to the American 
colonies, Australia has always been a distant cousin, both strange and 
familiar. Maligned in the past as a rude wilderness of kangaroos and 
ale-slobbering rugby players, the country has become increasingly attractive to 
Americans as more of them turn their gaze backward in pursuit of happiness. To 
Californians, Australia can look like only yesterday, a thinly populated, 
eucalyptus-lined frontier of manageable cities, unspoiled hills andbeaches far 
from the smog, mini-malls, freeway shoot-outs and desperation of their own lost 
paradise. 
</P>
<P>
A U.S. Consulate official in Sydney estimates that there are 80,000 to 90,000 
Americans living in Australia. Although the consulate doesn't compile such 
statistics, a good percentage of them are known to be Californians, drawn by 
the same visions of adventure, economic opportunity, peace of mind and 
wide-open space that once lured their parents or grandparents to Los Angeles 
and San Francisco. Australia is a country the size of the United States with 
the population (16.5 million) of Southern California. 
</P>
<P>
As recently as 10 years ago, the Australian government was offering to help 
finance passage to its remote island continent for immigrants with proven 
skills -- teachers, doctors and businessmen. Those days are over. Such 
inducements are no longer necessary given the country's rising profile, boosted 
lately by the America's Cup races, the romantic hokum of "Crocodile Dundee" and 
the 1988 Australian Bicentennial celebration. The Australian Consulate in Los 
Angeles receives about 5,000 travel and emigration inquiries a month from 
residents in Arizona, New Mexico and Southern California, the last of which 
accounts for a majority of the 670 immigrant visas it grants each year. 
Although the government still holds seminars in America for wealthy businessmen 
considering migration, for the average person it's not a simple matter to gain 
residency. 
</P>
<P>
Nevertheless, a lot are trying. 
</P>
<P>
Last year, more than 1 million people worldwide applied to immigrate to 
Australia, and the government accepted 140,000, making it just about as easy as 
getting into Harvard. 
</P>
<P>
"It's a comfortable place to get very far away," said Becky Robertson, who 
moved to Sydney this year from San Gabriel with her two young daughters, Sarah 
and Carly, and her husband, John, formerly a software engineer with the Jet 
Propulsion Laboratory in Pasadena. His technical skills landed him a job with 
the Commonwealth Scientific and Industrial Research Organization, a government 
agency, although the application process took a year and a half. 
</P>
<P>
The Robertsons, both in their 30s, went to Australia partly to escape the 
incidents of daily violence in Los Angeles that they felt were hitting closer 
and closer to home. "I feel so much safer here," Becky Robertson said. 
</P>
<P>
"Family issues were one of the main reasons we left," said John Robertson, 
sipping a can of Foster's Lager in their still-undecorated living room. 
"Australia is very family-oriented. I had a negative image of what's going to 
go on in the U.S. in the next five years, and I wanted to protect my family 
from that." 
</P>
<P>
They feel safe enough in their rented $1,200-a-month (in Australian dollars, 
$900 in U.S. dollars), three-bedroom house in the northern suburb of Lane Cove 
not to lock their doors at night. 
</P>
<P>
"It appealed to us," Becky Robertson said, "that everyone said it was 30 years 
behind the times. I was reassured that it wouldn't be considered outmoded to 
stay home with the kids." 
</P>
<P>
She hasn't been disappointed. "You don't get the impression that every kid is 
being shipped off to day care. Here, a woman isn't proving anything to anyone 
by having a career." 
</P>
<P>
Greatly impressed by the friendliness and informality of the people, she 
mentioned that as she was walking to the local shopping center, a motorist 
stopped and offered her a ride. 
</P>
<P>
"God, it's so innocent!" 
</P>
<P>
MORE THAN a few Californians who've taken up residence in Australia make 
comparisons between their adopted land and the California they remember before 
the Watts riots, the influx of millions of political refugees from Latin 
America and Asia, the clogging of the freeways, the pollution of coastal waters 
and the emergence of gangs. So, in spite of Australia's declining standard of 
living -- the result of an ailing economy and an imbalance of trade -- and its 
unfolding pollution and crime problems, expatriates feel as if they've turned 
back the clock. 
</P>
<P>
Standing at the edge of a national park in Noosa Heads, in Queensland, 600 
miles up the coast from Sydney, Los Angeles-born Gordon Clements, stared out 
over the burgeoning town and said, "My parents bought a house in Manhattan 
Beach in 1952 for $9,000. I thought, 'When am I going to be able to afford 
this?' I wanted to live on the beach." 
</P>
<P>
Clements, 36, who looks like the archetypal tanned and blue-eyed California 
surfer, was once co-owner of a delicatessen in Manhattan Beach. He sold out to 
his partner and moved to Australia "on a lark" in 1978. "I remember that first 
day in August I arrived in Noosa. It looked like paradise. The surfing was 
good, the sky was blue, the beer was cold and there were all these naked girls 
on the beach. I thought, 'Why should I leave here?' " 
</P>
<P>
He arranged to return the following year, under a temporary work visa, to coach 
a water polo team at the University of Queensland in Brisbane. Eventually, he 
went to work as a carpenter, at one point hiring out to a construction crew in 
the remote Outback where he ate the famous red dust of the bush and lived in 
military-style barracks. 
</P>
<P>
Today, he supervises a crew of 40 carpenters building hotels and petrol 
stations in Noosa Heads, a developing tropical resort where the ocean 
temperature in the winter is the same as it is in Los Angeles in the summer. He 
has built himself a 2,800-square-foot house near a golf course, where it's not 
uncommon to see kangaroos on the greens. He tells his Australian wife, Joanna, 
"This is what Manhattan Beach was 30 years ago. It's going to grow up around 
us." 
</P>
<P>
A thousand miles across the country in Adelaide, a serene city of Victorian 
parks, cathedral spires and 1 million people that faces the Southern Ocean, Ron 
Somers led the way into his back yard to show off George and Martha, the pet 
wallabies he and his wife bought since resettling six years ago. "We feel like 
we're in a bit of a time warp. It's like California in the '50s," said Somers, 
41, a public-health official who grew up in the Fairfax district and went to 
UCLA. "Kids wear school uniforms. You're not afraid to go out at night. You go 
to a national park here and have the place to yourselves." 
</P>
<P>
Ten years ago, he and his 35-year-old wife, Pam Rachootin, were employees of 
Kaiser-Permanente in Los Angeles, "making good incomes, and we still couldn't 
touch housing." 
</P>
<P>
They left Los Angeles first for Denmark, where both of them worked on a 
three-year grant; then Somers heard about a university research job in 
Adelaide. Neither of them had been to Australia before, but he took the job, 
and Rachootin enrolled in medical school for free (nearly all education in 
Australia is free) and became a physician. Soon after they arrived, the couple 
bought a four-bedroom house with a red-tile roof, half a mile from the beach, 
for $80,000 Australian. 
</P>
<P>
"We're living in a more manageable environment here," said Somers, who's since 
moved on to a position with the state of South Australia as a specialist in 
accident prevention. "We've been out of the country for 10 years now, and in 
that time we've seen such changes in Los Angeles that it's become less and less 
of a magnet to draw us back." 
</P>
<P>
"The last time we were back," Rachootin said of their visit to West Los 
Angeles, "we were shocked to see armed guards at our old supermarket." 
</P>
<P>
Although Adelaide is a quiet city of vestigial English character, its physical 
layout, between the ocean and a ridge of golden brown hills, and its mild 
climate are reminiscent of Los Angeles. "After Denmark," Rachootin said, "we 
almost felt like we were going back home when we came here." But emigres from 
the West Coast are surprised when they learn how different the culture really 
is. 
</P>
<P>
"It's a first-world Mexico," said Phil Tripp, a former tour manager for rock 
bands in the United States who now lives in Sydney, a metropolis of 3 million 
spread out on an 18th-Century grid across low hills surrounding one of the 
world's great natural harbors. "It's manana-land. People here don't live to 
work; they work to live." 
</P>
<P>
WALK INTO A clothing store on Oxford Street in Sydney's fashionable Paddington 
district and chances are that no clerk will pounce on you with a phony smile. 
On the other hand, neither is anyone likely to offer much assistance if you 
want to buy something. Order an omelet of green peppers and mushrooms at one of 
those sidewalk cafes in Kings Cross and you might get, without apologies, 
cheese and ham (or was it Spam?). 
</P>
<P>
American tourists can be disconcerted by the Australians' lackadaisical 
attitude toward service, and American businessmen can be dismayed to learn that 
financial success in Australia is still viewed with a touch of disdain. The 
latter is traceable to the country's founders -- downtrodden working-class 
settlers who, in the words of Sydney's best-known playwright and screenwriter, 
David Williamson, "despised success because it could be achieved only by 
ingratiation and betraying your mates." 
</P>
<P>
Costa Mesa restaurateur Dennis Bramnick, 38, and his wife, Cathy, traveled to 
Sydney last year with $1.4 million to open the first of a proposed chain of 
"California Southwest" cuisine restaurants, and found that doing business in 
Australia has required adjusting to its powerful unions, heavy taxes (a rate of 
46% for incomes of $35,000, for instance), inflexible state bureaucracy and 
different work ethic. 
</P>
<P>
"It's a country of Victorian attitudes and archaic laws," Bramnick said over 
lunch at a sunny brasserie on Bayswater Road. He admitted good-naturedly that 
he has done his share of "whingeing," an Aussie term for complaining. 
</P>
<P>
A self-described "loner and adventurer open to new situations," Bramnick had 
hoped to have his first Red Onion restaurant operating by now but was slowed by 
tedious lease negotiations, training a staff and winning reluctant government 
approval to add another American to his payroll. Just as Gordon Clements 
discovered that, with holidays and vacation time, his Australian carpenters 
actually work 43 weeks out of the 52 they are paid for, Bramnick learned that 
Australian waiters don't work for tips (the whole concept is slightly foreign) 
and are paid time and a half on weekends. All Australians, including 
dishwashers, are guaranteed by law a minimum of four weeks' annual paid 
vacation, even in the first year of a job. 
</P>
<P>
Bramnick also has done battle with his Australian chef over how the food is 
going to be prepared. "His attitude is that he knows what Australians want," 
Bramnick said about his chef, whom he sent back to California for additional 
training. "My point is, how can they know what Mexican food is here when 
they've never really had good Mexican food?" 
</P>
<P>
Australians traditionally have been as eager to accept new ideas as they have 
been to cultivate good service. 
</P>
<P>
"You want to say, 'Get your act together. This place could be paradise.' But 
you can't do that. You can't act American and get aggressive." 
</P>
<P>
This is a country, after all, where many people still celebrate Queen 
Elizabeth's birthday. There may be no more glaring example of Australia's 
collective lack of initiative than its continuing failure to declare 
independence from Great Britain, despite widespread uneasiness over its 
Commonwealth status and lingering resentment against the "Pommies," or resident 
English. 
</P>
<P>
But traditions aside, Bramnick remains optimistic that he and other 
Californians can find success. "If you go down to the Circular Quay," he said, 
referring to a section of the waterfront, "and you look at cars and the houses, 
you know people are making a lot of money despite the taxes." 
</P>
<P>
MANUEL NILA, the "Tortilla King" of Sydney, hasn't done too badly for himself. 
Born and reared in East L.A. and a former hairdresser, Nila quit the real 
estate business in Los Angeles 16 years ago and moved to Australia in search of 
something better. "I was bored. I felt I had gone as far as I could go there," 
said the 58-year-old expatriate, who first became aware of Australia while 
working as an Air Force control-tower operator in the South Pacific after World 
War II. 
</P>
<P>
The government helped pay the passage for him, his wife and three children in 
1973. Beginning with one tortilla machine, he launched Senor Nila Mexican Food 
Products, catering primarily to Sydney's handful of Mexican restaurants. Now 
divorced and married to an Australian and living in a hillside home with a pool 
in the northern suburbs, he grosses more than $1 million a year and supervises 
a staff of eight. Senor Nila's logo is a koala squatting on a sombrero. 
</P>
<P>
If Nila wanted to resettle in Australia today, he would have to apply for 
residency status, as Bramnick did, under Australia's business migration 
program. The program requires that an entrepreneur bring at least $500,000 
Australian (and presumably new jobs) into the country. It's one of the four 
main routes to residency still open to foreigners. The others are to marry an 
Australian, possess professional skills deemed desirable by the government 
(such as pastry chef, speech pathologist, cabinetmaker, furniture polisher, 
accountant, plumber) or be recognized as a political refugee. 
</P>
<P>
Joe Wissert got in because of who he is: a well-known record producer who spent 
20 years in Los Angeles working with The Lovin' Spoonful, Boz Scaggs, Earth, 
Wind &amp; Fire and other major artists. Three years ago, he bought a townhouse 
in Sydney's quaint, leafy Woollahra district and began recording Australian 
performers such as Ganggajang, Cal and Raging Waters. 
</P>
<P>
"I felt things were becoming kind of staid for me. I felt I needed a change," 
Wissert said one morning in Sydney, surrounded by his collection of big, bright 
contemporary oil paintings. "I've always been looking for new ideas, new places 
to be. I had an interest in the country on a lot of different levels and got 
excited when I found out there's a lot going on in music here that's not really 
getting out. 
</P>
<P>
"There was certainly the ecological aspect of things -- the life style. I 
didn't want my children to wake up in the middle of the night with nightmares. 
And I certainly didn't want to go to New York. I almost went to Nashville." 
</P>
<P>
Wissert, 42, said he has gained a new perspective on the world and his own 
business by relocating. 
</P>
<P>
"Going into the clubs, there isn't so much of a scene as in L.A., where, if you 
go to see a band, there are 100 attorneys and 100 publicists. We live on a 
smaller scale. Not that it isn't as competitive in a certain way, but there 
isn't all that hype. I think when they opened up the Hard Rock Cafe here, they 
tried to present a bit of that (status-mongering), and it didn't really work. 
Here, even if you have a Top 10 record, you have to wait in line like anybody 
else." 
</P>
<P>
In Wissert's profession, the migration traditionally has been in the opposite 
direction. But he said, "People don't realize they have such a great country 
here. They tend to ask me, 'Why did you come here from the States?' And I say, 
well, 'If you were born in America, then you'd look at it differently.' " 
</P>
<P>
Phil Tripp, another refugee from American rock 'n' roll, liked the country so 
much after sailing into Sydney Harbor on an ocean liner in 1980 that he has 
become an Australian citizen and a defender of its "no worries, mate" level of 
ambition. 
</P>
<P>
"I love the people in Australia," he said, leaning back in a desk chair at his 
home/office in Sydney's scruffy Chippendale district. "They're not pretentious. 
They're honest and they're lazy." 
</P>
<P>
An Army brat from the South who moved to Malibu after he entered the music 
business, Tripp spent eight years as a production assistant and tour manager 
with rock performers such as Stevie Wonder and Rick James and helped produce 
campaign concerts for Jimmy Carter the year he lost the presidency to Ronald 
Reagan. That same year, Tripp decided that he no longer wanted to live in the 
United States. 
</P>
<P>
"The last straw was the Rick James tour in 1980, when we had a shooting in the 
audience," said Tripp, a beefy, rhapsodic man of 38 who now promotes and 
manages bands in Sydney. "The cocaine, the guns, the whole racial thing -- it 
all just jelled at that one concert. I began making a study of all the 
countries in the world I could move to. I wanted a country that had no nuclear 
anything." 
</P>
<P>
His research led him to Australia, an English-speaking democracy at a safer 
distance from the United States (and warmer) than Canada and with a similarly 
insignificant military establishment and strict gun laws. 
</P>
<P>
The murder rate in Australia is 1.77 per 100,000, or about 283 homicides 
nationwide in one year, contrasted with the 832 murders recorded last year in 
the city of Los Angeles alone. 
</P>
<P>
"There's tremendous personal freedom here," Tripp said, reaching for his 
wallet. He pulled out his driver's license and displayed it. It was a plain 
piece of paper with a few numbers on it but with no picture or other personal 
data. "The government is big, but it's unobtrusive. 
</P>
<P>
"The thing about America is to be bigger and better. Here, it's laid-back and 
classless. Being here made me realize how performance had always dictated my 
sense of who I was. In Australia, I found my spirituality. In America, I never 
had time to." 
</P>
<P>
Of the many virtues Tripp has found in Australia's welfare state, he ranks none 
higher than the national health insurance, which costs its citizens a little 
more than 1% of their gross income. "I had a heart attack two years ago. I was 
in the hospital for 10 days, and it cost me $180." 
</P>
<P>
TO THE NEW arrival from California, Australia offers its own array of 
head-scratching contradictions, beginning with a political terminology that 
defines its Liberal Party as the equivalent of the United States' Republicans. 
But perhaps none of the contradictions is as striking as its street-level 
commitment to egalitarianism and "fairness" combined with its history of racism 
and sexism. Until the early 1970s, immigration was largely restricted to white 
Anglo-Saxons, and the country's treatment of its dark-skinned aborigines was an 
unseemly facsimile of the American neglect of Indians and blacks. 
</P>
<P>
A series of reforms erased the notorious "white Australia" policy and restored 
land rights to the aborigines, improving if not ending their longstanding 
impoverishment. Less progress has been made in repairing the nation's lingering 
reputation as an island of old-fashioned male privilege. Women, both natives 
and new arrivals, still complain about the men. 
</P>
<P>
Nancy Falcone, who grew up in Long Beach as the daughter of Mexican and Italian 
parents, moved to Australia in 1971 after meeting an Australian woman who told 
her "there were five men for every woman." "Little did I know what Australian 
men were like," she said with a pinched smile during a conversation outside a 
nightclub in Byron Bay, a surfing town of 18,000 people south of Brisbane on 
the central coast. 
</P>
<P>
Falcone, 43, a waitress and cashier, has found much to admire about the country 
("It's still acceptable to roam around here; you don't have to do the same 
thing for 20 years") but does not count the men among its assets. 
</P>
<P>
Asked what she missed about California, she answered, "I miss how well-mannered 
the men are and all the grade-A junk food -- Mexican food that tastes good and 
Reese's Peanut Butter Cups. It's too 'WASPy' here." 
</P>
<P>
Pat Woolley, also 43 and single, a Sydney book publisher and a graduate of 
Hollywood High, offered a different account of the storied male chauvinism. 
"The men are friendlier, less restrained from saying what they really think," 
she said. "They're less polite. There's terrible sexism, but there is in 
America, too. It's not that different." 
</P>
<P>
Woolley, who moved to Australia from Los Angeles in 1970 partly in reaction to 
the Manson murders, preferred to talk about the political education she has 
received and the global perspective she has gained while living in Sydney. 
</P>
<P>
"My parents were Republicans. I never thought about socialism or communism. It 
just wasn't talked about. Here, I found that people talked about what these 
things mean. I'm 'left' now. I'd vote for the Labor Party if I could vote." 
</P>
<P>
Her company, Wild and Woolley, begun in 1974 in partnership with Australian 
novelist Michael Wilding, publishes new Australian fiction and serious 
nonfiction. 
</P>
<P>
"Americans in the book trade don't look beyond America," Woolley said. "They 
don't see themselves as part of the world." 
</P>
<P>
THE HARDEST thing for Americans to get used to here is the Australian political 
system," said Ric Zuckerman, an associate professor of Russian history at the 
University of Adelaide. "The politicians here are people. The premier of South 
Australia (who is like a state governor) lives in an ordinary neighborhood and 
drives an ordinary car, and you bump into him in the market." 
</P>
<P>
Zuckerman, 44, taught for three years at San Jose State during the mid-'70s but 
lost his job to budget cuts. He was thinking about becoming a librarian when he 
heard about the Adelaide position at a party in Berkeley. "I applied on a 
whim," he said. "I didn't even know where Adelaide was." 
</P>
<P>
Looking up from a desk covered with exam papers he was grading in his 
fourth-floor campus office, the professor recalled: "There was no one in 
Australia at the time who could do this job, but I had a hell of a time getting 
in, so it wasn't easy even then. I underwent a grilling -- there's no other 
word for it -- at the consulate in San Francisco." 
</P>
<P>
Finally awarded his working visa, Zuckerman and his Los Angeles-born wife, 
Lorre, 43, headed for the unknown. "The first year was terrible," he said. "We 
got very homesick." 
</P>
<P>
But after the first year, things began to look up. He found the university, 
which has 8,000 students, to be "as good as most good state universities in the 
States, and we don't have the bottom 20%. We don't have the dregs." 
</P>
<P>
"Our personal lives have been outstanding. We actually have leisure time 
together. We live 15 minutes from the water, and I have a 20-foot boat. If I 
was an academic in California, I'd be lucky to own a rowboat." 
</P>
<P>
His 10-year-old son, Michael, has become a cricket player, "a left-handed spin 
bowler, and he's very good," said his father, an umpire in the same league. 
</P>
<P>
"Australians recognize that the joy of doing something is more important than 
the talent to do it. The concept of amateurism is much greater here than in the 
U.S. There are no athletic scholarships to college, and pro athletes make 
nothing by comparison," Zuckerman said. 
</P>
<P>
The Zuckermans, who also have a 7-year-old daughter, Nicola, are happy in 
Australia but have not given up their American citizenship. Like many 
expatriates, they visit their families every few years and haven't ruled out 
the possibility that they might one day return to the United States. 
</P>
<P>
Others, like Colin Heaney, have already discovered that they can't go home 
again. Heaney, a glass blower of custom vases and tableware, traveled to 
Australia in search of adventure and good surfing after graduating from Pomona 
High School in 1967. He surfed Sydney's beaches, "lived in sheds for years" and 
survived on part-time jobs. 
</P>
<P>
He returned to California in 1972, to Santa Cruz, and began making good money 
selling candles and furniture. But, he said, "as soon as I arrived back in the 
States, I knew I couldn't live there anymore. There were too many people 
mainly. It was just a matter of time until I could get the money together to 
get back." 
</P>
<P>
As he spoke, he was standing barefoot, dressed for work in shorts and a tank 
top. He had just returned from an afternoon surfing break to his cinder-block 
studio on the outskirts of Byron Bay, a former whaling village with inhabitants 
that include retired California surfing heroes Rusty Miller and George 
Greenough. 
</P>
<P>
"I think that happens heaps," Heaney said. "People live here awhile and they 
try to go back, and then they end up back here again." 
</P>
<P>
What he missed when he returned to the United States, he said, was "the slower 
pace of life" he had grown accustomed to in Australia, and the lack of emphasis 
on materialism. 
</P>
<P>
"The money here is never what I could make in California. In California, I 
found that it was easy to impress women with money, but it doesn't impress 
people the same way here." 
</P>
<P>
Now 41, Heaney is married to an Australian he met on a dance floor in Byron 
Bay. They have a daughter, and he's building a house on a piece of beachfront 
property he bought several years ago for $37,000. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm not a patriotic person," he said when asked if he still had any emotional 
attachment to the United States. "I'm not comfortable with the emotions 
associated with patriotism." 
</P>
<P>
Ron Somers, the public-health specialist in Adelaide, had explained the 
giddiness many expatriates experience just after they've made the move: "The 
first few months here, you're on a mental holiday anyway. But eventually, the 
euphoria wears off, and after a few years you can bounce into a depression, 
coming to grips with the reality that there is no place like home and that you 
will never be a native. Weighing the advantages and the disadvantages, I'm 
personally convinced of the advantages. But people go back at all stages." 
</P>
<P>
On one of those clear, blue mornings in Sydney, a visitor from Los Angeles 
fixed on one of the hypnotic harbor views is reminded of what Somers said and 
is tempted to see how long the euphoria might last. Maybe Australia is what 
California used to be, but with kangaroos and socialized medicine instead of 
coyotes and movie moguls. For the Southern Californian who's seen one limo too 
many, Australia can indeed be a comfortable place to get very far away. Here, 
people ride in the front seats of cabs next to the driver. And they call him 
"mate." 
</P>
<P>
But the visitor realizes, too, that moving here would require a bigger 
adjustment than remembering the Liberals are the party on the right and that 
Christmas comes in mid-summer. There is the realization that the flip side of 
Aussie egalitarianism is a leveling suspicion aimed at all who seek to rise 
above the average. The honesty that often sounds so refreshing in conversation 
and political discourse can also bring to mind the many uses of tact. The 
"slower pace of life" is a wonderful idea until you need to get something done. 
</P>
<P>
"I must admit," Heaney said, "I wouldn't mind better service." 
</P>

Then, too, there is the question being asked by a lot of Australians 
themselves: How long can Australia keep out the rest of the world and its 
problems? The welfare state under Labor Prime Minister Bob Hawke is showing 
signs of strain -- declining benefits and increased "privitization" of the 
public sector. Hawke's treasurer, Paul Keating, has warned that the trade 
deficit will turn the country into "a banana republic" unless its citizens can 
compete more vigorously in the world marketplace. In a reflection of what has 
happened in the United States, the cost of living is shooting up, driving 
housing prices in Sydney out of reach of the younger middle class for the first 
time since World War II. Vandalism, however modest compared with the mean 
streets of Los Angeles, is on the rise. Pollution has turned up on some of 
Sydney's beaches. And the non-discriminatory immigration policy has brought in 
substantial numbers of Asians in recent years, reawakening racist fears.

Perhaps the Californians who have gone to Australia and stayed can be expected 
to accentuate the positive. For one reason or another, they're still there. 
They have found something in themselves or in the country that they didn't have 
before, something more important than bad service.

"I think my life has been better here," she said. "I remember when I went back 
for the first time after about three years, and all my friends in Hollywood 
were still waiting by the phone, waiting for something to happen. It made me 
see the difference, and the difference is that I looked beyond America."

She said she realizes that after all these years she has undergone a 
fundamental change.

"There was a time when I'd say, 'That's not the way we'd do it in America.' Now 
I go to America and think, 'That's not the way we'd do it in Australia.' "
