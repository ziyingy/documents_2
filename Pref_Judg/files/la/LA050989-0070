<P>
There are a million people to the south, 2 million to the north and almost 
nobody in between. But the empty expanse of land known as the Tijuana River 
Valley might someday be a 1,000-acre regional park -- a gigantic nature 
preserve open to the public -- if county officials get their way. 
</P>
<P>
No one knows precisely where the park will be or exactly what it will include, 
because the land has not been bought and completion of the project is at least 
20 years away. 
</P>
<P>
But one thing is certain: $10 million was earmarked for the Tijuana River 
Valley in Proposition 70, the state parks bond issue approved by California 
voters last June. County officials, including County Supervisor Brian Bilbray, 
whose district includes the valley, are now figuring out how to spend it. 
</P>
<P>
The money will be used to buy land, primarily in an area bordered by the 
following San Diego streets: Monument Road on the south, 19th Street on the 
west and Sunset Avenue, Servando Avenue and Calle Primera on the north. The 
east end of the park will probably stop just short of Sycamore Road and the San 
Ysidro Sports Field, said Jim Massey, a planner with the county Department of 
Parks and Recreation. 
</P>
<P>
County officials have met with property owners in the area and say they will 
pay market value for the land, then lease it back to the owners. People such as 
Floyd Wirthlin, president of American Sod Farms, will be able to continue their 
businesses, as long as they are compatible with the "passive recreational use" 
the city of San Diego has deemed appropriate for the valley. 
</P>
<P>
"We're not interested in putting in big ball fields," Massey said. "We're 
interested in low-key, very passive recreation activities like bird-watching 
areas, horseback riding and hiking trails." 
</P>
<P>
Wirthlin, whose 300-acre sod farm provides a habitat for birds and other 
wildlife, said there are about 70 property owners in the area, and "basically 
they would like to keep things the way they are." 
</P>
<P>
Most residents welcome the idea of a park, he said, and would probably sell 
their property if appraisers hired by the county came up with "acceptable" 
market value prices for their land. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Endangered Species Live Nearby 
</P>
<P>
The park is meant to preserve the valley's rural atmosphere and to protect 
vegetation along the Tijuana River. Endangered species, including the 
light-footed clapper rail, the California least tern and the California brown 
pelican, live nearby. 
</P>
<P>
"(Our) highest priority is preserving the biological habitat and the 
agricultural character of the valley," Massey said. "Hopefully, we'll have (the 
public) on the property in less than five years." 
</P>
<P>
Bilbray, who grew up in Imperial Beach and played in the Tijuana River Valley 
when he was young, said his motive for wanting to preserve the area is to 
improve public access to parkland and not necessarily to deter development. 
</P>
<P>
"The issue of building there is moot because the city abandoned 
</P>
<P>
about 15 years ago the construction of a flood control channel . . . so the 
ability to build there is very restricted," he said. 
</P>
<P>
"Our point is there is a place for public access in the valley and we want to 
guarantee it. We don't want the public barred with the excuse that it's good 
for the birds. We think we can do both." 
</P>
<P>
Directly to the west of the proposed park boundary lies the Tijuana River 
National Estuarine Sanctuary, a 2,300-acre nature preserve, most of which is 
owned and operated by the U. S. Fish and Wildlife Service and the state 
Department of Parks and Recreation. 
</P>
<P>
"It's dedicated to the preservation of coastal salt marsh habitat, sand dune 
habitat and . . . the trees along the river," said Martin Kenney, a biologist 
with the Fish and Wildlife Service. State and federal wildlife officials hope 
to eventually build trails for hikers there. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Campsites and Golf Course? 
</P>
<P>
Bilbray said he hopes the Tijuana River Valley Regional Park will not only 
extend the estuarine sanctuary's preservation eastward, but also provide more 
recreational use than the federal parkland provides. Among the ideas under 
consideration, he said, are turning the Dairy Mart ponds into fishing lakes and 
adding campsites and a golf course. 
</P>
<P>
Bilbray has spearheaded the drive to create a park out of a patchwork quilt of 
more than 50 parcels of land now owned by the city of San Diego, the federal 
government, various companies, including General Telephone, H. G. Fenton 
Materials, Title Insurance and American Sod, as well as more than a dozen 
individuals. 
</P>
<P>
Several property owners have already contacted the county with offers to sell 
their land. "We would hope to begin acquiring parcels out there within the next 
several months. . . . Some people have certainly expressed an interest, but we 
haven't done any appraisals yet," Massey said. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Concerned About Future 
</P>
<P>
Lane McClelland, who makes furniture out of willow trees in an abandoned dairy 
barn off Monument Road, wanted to buy the land he lives on, but his landlord 
wasn't interested. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm concerned. I'd like to know that this land is preserved even after I'm 
gone," McClelland said. 
</P>
<P>
"I think it's a good idea to have a park in this area. . . . We need a way of 
protecting the wildlife." 
</P>
<P>
In addition to bobcats and coyotes, McClelland said, "we have probably one of 
the greatest concentrations of birds of prey in the country, everything from 
hawks and golden eagles to burrowing owls." 
</P>
<P>
Jack Jones, a retired Navy commander who owns property off Monument Road, 
thinks the park is "a nice idea. Better a park than concrete and steel." But he 
is concerned about the sewage in the river. 
</P>
<P>
Indeed, there are formidable problems to address before the park can be made 
completely accessible to the public, such as the raw sewage that flows into the 
river from Tijuana, the disease-spreading mosquitoes that breed in the stagnant 
sewage and the undocumented workers who cross through the area illegally. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Turns on Funding 
</P>
<P>
Sen. Alan Cranston (D-Calif.) and other federal officials called last month for 
a $192-million sewage treatment plant that would carry Tijuana's waste out to 
sea, but whether or not it is built depends on the availability of funds both 
in Washington and Mexico City. 
</P>
<P>
"The border situation is a major stumbling block," Bilbray said. "It's an area 
that is severely impacted by the immigration and drug-smuggling issues," for 
which, he pointed out, the federal government has responsibility. 
</P>
<P>
Complete public access cannot occur "until there's a secure border situation," 
he said, but he expects the sewage and immigration problems to be addressed 
within five years so people can begin using the park. 
</P>
<P>
"In the long run, government will have to open up the boundaries, which will 
mean no one sneaking through the park, or else they will have to secure the 
border so that immigration is done legally and not through our wildlife 
preserves," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, a master plan for the park is not expected for several years. The 
project was approved by the Board of Supervisors in November. 
</P>
<P>
County officials met once with property owners in March and are planning more 
meetings this summer, said Nancy Nieto, administrative services manager for the 
county parks department. "We have contracted for an appraisal, and we'll be 
getting back the results probably between 90 to 120 days," she said. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
No Development Funds 
</P>
<P>
The county will then contact owners and offer to buy their land. But, before 
any purchases are made, officials said, public hearings will be held. The Board 
of Supervisors must approve any purchase. 
</P>
<P>
"How things will proceed will depend on the dynamics of each acquisition. . . . 
We would deal with each owner separately," Nieto said. 
</P>
<P>
Proposition 70 funds will not pay for all of the acquisition. And no money has 
been set aside for development of the park. 
</P>
<P>
According to the county parks department, more money could be applied for from 
the federal Land and Water Conservation Fund and other sources managed by the 
Coastal Conservancy and the state parks department. 
</P>
<P>
Bilbray compares the project favorably to the proposed San Dieguito River 
Valley Regional Park, a 43-mile-long strip of green that will stretch from Del 
Mar to Julian. 
</P>
<P>
"We'll be able to do it a little faster because we don't have a bunch of rich 
people fighting among themselves," he said. "You can buy a lot more land with 
$10 in the Tijuana River Valley than (you can) in the San Dieguito River 
Valley. We have a lot more problems, but we have more cooperation. It's the 
greatest challenge. 
</P>
<P>
"This is the working man's version of the San Dieguito park. You're talking 
about people living on 4-acre housing estates there. People here are living in 
. . . housing tract projects that have gang problems. You won't recognize the 
valley 10 years from now."
