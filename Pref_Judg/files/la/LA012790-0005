A Newhall teen-ager, described by his victim's mother as a "monster," was 
sentenced to 25 years to life in prison Friday for sexually molesting and 
murdering a 7-year-old neighbor, whose body was found stuffed behind his bed 
three days after she disappeared. 
</P>
<P>
Curtis Cooper, who was 14 when he strangled Sara Nan Hodges in March, will 
probably spend about 10 years in custody because the California Youth Authority 
can retain jurisdiction over him only until he reaches the age of 25. 
</P>
<P>
During an emotional sentencing hearing, Linda Hodges, the victim's mother, 
condemned Cooper's parents for failing to notice early warning signs of his 
emotional problems. 
</P>
<P>
"Although it is impossible to conceive of a human being involved in such a vile 
act, it is hard to believe that this boy never showed any signs before this 
incident," she said, reading from her prepared statement. "I believe that those 
responsible waited far too long to seek help." 
</P>
<P>
Now, she said, she believes Cooper is "a disregarded monster," who cannot be 
rehabilitated and must be kept away from society for as long as possible. She 
said she regrets that the criminal justice system "deems it necessary to give 
youth a second chance at age 25." 
</P>
<P>
"This sentence is just a slap on the hands," Hodges said. "It is important that 
this boy's life be somewhere where he can be kept from committing such an act." 
</P>
<P>
Cooper, a slender youth clad in a gray juvenile hall sweat shirt, sat with his 
eyes closed. His mother, Crystal Cooper, dabbed tears from her eyes. 
</P>
<P>
Crystal Cooper discovered Sara Hodges' decomposing body in her son's bedroom 
last Easter, while trying to track down the source of a foul odor. The body was 
stuffed between a wall and the headboard of his water bed, and Cooper had set 
up a fan to try to blow the smell out the window. 
</P>
<P>
Authorities had been looking for the missing child for three days, using dogs, 
helicopters and mounted-search posses, and Cooper had been one of the first to 
volunteer to help search for her. 
</P>
<P>
Cooper pleaded guilty to murder with a special allegation of sexual assault the 
day his trial was to begin on Nov. 2, 1989. 
</P>
<P>
Deputy Public Defender Barbara Duey, Cooper's attorney, said Cooper wants and 
needs psychiatric therapy. She blamed Florida social service agencies for 
neglecting Cooper's obvious problems, which she said were manifested in his 
unruly behavior. 
</P>
<P>
Duey said Cooper "has been looking for help for years" for his "severe 
emotional problems," but in Florida, he was "shifted from agency to agency" 
without ever receiving appropriate treatment. 
</P>
<P>
Cooper moved to Newhall from Florida -- where he had lived with his father -- 
in February after he had been arrested for a string of petty thefts and 
burglaries. 
</P>
<P>
The Alderbrook Drive house where he lived with his mother was five doors from 
the home of his blonde, blue-eyed victim. The two sometimes went horseback 
riding together. 
</P>
<P>
Duey said Cooper is "very remorseful, has taken responsibility for his actions, 
is well aware of how the incident has impacted the community, and has been 
accepting of his punishment." 
</P>
<P>
But Deputy Dist. Atty. Michelle Rosenblatt pointed out that Cooper "was able to 
sleep for three nights with Sara Hodges behind his bed. How can a person who 
was able to do that be a person with a conscience or remorse?" 
</P>
<P>
She said Cooper planned the murder about a week before it occurred, and had 
planned -- but never carried out -- a similar murder two years earlier, while 
in Florida. 
</P>
<P>
"He had a belief that he had to kill to have sexual relations," said 
Rosenblatt. 
</P>
<P>
Linda Hodges said that the killing has devastated her life and her family. 
</P>
<P>
Four months after his daughter's death, Sara's father, Walter Scott Mann, 36, 
of Ojai, shot and killed himself on her grave at Newhall's Eternal Valley 
Memorial Park after an all-day vigil there.
