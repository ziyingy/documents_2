That baying sound you hear is the sound of the wolf pack in full cry after 
Donald J. Trump. And those little red dots are Trump bleeding into the snow. 
</P>
<P>
How can Trump be wounded, when only yesterday the question was how many 
billions Trump was worth and how much of that fortune would go to his wife, 
Ivana, in the event of a divorce? 
</P>
<P>
Answer: Because, thanks to some of Trump's own financial statements that have 
now surfaced, it's become clear that Trump's assets would be worth little more 
than his debts if he were forced to sell. They might even be worth less than 
his debts, given problems in the Northeastern real estate markets, the Atlantic 
City, N.J., casino business and the airline business, in which Trump's major 
assets lie. 
</P>
<P>
The real question about Trump now isn't what he's worth but whether his empire 
can survive in anything like its current form. 
</P>
<P>
The more Trump postures and screeches about raising $2 billion in cash, about 
selling his Trump Shuttle airline for a preposterous $550 million, about 
selling the Plaza Hotel in New York to the Sultan of Brunei, the more obvious 
it becomes that the man is trying to jawbone his way out of trouble. 
</P>
<P>
But wasn't Trump worth $1.7 billion a year ago, according to Forbes magazine? 
Haven't Fortune and Business Week magazines at one point said he's a 
multibillionaire? Has The Donald somehow dropped billions of dollars in the 
past few months? 
</P>
<P>
Nope. Trump was never worth as much as he claimed to be -- which, depending on 
his mood and the gullibility of his audience, might be $3 billion or $4 billion 
or $5 billion. Declines in the value of Trump's assets have hurt him, but the 
major loss is having the aura of billionairehood stripped away. 
</P>
<P>
Trump, who despite his bombastic public performances is really a very shrewd 
man, realized that there is no law against giving print and television 
journalists completely nonsensical financial statements, and he did that every 
chance he got. 
</P>
<P>
Why? Because Trump's game involves constantly borrowing money. He needs the 
loans to expand, to cover the cash losses on his existing properties and to pay 
for the expensive life he leads. To be able to borrow that way, you have to 
look like you're already rolling in dough. 
</P>
<P>
While misleading the news media is legal, it is against the law to file false 
financial statements with the New Jersey Casino Control Commission, which 
regulates Trump's Castle, Plaza and Taj Mahal casino-hotels. Trump's financial 
statements, while overly optimistic about the value of Trump's assets, provide 
a good starting point from which to figure out his finances. 
</P>
<P>
A colleague of mine at Newsday has gotten hold of Trump's net worth statement 
dated May 31, 1989. The document was obviously drawn up to be submitted to the 
casino commission and is obviously the same document as the "financial 
statement filed with a government agency" that Forbes cites in its recent 
article about Trump. The Forbes version has greater detail than ours. Combine 
that document with cash flow numbers that Business Week got from Trump, and you 
see that he's bleeding badly. 
</P>
<P>
Trump's statement claims that he has a net worth of $1.5 billion. That doesn't 
sound as if he's in trouble until you analyze where the supposed net worth 
actually lies. 
</P>
<P>
Some $1.1 billion of supposed net worth consists of the Plaza and Castle 
casinos and the West Side Yards, a vacant, 76-acre tract on Manhattan's West 
Side. By Trump's valuation, these properties are worth $1.9 billion and carry a 
mere $800 million of debt. 
</P>
<P>
But these supposedly oh-so-valuable properties are cash drains. It's hard to 
see how in today's marketplace (or maybe in any marketplace) they can be worth 
anything like what Trump says they are. 
</P>
<P>
The West Side Yards have to be costing Trump at least $25 million a year in 
interest, real estate taxes and legal fees. And even though the casinos are 
perceived to be very profitable, clauses in the junk bonds Trump used to buy 
the casinos limit his cash take. Sometimes he even has to return money he has 
taken previously. Last year, depending on how you do the math, he either took a 
total of $3 million out of the casinos or put $6 million in. Either way, the 
casinos give Trump a cash trickle, not a cash flow. 
</P>
<P>
Sure, Trump owns a lot of stuff; his assets are probably worth at least $3 
billion. The problem, as my father used to say, is that all his assets are tied 
up in debts. 
</P>
<P>
Start with the May 31, 1989, net worth statement, adjust it for later 
transactions, and Trump seems to owe the world about $3.2 billion. How much are 
his assets worth? It depends on whom you ask. If you take the lower of the 
Business Week or Forbes valuations on any given Trump property, you end up with 
a net worth of little or nothing. 
</P>
<P>
Trump's people, of course, say these valuations are way low. In a recent 
interview, Joseph Silver, Trump's general counsel, brandished appraisals of 
various Trump properties. If you took those appraised values as real values, 
Trump is worth substantially north of $2 billion. Make it close to $3 billion 
if you want to include the new appraisals of the Plaza and the Castle, which 
have miraculously risen about 25% in value since last year despite the casino 
industry's problems in Atlantic City. 
</P>
<P>
It's hard to take appraisals too seriously. Anybody who has ever sold his home 
to his employer as part of a corporate transfer knows that you always get three 
appraisers to value the house: your high-ball appraiser, the company's low-ball 
appraiser and a third appraiser who is actually trying to be fair. Trump, of 
course, is using only his appraiser. 
</P>
<P>
It's too early to wave goodby to The Donald. He may yet find a sucker to pay an 
outrageous price for the Plaza Hotel, or sell his Trump Princess yacht for $115 
million, or get the zoning for the West Side Yards or get New Jersey to adopt 
round-the-clock gambling. But the wolf howls are getting louder. And there's 
more and more of Donald's blood in the snow.
