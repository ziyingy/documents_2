DEAR SOS: Growing up in a terrific Polish family, I have fond memories of my 
Dad's hot borscht soup. Until now, I have searched in vain for a recipe that 
came close to his, but when I tried the concoction at Gorky's Russian Brewery I 
knew I had found my heaven. Please get Gorky's to part with the recipe for 
their potion.

DEAR PHIL: Chef Michael Friedman of Gorky's gladly provided it. This is a 
heart-warming soup to serve with hunks of crusty pumpernickel or rye bread. And 
keep it in mind for informal, serve-yourself entertaining. 
</P>
<P>

Cook 15 minutes longer. Add potato and cook another 15 minutes. Add beets, 
bring to boil. Makes 6 to 8 servings.

Serve with pumpernickel bread and butter.

DEAR SOS: My mother has a great recipe for shrimp rolls but she refuses to part 
with it. Her appetizer is rolled jellyroll style with a cream cheese, shrimp 
and dill filling, then is iced with sour cream. Do you have anything that fits 
that description? 
</P>

<P>
DEAR CINDY: You can make canape rolls for teas, baby showers or receptions by 
using thin white or wheat bread slices and the fillings listed below. 
</P>
<P>
Flatten bread slices with a rolling pin. Add a desired filling and roll 
jellyroll fashion to form a cylinder. The rolls can be frosted with softened, 
seasoned cream cheese or sour cream, or left plain and tied with ribbon. 
</P>
<P>
Otherwise, your best bet is to prepare Frosted Sandwich Loaf, which when sliced 
reveals multiple fillings.
