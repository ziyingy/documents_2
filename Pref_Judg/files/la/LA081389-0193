On Monday, the Costa Mesa Planning Commission will hear arguments for and 
against a proposed 24-bed halfway house for recovering alcoholics and drug 
addicts in the city's College Park neighborhood. The planned expansion of an 
existing six-bed halfway house operated by a father-and-son team, both 
recovering alcoholics, has drawn opposition from nearby residents who fear that 
the facility would attract drunks and homeless people.
