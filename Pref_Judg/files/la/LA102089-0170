Suddenly, Dorothy Otto found herself trapped. The top deck of the Nimitz 
Freeway had her pinned to the bottom deck. It was dark and dirty and hot. "I 
heard other people yelling and moaning for a little while," she said, "but not 
for very long." 
</P>
<P>
Otto, 43, had been heading home, nearing the Cypress exit in her Pontiac, when 
she felt the freeway heave and heard it groan. She knew right away there had 
been an earthquake. As the top deck slammed down, a chunk landed vertically on 
her car. It braced the upper deck at an angle. She thinks that is what saved 
her. 
</P>
<P>
But the earthquake wreckage held her tight. It caught her left foot. She could 
not move. 
</P>
<P>
"I politely called for help for half an hour," she said. "And then I started 
screaming. If you see pictures, you can see where the top tier is kissing the 
lower tier, and it looks like there is not much room in there. 
</P>
<P>
"Well, there isn't." 
</P>
<P>
Somebody, she doesn't know who, heard her screams. "Some wonderful rescue 
workers slaved four hours to cut me free. Those guys went into a place that I 
wouldn't go if you paid me. It was a real scary thing. I didn't think I would 
get out. I heard smashing and banging as they worked. It took four hours of 
really hard work. 
</P>
<P>
"They had to cut the door off the car. They had to cut the floor out of the 
car. 
</P>
<P>
"I don't know anybody's name. I wish I did. There were guys from the Oakland 
neighborhood crawling into the rubble, trying to help anyone. They were really 
putting themselves on the line. They were great." 
</P>
<P>
Otto was taken to Eden Hospital Medical Center in Oakland. "I hurt a lot, but 
I'm in great shape. I'm a very lucky lady. I guess not many people made it who 
were on the lower deck." MARIA NEWMAN
