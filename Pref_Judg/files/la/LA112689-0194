<P>
They have survived war, prison, famine, terrifying voyages across 
pirate-infested seas and long stints in refugee camps. Now, in the land of 
their dreams, thousands of Vietnamese immigrants spend long days hunched over 
sewing machines in suburban sweatshops. 
</P>
<P>
Some earn as little as $1 an hour. Most are glad to get it. 
</P>
<P>
Beside them toil Latino immigrants who have fled impoverished homelands for 
prosperous Southern California, only to land Third World-style jobs here. 
</P>
<P>
Fueled by this influx, at least 400 sewing shops have sprung up in and around 
Orange County's Little Saigon that employ upwards of 5,000 immigrants. In fact, 
the majority of these shop owners are themselves former boat people who have 
been in this country less than five years. 
</P>
<P>
But these tiny businesses are not jewels in a vibrant immigrant economy. 
Federal and state authorities say many are sweatshops where abusive and illegal 
labor practices are rampant. 
</P>
<P>
These suburban sweatshops are tucked into clean new industrial buildings, just 
out of sight of their affluent neighbors, and out of mind of the consumers who 
buy their products in some of the nation's priciest department stores. Seeing 
"Made in U.S.A." labels, most shoppers are utterly unaware that some of these 
garments have been made by immigrants and refugees -- sometimes children -- 
working long hours for a fraction of the minimum wage. 
</P>
<P>
One of those children was a 7-year-old Santa Ana boy who spent hundreds of 
hours helping his mother sew designer clothing in their home for wages that 
averaged about $1.45 an hour, according to labor investigators. 
</P>
<P>
It's not just money but a certain resignation to hardship that keeps these 
immigrants at their sewing machines. Take 46-year-old seamstress Ngoc Pha 
Nguyen. She worked at several sewing shops that cheated and underpaid her. Now 
she earns $4.25 an hour, the California minimum wage. She is deeply, almost 
pathetically, grateful. 
</P>
<P>
It took Nguyen four attempts to escape from Vietnam. Two of her daughters and 
14 other family members didn't make it. "I'm very sad, so when I get to work, I 
forget about it for a while," she said through an interpreter. "If I stay home, 
I look at the family shrine and cry." 
</P>
<P>
Nguyen bends over to stitch the flounces on party dresses -- a tedious task 
performed over and over again under hot lights in a crowded, airless garage. 
The truth is, she hates to sew. But, she says, she is old and can't find a 
better job. 
</P>
<P>
The shop where Nguyen works is paid $6.75 for each dress she stitches. 
Identical dresses of the same label were selling at a South Coast Plaza 
department store for $64 each. 
</P>
<P>
"The people who are really making the big money are the retailers and the 
financiers of the retailers, and some of the manufacturers," said Edna 
Bonacich, a UC Riverside sociology professor studying Asians in the California 
garment industry. "The workers are totally exploited." 
</P>
<P>
Once a backwater in the $6-billion-a-year Los Angeles garment industry, Orange 
County now produces everything from junior knits to inexpensive evening wear. 
But it is a transformation that comes with a price tag of its own. 
</P>
<P>
Authorities warn that these new suburban sweatshop workers -- particularly in 
Orange County, but also in immigrant strongholds throughout Southern California 
-- are becoming the latest victims of an industry that has been nourished by 
cheap immigrant labor for nearly a century. 
</P>
<P>
Far from the downtown Los Angeles garment district where enforcement officials 
know the turf, offenders are hard to catch. And federal and state labor 
officials say that when they do find them, enforcement is often stymied by the 
same dynamics that have kept sweatshops in business for over a century. Owners 
insist they'll go bankrupt if they pay the minimum wage. Workers won't complain 
no matter how bad their treatment because they are undocumented aliens, are 
receiving public assistance or are simply too afraid. And manufacturers have 
few incentives to investigate the conditions under which their products are 
made. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
County Sweatshops 
</P>
<P>
From the outside, Orange County sweatshops bear little resemblance to the ones 
found in dilapidated buildings in teeming garment districts in downtown Los 
Angeles, San Francisco's Chinatown and New York's old Lower East Side. 
</P>
<P>
Most are in brand-new complexes of light industrial buildings, invisible from 
the street. They tend to be located just behind the restaurants and mini-malls 
that line the thoroughfares connecting Garden Grove, Westminster and Santa Ana, 
where about 100,000 Vietnamese immigrants have settled since 1975. 
</P>
<P>
"Sweatshops flourish wherever you have pockets of immigrants," said Allen J. 
Scott, professor of urban and economic geography at UCLA. "It's not just 
happening in Orange County, it's happening in the San Fernando Valley and in 
Long Beach. . . . And there's a big new Korean community growing up around Van 
Nuys. 
</P>
<P>
"What has been happening recently is a decentralization in all directions out 
from the garment district, not only to tap immigrant populations, but also to 
take advantage of the cheaper land," Scott said. 
</P>
<P>
In 1983, Scott did a study of garment subcontractors and found that nearly all 
were located in downtown Los Angeles. He found only two in Orange County. Last 
spring, Bonacich analyzed the ethnic makeup of the state's 4,589 registered 
garment contractors, and found 172 in Orange County. 
</P>
<P>
The owners of 102 of them were Vietnamese; one was Chinese, 11 Latino, and 10 
Korean; 24 were owned by other Asians whose national origin was unclear; and 
the rest were unknown. 
</P>
<P>
Including the 20% to 30% of shops that are unregistered and the scores of 
mini-sweatshops hidden inside single-family homes and garages, Bonacich 
estimates the county now has at least 400 sewing shops. 
</P>
<P>
"We haven't run into a single Vietnamese who's been in business here for more 
than two years, so this seems like a brand-new business for Orange County," 
said Rolene Otero, director of enforcement for the U.S. Department of Labor's 
Wage and Hour Division in Santa Ana. "In the last two years, it's just 
exploded." 
</P>
<P>
But while wages and working conditions in Los Angeles have improved, thanks to 
heavy enforcement, labor abuses in Orange County are widespread, officials 
said. 
</P>
<P>
A recent crackdown spearheaded by Otero found 18 Orange County sweatshops that 
had been violating minimum wage, overtime and child labor laws -- including the 
shops that employed Juana Valladares and Ngoc Pha Nguyen, according to 
documents obtained by The Times under the Freedom of Information Act. So far, 
the shops have been ordered to pay more than $180,000 to at least 220 workers, 
and some cases are still pending, Otero said. 
</P>
<P>
"The extremely low wages across the board in Orange County are not the case in 
Los Angeles," Otero said. "In L.A. you will find $10-an-hour employees. In 
Orange County, we have yet to find a single employee paid any more than the 
minimum wage." 
</P>
<P>
The suburbanization of sweatshops is an outgrowth of the changes that are 
reshaping the garment industry, scholars and officials said. First, foreign 
competition has driven down prices in the domestic sewing industry. Yet, at the 
same time, manufacturers need flexible production capability, because rush 
orders for more of a hot-selling item cannot be filled fast enough overseas. 
</P>
<P>
The solution -- especially in inexpensive clothing, women's and junior wear, 
where fashions change overnight and quality is often second to price and timing 
-- is to subcontract the sewing. This enables manufacturers to quickly shift 
their designs and output to ride out the treacherous market tides -- while 
largely escaping legal responsibility for any labor abuses committed by the 
companies that sew for them, officials and garment industry sources said. 
</P>
<P>
"They've created a Third World labor force here to match the Third World labor 
force with which they're competing abroad," Bonacich said. 
</P>
<P>
"We all need work, and we take anything we can get," said one Vietnamese shop 
owner, adding that she cannot possibly pay her workers the minimum wage because 
the price she gets for finished garments is so low. 
</P>
<P>
Another owner, a former South Vietnamese soldier who had spent years in a 
Communist prison, says he hires workers only part-time since he and his 
relatives do most of the sewing themselves. On a recent afternoon, they were 
stitching elaborate evening jackets and full-length, lined skirts, which he 
said took well over an hour to sew. He said the manufacturer pays about $5 for 
the set. 
</P>
<P>
"If I don't do this, some other contractor will," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Some argue that labor police have never succeeded in crushing sweatshops in the 
past and are unlikely to do so now, because the market demands them. 
</P>
<P>
"If you really tried to enforce immigration and other laws about working 
conditions, in both the garment industry and the electronics industry in 
Southern California, the effect on the economy would be disastrous," Scott 
said. "So the enforcement is symbolic more than it is systematic." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Illegal Economy 
</P>
<P>
On the inside, the suburban sweatshops are little more than garages attached to 
tiny offices. In a typical shop, fluorescent lights beat down on rows of sewing 
machines. Heaps of pre-cut fabric spill out of plastic bags onto cement floors 
littered with scraps of cloth, threads and cigarette butts. Remnants of meals 
linger in odd corners, and the air smells sour. 
</P>
<P>
In many shops owned by Asians, the office decor includes a red-and-gold 
lacquered shrine with an incense holder and a porcelain statue of Than Tai, the 
Vietnamese god of money. Perhaps no less symbolic are the time clocks and 
posters nearby that detail, in English, the California minimum wage and 
overtime laws. They pacify the authorities, but few of the workers can read, 
write or speak English. And the time cards are rarely used to determine wages, 
since most workers are paid by the piece. 
</P>
<P>
Labor abuses persist in part because both shop owners and the workers 
themselves are participants in a vast underground economy. Authorities say the 
sweatshops prey on two particularly vulnerable groups: illegal Latino aliens 
and Southeast Asian refugees who work illegally and collect welfare at the same 
time. 
</P>
<P>
"They abuse these people, and they know they can get away with it, because 
they're illegal," Otero said. 
</P>
<P>
"My former boss used to pay us 10 cents a piece for ironing," said Maria Del 
Pilar Solano, 23, a sweatshop worker who has since applied for immigration 
amnesty and is not receiving public assistance. "We would work from 7 a.m. to 8 
p.m. We got $8 or $9 a day, sometimes $4 or $5. At the end of the week we would 
add it up and we would get only $50 a week. The owner used to say it was a lot 
of money." 
</P>
<P>
And to Solano, it was a lot of money. In her native Mexico, where she worked as 
a knitter, she earned $12 every two weeks. 
</P>
<P>
Federal inspectors raided the shop where Solano worked and found that it had 
been paying less than the minimum wage and had illegally employed 12 home 
workers, federal documents show. The garments Solano and her colleagues made 
were sold to Macy's and Bloomingdale's departments stores, documents show. 
(Solano said the shop has since changed hands and is now paying $4.25 an hour.) 
Even some of the immigrants who have working papers accept between $1 and $3 an 
hour because they have no skills, speak no English, and are often desperate to 
earn money to send back home, authorities and Vietnamese community leaders 
said. 
</P>
<P>
"In Vietnam, for $10, one person can live for a month," said Ly (Louis) Cao of 
Vietnamese Community of Orange County Inc. in Santa Ana, which provides 
retraining for scores of refugees who are in the garment industry but want 
better jobs. "Ninety-nine percent send money home." 
</P>
<P>
Some of these new Americans are also willing to stay in the sweatshops or 
stitch at home in secret for a fraction of the minimum wage because they are 
collecting welfare, housing subsidies or food stamps, authorities said. 
</P>
<P>
In the world of sweatshops, where wages are paid in cash, and records, where 
they exist, are sketchy, it's tricky to identify the true victims, authorities 
say. 
</P>
<P>
The proprietor of one foundering shop in the Euclid Business Center in Garden 
Grove, $3,000 behind on his rent, stunned his landlord by coming in to pay the 
entire sum in cash -- in $5 bills. And state welfare fraud inspectors tell of 
refugees who, by putting every family member to work, continuing to collect 
benefits, living three families to a house and scrimping for years, have 
managed to buy $200,000 homes or businesses of their own -- again, all 
purchased in cash. 
</P>
<P>
"The illegals (Latinos) are the ones who are most exploited," said Van Nguyen, 
a welfare fraud investigator for the Orange County district attorney's office. 
"These people make a lot of money." 
</P>
<P>
But such cash-only operations take a toll. Workers cheated out of their meager 
wages have nowhere to turn. Their bosses are easy marks. "We estimate we're 
probably getting only 10% of the sewing shop robberies reported, because they 
know they're using illegal aliens and they don't want the trouble," said 
Westminster Police Detective Marcus Frank. "I'd say 95% of them are using 
illegal labor in one form or other." 
</P>
<P>
The sight of Anglos asking questions sends owners into panic and workers 
scurrying out the back door. By the time visitors reach the shop door, half of 
the sewing machines are suddenly silent. 
</P>
<P>
"There was one block on Harbor Boulevard in Santa Ana that has a lot of shops," 
said state Deputy Labor Commissioner Craig Cubberly. "We went into one and it 
was like a fire drill. Everybody in all the shops all the way down the block 
started bailing out." 
</P>
<P>
Juana Valladares, who worked in one of those sweatshops, said her bosses would 
say that immigration officials were coming when in fact it was the labor 
inspectors. Once, after she had secured her green card, she told them she no 
longer needed to flee. "They said, 'If you want to keep working here, leave!"' 
</P>
<P>
The Cambodians who run one of the sweatshops in the same complex have been so 
terrorized since the federal labor investigations began that they have locked 
themselves and their workers inside the shop, Maria Solano said. 
</P>
<P>
"The labor inspectors don't know they're in there," Solano reported. "It's hot, 
but it's locked. They go to lunch and they lock the door. They come back in and 
they lock the door." 
</P>
<P>
As she spoke, she gestured over to the parking lot, where several people were 
quickly getting into their cars and leaving. "They saw you," she said. "See, 
there they go." 
</P>
<P>
In that shop, workers earn 10 to 15 cents a piece for sewing, 3 cents for 
trimming the loose threads from a garment, and 5 cents for each garment they 
iron, Solano said. 
</P>
<P>
"An uncle of mine works there," she said. "He makes $10 a day. . . . He's 
looking for a place where he can make more money." 
</P>
<P>
Beds and Bassinets 
</P>
<P>
Even deeper in the shadows are the uncounted workers who assemble garments 
illegally in their homes. 
</P>
<P>
Officials will not even guess at how many there are, but the practice of home 
sewing, both by families and by sweatshop workers who take work home with them 
after hours, is certainly widespread. Nine of the 18 sweatshops cited by Otero 
were employing such illegal home workers. 
</P>
<P>
Danny Lam, who runs a sewing machine shop in Garden Grove, estimates that he 
sells about 20 industrial machines a month to Vietnamese, Cambodian, Laotian, 
Korean and Mexican families who tell him they plan to sew at home. And Lam has 
three competitors in Orange County alone. 
</P>
<P>
The first authorities to notice the burgeoning home sewing industry were Orange 
County welfare fraud inspectors sent to check out tips that some of the 
county's 22,000 refugees who receive public assistance were working on the sly. 
</P>
<P>
"When we go to (their) houses to do welfare fraud investigations, 70 to 80% of 
the time we find sewing machines," said investigator Nguyen. 
</P>
<P>
State inspector Cubberly began accompanying investigator Nguyen and her partner 
on their monthly rounds to search out labor violations. From June, 1987, 
through September, 1989, they raided 66 businesses and 21 homes where welfare 
violations were suspected. Cubberly issued 85 labor citations, assessing nearly 
$45,000 in fines -- including 13 child labor violations involving children aged 
13 to 17. 
</P>
<P>
The secret home sewing machines were found not just in Garden Grove, 
Westminster and Santa Ana, but also in prosperous Anaheim and Orange. 
</P>
<P>
Inspectors found sewing machines in bedrooms, sewing machines jammed in between 
mattresses and bassinets, and sewing machines crammed into airless garages that 
are stuffed with flammable garments and mattresses. Most of the garages are 
padlocked from the outside to protect their contents from prying neighbors and 
fire and zoning inspectors. 
</P>
<P>
At one home in Westminster, they confiscated 757 knit cardigan sweaters, in 
various stages of completion -- enough to fill six large plastic trash bags, 
Nguyen said. The homeowner, who was collecting welfare, "says he's the only one 
working, making $120 a month," she said. 
</P>
<P>
All told, state officials seized 5,022 garments, which were donated to charity, 
Cubberly said. 
</P>
<P>
Men and women who sew in such homes -- and their children -- risk inhaling dust 
and fibers from the heaps of cut fabric in poorly ventilated spaces. 
</P>
<P>
"Eventually, we're going to see tuberculosis, respiratory problems," Otero 
said. 
</P>
<P>
Some of the garments seized in homes or found in factories paying less than the 
minimum wage bear the label of major manufacturers. When called for comment, 
several manufacturers said they had given cut pieces to reputable, 
state-registered contractors to be sewn. Each one vehemently denied any direct 
or indirect knowledge of the sweatshops. 
</P>
<P>
Executives at Chorus Line Inc., a large Los Angeles junior sportswear maker, 
said when they learned one of their contractors was found to have violated 
overtime laws, they even offered to help the government by withholding payments 
to the contractor. 
</P>
<P>
"A lot of times the shops get themselves into trouble and we don't know about 
it," said Chorus Line President Mark Steinman. 
</P>
<P>
J.P. Wolk, controller of Oops of California, a women's and children's dress 
manufacturer with annual sales of $20 million, said he had no idea that his 
goods had been confiscated by state inspectors after they were discovered in a 
home. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm not aware of that. They never talked to me," Wolk said. "As far as I know 
we only deal with reputable contractors. What the contractors do, I have no 
idea." 
</P>
<P>
Wolk said quality control inspectors do keep an eye on the contractors to make 
sure the goods are being sewn properly. 
</P>
<P>
But he added, "I don't have a police force here. It'd be pretty hard to do 
business." 
</P>
<P>
When such operations are discovered, illegal aliens are reported to 
immigration, and welfare frauds are passed along to the district attorney's 
office for prosecution, officials said. The sweatshop owners are fined for each 
state labor violation, and usually are forced to pay the manufacturer back for 
the cost of the confiscated garments. But, state officials said, manufacturers 
are almost never prosecuted. 
</P>
<P>
"You'd have to catch the manufacturer in the house with the garments and the 
machines," said John B. Carter, senior deputy labor commissioner for the state 
Division of Labor Enforcement in Santa Ana. "It's impossible." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
LABOR LAWS 
</P>
<P>
 These are the state and federal labor laws that apply to garment workers: 
</P>
<P>
 Minimum Wage: President Bush recently signed legislation to raise the federal 
minimum wage to $4.25 an hour by 1991, but that move will not affect 
California, where the state-mandated minimum wage is already $4.25 per hour. 
Trainees with no experience may be paid $3.60 an hour for up to 160 hours. 
</P>
<P>
Overtime: Garment workers, like other non-salaried employees, must be paid 
time-and-a-half if they work more than eight hours a day or 40 hours a week. 
</P>
<P>
Home Sewing: Sewing commercially at home is a misdemeanor under California law. 
The state law supersedes federal law, which allows some types of home work but 
prohibits sewing women's garments at home. 
</P>
<P>
Registration: Under the Montoya Act, all garment contractors must register with 
the state and pass a licensing exam that covers all applicable laws. The 1981 
law also requires shops to keep wage and hour records. 
</P>
<P>
Child Labor: Children under 12 may not work. Children ages 12 to 14 may not 
work on school days. All those under 18 must have a permit from their school 
districts, and in any case may not work more than 36 hours per week. 
</P>
