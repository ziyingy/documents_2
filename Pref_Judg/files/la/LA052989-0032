Most married women in their 60s not only desire sex but engage in it an average 
of five times a month, a survey of older women shows.

"The news is good for all of us as we approach our 65th birthdays," said Dr. 
Gloria A. Bachman, a gynecologist at the University of Medicine and Dentistry 
of New Jersey. "We found sex is alive and well in older women."

Bachman, in a report presented last week to the American College of 
Obstetricians and Gynecologists, said 59 older women were surveyed.

It showed that two-thirds of all married women in their 60s, some of them two 
decades past menopause, are sexually active and many enjoy sex as much as they 
did when they were younger.

<P>
Of the women who weren't sexually active, 60% blamed their husbands -- mainly 
citing a lack of interest on the part of their spouses. The husbands, however, 
said the basic reason was impotence or the fear of it.
