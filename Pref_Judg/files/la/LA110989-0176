British Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher said Wednesday that nations can fight 
the threat of global warming by increasing the use of nuclear power and 
allowing free market forces to deal with the problem. 
</P>
<P>
Thatcher said the "greenhouse effect" caused by carbon dioxide emissions poses 
clear dangers to the world. 
</P>
<P>
"We are seeing a vast increase in the amount of carbon dioxide reaching the 
atmosphere," she told General Assembly delegates during a seminar on global 
warming. 
</P>
<P>
"The most pressing task which faces us at the international level is to 
negotiate a framework convention on climate change -- a sort of good conduct 
guide for all nations," she said. 
</P>
<P>
More specific agreements to restrict damage to the climate would then be 
negotiated among nations, she said. 
</P>
<P>
But Thatcher reiterated her government's position that more study of global 
warming is needed before remedies are adopted. 
</P>
<P>
She said Britain will establish a Center for the Prediction of Climate Change, 
which will have advanced computing facilities to predict climate changes. 
</P>
<P>
Thatcher proposed letting market forces work to solve the problem in developed 
countries and the greater use of nuclear power. 
</P>
<P>
She said Britain will spend $158 million to help developing nations preserve 
their rain forests.
