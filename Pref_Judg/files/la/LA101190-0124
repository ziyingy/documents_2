City Councilman Richard Alatorre accused the board of the struggling Southwest 
Museum on Wednesday of being "a very close-knit group" that treats the museum 
as "their personal property" in pushing ahead with a plan to vacate its 
landmark Mt. Washington home. 
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the museum's director said a seismic engineering study of the 
Southwest's dilapidated building confirmed that a reinforced concrete tower 
where most of its collection is stored has structural flaws that could risk the 
destruction of thousands of priceless artifacts in an earthquake. The study was 
done in 1987, however museum officials say it is further proof that they need 
to move. 
</P>
<P>
Alatorre's comments came in the wake of a decision by the museum, disclosed 
Friday, to solicit proposals for a new site. 
</P>
<P>
The museum houses one of the nation's best collections of American Indian art 
and artifacts, but museum officials have said that the facility is in need of 
$2 million in deferred maintenance projects -- including replacement of a 
primitive elevator that carries visitors to the hillside museum from the street 
below. 
</P>
<P>
In an announcement Monday, the museum said it has "nothing specific in terms of 
time or place" for the move, "but decisions will be made relatively soon." 
</P>
<P>
Alatorre, whose district includes the museum and who has been deeply involved 
in museum affairs since 1987, was sharply critical of the abrupt decision by 
the museum board, which he said had been made without consulting community 
groups. 
</P>
<P>
He said the museum decision appeared to ignore details of a pending master plan 
for northeast Los Angeles in which the Southwest Museum has been identified as 
the "cultural anchor" of the Mt. Washington-Highland Park area. Alatorre said 
plans for a light-rail line connecting Pasadena and downtown Los Angeles call 
for a station to be located in Highland Park near the museum. The museum has 
long suffered from an acute parking shortage and lack of freeway access. 
</P>
<P>
Alatorre complained that the museum, which initiated imaginative programs under 
its previous director, Patrick Houlihan, has lost its momentum. Houlihan left 
in a dispute with the board over the pace of the rejuvenation in 1987. 
</P>
<P>
"I think it's stagnant, at best," Alatorre said. 
</P>
<P>
"The real question is what have they done to outreach into the community and I 
say that they've done nothing," he charged. 
</P>
<P>
However, Alatorre ruled out the prospect of a city takeover of the museum 
facility or of financial assistance. 
</P>
<P>
Sources familiar with the museum said it faces an operating loss. 
</P>
<P>
Museum Director Jerome Selmer said the museum does not have an up-to-date 
financial statement because it is in the process of changing the basis of its 
fiscal year. The museum has a 1990 budget of $1.3 million, he said. 
</P>
<P>
In response to Alatorre's comments, Selmer said he and a member of the museum 
board had "discussed the entire situation" with the councilman before public 
disclosure of plans for the museum's future. 
</P>
<P>
Selmer said he did not know how to interpret Alatorre's statement that the 
museum had lost its momentum. 
</P>
<P>
"Our membership is at an all-time high. Our attendance is at an all-time high. 
. . . All of these things are going on continually," Selmer said. "That's not 
something I'd call stagnant." 
</P>
<P>
In an earlier interview, Selmer said the Southwest Museum retained a seismic 
engineer after the 1987 Whittier Narrows earthquake caused damage to some 
pottery in its collection. Sources said employees inside the building when the 
quake struck observed that the tower -- the Italianate museum's most familiar 
architectural feature to motorists on the nearby Pasadena Freeway -- had begun 
to separate from the main building. The tower was added after the main building 
was completed in 1914. 
</P>
<P>
The entire structure, Selmer said, is formed of massive, heavily reinforced 
concrete but the structural connection of the tower to the main building is 
primitive and comparatively weak. 
</P>
<P>
The engineering study found the entire structure safe for occupancy, Selmer 
said. 
</P>
<P>
However, he said that limited space in the tower -- which is used mainly for 
collection storage -- means that artifacts could be tossed around violently in 
a temblor, with the potential for massive damage to irreplaceable materials. 
</P>
<P>
"Although the present building and location have aesthetic and historic value," 
a museum announcement said, "the physical plant does not constitute the 
museum." 
</P>
<P>
The museum has some unreinforced brick interior walls, which made it subject to 
earthquake safety inspection laws passed after the 1987 temblor. However, the 
city Department of Building and Safety said it was not required to inspect the 
museum because of the private engineering study.
