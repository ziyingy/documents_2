The Times reported that results of experiments in the Antarctic show that 
photosynthesis has declined 25% in the top 3 feet of the Antarctic Ocean 
("Study Is Said to Confirm Fears of Damage From Ozone 'Hole,' " Part I, April 
6). Photosynthesis is the start of the earthly food chain. Everything on earth 
is dependent on it -- everything! 
</P>
<P>
The decline in photosynthesis is cause by the increased ultraviolet radiation 
now hitting the Earth, particularly in the Antarctic region. The increased 
radiation is cause by the loss of ozone in the Earth's upper atmosphere, which 
absorbs most the the UV radiation. The loss of the ozone is caused by man-made 
chlorofluorocarbons (CFCs) -- the things we use to make air conditioning work, 
to clean computer chips, and so on. In other words man-made activity is causing 
the destruction of the Earth's food chain.

The article quoted Ted DeLaca, head of the polar programs of the National 
Science Foundation, as saying the findings are "provocative." Provocative? Why 
are scientists always looking for more evidence to confirm the obvious? 
</P>
<P>
It is no longer an overstatement to say that we are flirting with annihilation! 
Is anybody noticing? The limited international agreements to slow our 
production of these destructive chemicals are not enough. 
</P>
<P>
Today two things are needed: an immediate halt to the production of CFCs and 
subsequent steps to begin a man-made replenishment of the ozone that has been 
destroyed. Both can be done, and if we place any value on life on this planet, 
we had better move rapidly.
