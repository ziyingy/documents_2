A cement plant near Gorman, which is under review by state health authorities 
because it burns hazardous waste, has agreed to pay a $5,000 fine for burning 
illegal fuel last fall, Kern County air quality officials said Tuesday.

The penalty settlement between National Cement Co.'s Los Robles plant and the 
Kern County Air Pollution Control District was half the amount originally asked 
by air pollution officials, and far less than the maximum $43,000 that could 
have been assessed.

The company was accused of burning a petroleum-based material known as carbon 
black during a 42-day period last September and October. The company has 
permits to burn hazardous wastes as fuel in its cement-making process, but 
carbon black was not one of its permitted fuels.

A spokesman for the state Department of Health Services said tests showed the 
material apparently did not pose a health hazard to neighbors. But the 
spokesman added that the department is still evaluating broader health concerns 
about the plant's emissions from hazardous waste incineration.
