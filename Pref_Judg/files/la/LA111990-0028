George P. Shultz sauntered by, heading to his office where he is working on his 
memoirs, while Michal Wyganowski and Wojciech Iwanczyk, rising stars in the 
Polish foreign ministry, chatted on a shaded bench at the Hoover Institution. 
</P>
<P>
In an auditorium down a flight of stairs, Edwin Meese III was telling an 
assembled crowd why drugs should never be legalized. Wyganowski, Iwanczyk and 
10 other Polish and Hungarian diplomats could catch up with the former attorney 
general at a dinner that evening. They had another engagement that afternoon 
more relevant to their mission: a seminar about the intricacies of the World 
Bank. 
</P>
<P>
The irony of it all is not lost on anyone involved. The Hoover Institution, a 
think tank renowed for its conservative bent and the primary brain trust for 
President Ronald Reagan, is taking on a new mission -- acting as headmaster to 
a dozen young diplomats from Eastern Europe in a fledgling program designed to 
train them in the ways of modern statecraft. 
</P>
<P>
"We never would have predicted it," said John Raisian, director of the Hoover 
Institution on the Stanford University campus. 
</P>
<P>
Not long ago, many of Hoover's scholars were part of an Administration that 
declared the Soviet Union to be an evil empire. But for the past two months, 
Shultz, physicist Edward Teller and many lesser known yet important architects 
of the Reagan Revolution have lent their talents and expertise to one of the 
more extraordinary examples of the dramatic changes in East-West relations. 
</P>
<P>
"The things that have happened (in Eastern Europe) were the object of our 
policy, and it worked," Hoover fellow Shultz said in matter-of-fact tones, as 
he prepared to get back to work on his papers. 
</P>
<P>
The former secretary of state pointed out that when "you end the Cold War, 
societies come out of their cocoons and there are new problems that need to be 
addressed." 
</P>
<P>
One such problem became evident to Shultz when Jerzy Makarczyk, Poland's deputy 
minister of foreign affairs, told him in February that there was a lack of 
trusted officers in the foreign ministry, and there was no place to train new 
diplomats. Shultz suggested that Poland send some of its promising foreign 
service officers to the Hoover Institution. 
</P>
<P>
With the help of political scientists, free-market economists and former U.S. 
State Department officials, Shultz and the other Hoover fellows are hoping to 
help mold some of the new generation of Eastern European foreign officers and 
perhaps shape policies in those nations. 
</P>
<P>
"If you're going to change things, you've got to start with the young people," 
Shultz said. 
</P>
<P>
In this first group of diplomats-in-training, the oldest is 29, though they all 
have post-graduate degrees. Most worked for their ministries for only a few 
days when they boarded jets bound for California. They never would have gone to 
work for their governments if they still were controlled by the Communist 
Party. As it was, many of them replaced old-line party members. 
</P>
<P>
"We are aware that we are lucky," said Ervin Szucs, 27, one of the four 
Hungarians in the program. When he returns to Budapest next month, he will be 
one of two officers on the U.S. desk responsible for analyzing developments in 
this country. Two other Hungarians are private secretaries to their foreign 
minister. The fourth, a lawyer, will work in the legal affairs department. 
</P>
<P>
The diplomats have high aspirations. Some hope to become ambassadors. One spoke 
of running for a parliamentary seat one day. Some may stay in the ministries 
for only a few years, then become capitalists. None is certain what is in store 
for them or their countries. 
</P>
<P>
"It's not like a well-established institution," Wyganowski, 29, said of the 
Polish foreign ministry. "The country has been through hell. You don't know 
what will happen." 
</P>
<P>
Hoover scholars have high hopes for their proteges. "These are people who will 
percolate up in their systems," said economist Charles McLure, a tax specialist 
who served in Reagan's Treasury Department. "Twenty years from now, you may 
have high-ranking Polish or Hungarian officials who went through this program." 
</P>
<P>
Early in the program, McLure noticed that one of them bought a telephone. 
Simple though that act was, such a purchase in any Eastern European country 
could have taken months or years. 
</P>
<P>
"These lessons are not lost on them," he said. "There is an interplay between 
economic freedom and political freedom. They are not divorced. We're not 
teaching it. But I think they are seeing it." 
</P>
<P>
They have been serious students, learning quickly the basics of free market 
economies that were unknown in their countries. They have sat through dozens of 
lectures on topics ranging from basic economics to the ethics of statecraft, 
global warming and the workings of the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade. 
</P>
<P>
There also has been time for play. McLure took them to Yosemite for a weekend, 
though they talk as much about the grandeur of El Capitan as they do about the 
sleepless night spent in the unheated tent cabin. 
</P>
<P>
Four of the Poles pooled their capital and bought a 1975 Rabbit for $150 and 
have gone on excursions to Santa Cruz and beaches. They have spent time in 
Monterey, gone wine tasting, and last week, took an all-too-short tour of that 
true monument to American consumption, the massive Price Club warehouse store a 
few miles north in Redwood City. 
</P>
<P>
Jacek Sawicz, 27, a specialist on American arms-control policy, studied the 
stereos until he found what he was looking for: a dual cassette model with 
detachable speakers and compact disc player for $189.99, made in Japan. He paid 
cash. 
</P>
<P>
Others left with piles of towels, tennis balls, multicolored underwear and 
Snickers bars in bulk. Wyganowski, 29, bought a watch he long had promised his 
wife. He could have found the same brand in Poland, but it probably would have 
been a counterfeit. 
</P>
<P>
"Here, you're practically sure it's a Seiko," he said. 
</P>
<P>
During their stay, the diplomats lived with Stanford students. Along the way, 
they heard long-standing criticism that Hoover and its scholars, with their 
ties to the Reagan Administration, have a conservative and Republican slant. 
</P>
<P>
These Poles and Hungarians find the criticism somewhat curious. As they see it, 
Reagan was the President who challenged the Soviet Union's dominance over 
Eastern Europe. Hoover provided him with the thinkers who shaped that policy. 
</P>
<P>
Iwanczyk spent the Christmas of 1981 in New York, separated from his father. 
Martial law had been imposed in Poland, and it was the saddest Christmas of his 
life, he said. He remembered how moved he was when Reagan urged people to light 
candles in solidarity with the Polish people. 
</P>
<P>
"I think he's great," Iwanczyk said of Reagan. "To be here, where Shultz is 
still working, is an honor." 
</P>
<P>
Like the other diplomats, Iwanczyk, 28, was drawn to the foreign service by the 
prospect that he could help his nation. A graduate of Warsaw University law 
school, he was working for the Polish airline when he heeded his government's 
appeal for young people to join the ministry. He signed an employment contract 
on Sept. 3, and was bound for the United States on Sept. 16. 
</P>
<P>
"It's a patriotic way to help the country," Iwanczyk said. 
</P>
<P>
Most of them had no idea that Stanford or Hoover existed, let alone that people 
such as Hungarian-born physicist Teller were among its fellows. Teller helped 
persuade Reagan to create the Strategic Defense Initiative. 
</P>
<P>
Though SDI remains controversial here, the Hungarians and Poles believe it 
forced the Soviet military into realizing that it could not compete with the 
United States. That helped bring about changes in the Soviet leadership that 
allowed Eastern European nations to break away, they believe. 
</P>
<P>
Sawicz, the U.S. arms control policy expert, made a point of visiting the 
"father of the H-bomb" to ask him about Star Wars. Teller opened the 
conversation by probing Sawicz's knowledge of SDI. "I passed and he decided to 
talk to me," Sawicz said. 
</P>
<P>
As the program nears its conclusion, goodby dinners have begun. McLure hosted 
one last week. Conversation ranged from the legalization of drugs to American 
light beer -- a liquid that "has nothing to do with beer," one of the 
Hungarians said in disgust. At the end, the McLures served a cake, inscribed 
with the words, "Best wishes to you and your countries." 
</P>
<P>
Hoover director Raisian said he is "virtually certain" that the program will 
continue, though the cost may be pared. Hoover spent $20,000 per student this 
time, funded by about half a dozen corporations and foundations. 
</P>
<P>
"There is a tremendous amount of interest," he said. "Czechoslovakia is calling 
us on a practically weekly basis asking when the next session starts." 
</P>
<P>
When the Eastern Europeans turned to the Hoover Institution for help, there was 
no hesitation. How could there be? Hoover fellow Charles Hill, a top aide to 
Shultz during the Reagan years, pointed out that a founding principle of the 
institution was that "our system works, your's will fail." 
</P>
<P>
"So when it fails, and they come to us and say, 'Help us out,' we can't say, 
'No,' " Hill said. 
</P>
