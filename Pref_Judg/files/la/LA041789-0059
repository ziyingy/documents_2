If police accounts of Ramon Salcido's rampage are correct, relatives and 
colleagues are at greatest risk from the 27-year-old winery worker, according 
to forensic psychiatrists and a psychologist who compiled a profile of the 
suspect for the Sonoma County sheriff. 
</P>
<P>
Strangers face less danger, but after so many killings, Salcido is "capable of 
anything -- capable of suicide, certainly capable of taking another life. . . . 
Anybody who has contact with him is in jeopardy," Sonoma County Sheriff Richard 
Michaelsen told reporters after receiving an assessment of Salcido's likely 
actions from police psychologist H. Wayne Light. 
</P>
<P>
Eventually, Salcido may try to kill himself or force police to kill him. "But 
right now," Michaelsen said, "he's bent on killing other people." 
</P>
<P>
Indeed, Light's description of Salcido as "a time bomb" prompted the sheriff to 
place the suspect's hospitalized daughter and co-worker, as well as his 
father-in-law, former wife and daughter in Fresno under guard. Protection also 
will be provided at the victims' funerals, Michaelsen said. 
</P>
<P>
Light, who works with law enforcement agencies in Northern California, had 
warned authorities after the first five slayings Friday that Salcido also was 
capable of killing the three daughters he had apparently abducted. The next 
day, the bodies of Teresa, 1, and Sofia, 4, were found at a local garbage dump. 
Salcido's 3-year-old daughter, Carmina, was found alive, but with her throat 
cut from ear to ear. 
</P>
<P>
"I really wish I'd been very wrong," Light said. He refused to discuss the 
Salcido profile in more detail than that released by the sheriff. 
</P>
<P>
Psychiatrists, however, describe the person who committed the wine country 
crimes as a rare and exceptionally dangerous blend of two types of killers: 
those who exact vengeance on workplace colleagues, generally suffering from 
paranoia, and those who slaughter their families, generally depressives who 
reveal warning signs of impending violence. 
</P>
<P>
Murderers of colleagues usually kill one or two others at the workplace, then 
stop. They tend to be suspicious and believe in conspiracies against them, 
projecting all the blame for their career problems on others, psychiatrists 
said. 
</P>
<P>
Those who murder their families often then call police and either wait calmly 
for authorities or commit suicide. 
</P>
<P>
But Salcido's travel to multiple locations, his refusal to surrender and his 
use of both a pistol and a knife defy the experts' categories. He is also 
younger than most family mass murderers. And the possibility that he may have 
cashed a check at a local bank after the first round of killings baffles them, 
too. 
</P>
<P>
His apparent history of heavy drinking and drug use also complicate matters, 
psychiatrists said. 
</P>
<P>
The suspect is so frightening that one Orange County psychiatrist who has 
studied murderers asked to remain unidentified in print. "He may be here," the 
psychiatrist said. 
</P>
<P>
Salcido "seems to be some incredible combination," the psychiatrist said. "He's 
acting as though he's quite psychotic and, on the other hand, as though he's 
quite in control of his senses." 
</P>
<P>
Another psychiatrist, Park Dietz of Newport Beach, believes that Salcido 
probably has a list -- in his head or written down -- of intended victims. 
Dietz, who evaluated John Hinckley for the U.S. government after Hinckley shot 
former President Ronald Reagan, said Salcido probably will try to kill all of 
those named on his list. "The most important thing is his mission," Dietz said, 
even more important than protecting himself. 
</P>
<P>
Santa Monica psychiatrist Mark J. Mills agreed. "The general rule is that the 
best history of future behavior is past behavior," Mills said. "This is a guy 
who killed people who are close to him." 
</P>
<P>
Indeed, Mills speculated, some of the slayings may have had little to do with 
revenge. He said Salcido may have killed his daughters because he thought death 
would be better for them than living with the aftermath of their father's 
crimes. 
</P>
<P>
Still, if Salcido believes someone stands in the way of accomplishing his 
goals, that person could well become a victim too, experts agreed. 
</P>
<P>
"I wouldn't want to be the guy who picks him up hitchhiking," Mills said. "Who 
knows what all this has done to his underlying propensity to solve problems 
with violence?" 
</P>
<P>
Light, according to the sheriff, and psychiatrists agreed that anyone who sees 
Salcido should alert authorities and stay away from him. "If he held me 
hostage, I would follow exactly what he told me to do," Mills said. "But 
presumably his daughters did that too and two of them are dead."
