<P>
Orange County's economy, celebrated far and wide as one of the healthiest in 
the world, is beginning to look a little peaked to a small but growing group of 
economists and business people. 
</P>
<P>
Warning signs have been developing for years: an increasingly congested 
transportation system, steadily declining air quality and housing prices that 
are beginning to exclude all but the wealthy. 
</P>
<P>
The latest symptom was identified by Chapman College economist James Doti in 
his prediction last month that the number of manufacturing jobs in Orange 
County would decline this year for the first time ever. His forecast, however, 
is at odds with a state study that predicts a slight increase in manufacturing 
jobs in 1990. 
</P>
<P>
But even if Doti is accurate, a decline in manufacturing jobs does not 
necessarily portend dire consequences for the local economy or even for all 
manufacturing within the county. 
</P>
<P>
Instead, his is one of several voices that is beginning to raise questions 
about the long-range impact on the county of a shrinking manufacturing base. 
Among the concerns: What happens as the county's vaunted economic diversity 
diminishes, and what kind of society will be left if much of the blue-collar 
middle class is driven away? 
</P>
<P>
To be sure, Orange County's economy and its business base still are growing. 
Just recently, for example, aerospace giant Rockwell International announced 
plans to move its corporate offices from El Segundo to Seal Beach, bringing 235 
jobs into the county. And Toshiba Corp. last year said it would spend $9 
million to expand its Irvine electronics plant, creating 145 manufacturing jobs 
by 1992. 
</P>
<P>
Still, more manufacturing jobs are leaving than arriving, Doti maintains, and 
as a result, many of the new businesses coming into the county are simply 
replacing ones that left rather than helping the economy grow. 
</P>
<P>
The county's climate and lifestyle attract corporate executives who set up 
headquarters operations near their homes in Newport Beach and Irvine; its 
central Southern California locale makes it an ideal place for distribution and 
shipping businesses. Even some manufacturers -- especially those in high-tech 
fields, which require a skilled work force -- find the county a desirable 
place. But traditional labor-intensive manufacturers are increasingly finding 
the county a tough place in which to remain competitive. 
</P>
<P>
Their departure -- to other parts of California or to other states -- 
represents a manufacturing drain that could portend a "frightening" economic 
future, says Mark Baldassare, a UCI social ecology professor and local opinion 
pollster. Orange County, he contends, "will become irrelevant to the Southern 
California economy if it continues losing manufacturing jobs." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Litany of Problems 
</P>
<P>
Ask Ray Jensen, owner of Automotive Parts Exchange in Orange. He began moving 
most of his business to Yuma, Ariz., this month. 
</P>
<P>
The move, which will mean the direct loss of 370 jobs if the entire facility is 
relocated, was spurred by a familiar litany of problems: costly labor, 
expensive real estate, stringent regional pollution controls, a congested 
transportation system and housing so expensive that workers are fleeing the 
area. 
</P>
<P>
The county's 3.2% unemployment rate means that skilled manufacturing workers 
are no longer available at a competitive wage, Jensen said. In addition, 
California workers compensation insurance premiums, among the highest in the 
nation, are eating up his profits, as are tougher air quality rules. 
</P>
<P>
By moving to Yuma -- where rents are cheaper and a 25% jobless rate provides a 
plentiful labor pool -- Jensen figures to save $12,000 a month in operating 
costs. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm a native of Southern California, my family is native and most of my 
workers are natives, so you can imagine how much this move is hurting me," he 
said. But the move means that his business -- remanufacturing automobile 
starters and alternators -- can stay competitive. 
</P>
<P>
By the most conservative measure available, the loss of as many as 370 
manufacturing jobs in the county also means the loss of as many as 237 related 
jobs in retail, service and construction, according to a U.S. Chamber of 
Commerce estimate. 
</P>
<P>
Jensen's company is one of just a trickle of businesses leaving the county. 
Business development experts say that there are in fact more firms moving into 
the county than out of it. The problem, experts say, is that most of the 
newcomers are in service and retail: accountants, lawyers, fast-food 
restaurants, hair salons, clothing stores and consultants. 
</P>
<P>
And that is cause for worry. Service and retail businesses typically pay less, 
produce less and hire far fewer workers than those in manufacturing. 
</P>
<P>
The number of manufacturing jobs as a percentage of the total work force in the 
county has been shrinking steadily since the late 1950s. Then, manufacturing 
provided about 40% of the county's non-farm jobs. Now it represents only 22% of 
the non-agricultural jobs, according to the state Employment Development 
Department. 
</P>
<P>
If Doti is correct and the county now faces an accelerated decline in 
manufacturing, the economy will become even more dependent on service 
industries. "And because the services are also dependent on manufacturing, we 
could lose some of those businesses too," worries Leland Oliver, chairman of 
the Orange County Chamber of Commerce. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Dynamics of Mix 
</P>
<P>
During the past few years, several of the county's largest manufacturing 
employers have left the county: Weiser Lock in Huntington Beach, with 1,100 
workers, and Northrop Corp. in Anaheim, with 1,600 employees. 
</P>
<P>
In a county where 80% of all businesses have 10 or fewer employees, the loss of 
one large employer like Weiser may only be compensated for with the addition of 
dozens of small firms. 
</P>
<P>
Even if Doti's forecast misses the mark on a manufacturing decline, the state 
Employment Development Department's forecast of almost stagnant growth and an 
anticipated drop in higher-skilled manufacturing employment raises two 
significant questions for a county in which manufacturing is becoming less and 
less important in the economic mix: 
</P>
<P>
* Can Orange County maintain a dynamic economy with a shrunken manufacturing 
base? 
</P>
<P>
* And why is manufacturing so critical in what many are calling the 
post-industrial age? 
</P>
<P>
The why has to do with the strong supporting role that manufacturing plays in a 
balanced, healthy economy. 
</P>
<P>
It is true that the total number of businesses in Orange County is at an 
all-time high -- more than 80,000 are in operation this year, according to 
estimates from the county Chamber of Commerce and the privately published 
Contacts Influential business directory. 
</P>
<P>
But it is also true that a lot of those businesses are service companies, 
formed to provide services to other businesses or to individuals: accounting 
and law firms, management consultants, organizational experts, printing and 
copying firms, catering companies, barbers, auto detailers -- the list goes on. 
</P>
<P>
Economists say that manufacturing is the force that drives the economy. 
</P>
<P>
While manufacturing accounts for only about 21% of the gross national product, 
for example, manufactured goods account for 49% of the nation's foreign trade 
income; service industries, by contrast, have a 19% share of foreign trade, 
said Denny Gulino, a spokesman for the National Assn. of Manufacturers. 
</P>
<P>
More support for manufacturing's claim to a major role in the economy comes 
from the U.S. Chamber of Commerce in its 1984 study of the impact of 100 new 
manufacturing jobs on a community. 
</P>
<P>
The study found that 100 new manufacturing jobs create 64 non-manufacturing 
jobs -- 45 in the wholesale and retail trades, including entertainment and 
recreation; seven in transportation, and the remainder in finance, insurance, 
real estate, business repairs and services, construction and public 
administration. 
</P>
<P>
Those 100 new manufacturing jobs also support seven new retail establishments, 
generate more than $2.4 million a year in personal income and account for more 
than $1.8 million a year in local retail sales. 
</P>
<P>
Although the study was done six years ago, chamber officials say it is not 
outdated. If anything, they say, the effects are even greater today than they 
were then. 
</P>
<P>
Thus, by the U.S. Chamber's estimate, the 1,200 manufacturing jobs Doti 
predicts will be lost to the county by the end of 1992 will eliminate nearly 
$30 million a year in personal income and almost $19 million a year in retail 
sales from the county. There will no longer be a demand for almost 90 retail 
stores and about 800 non-manufacturing jobs. 
</P>
<P>
But Doti thinks the chamber's numbers are far too conservative. 
</P>
<P>
Manufacturing workers in Orange County tend to be more skilled and highly paid 
than those in many other areas. And manufacturing firms here tend to be small 
and highly technical. Further, local manufacturers rely heavily on outside 
suppliers for raw materials, product components and such business services as 
payroll preparation, personnel administration and bookkeeping, thus creating 
more need for service businesses than do manufacturers in other areas. 
</P>
<P>
"I would not be at all surprised if the multiplier effect (of manufacturing 
jobs) wasn't more like 2 or 3 to 1," he said. 
</P>
<P>
And that means the impact of each lost manufacturing job could be three to five 
times greater than suggested in the U.S. Chamber of Commerce study. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Regional Upheaval 
</P>
<P>
There are a number of areas, including entire regions, that have switched their 
economic bases from manufacturing to services -- or from services to 
manufacturing -- and survived, but almost all have undergone wrenching economic 
and social upheaval during the transition, said Robert Burchell of the Rutgers 
University Center for Urban Policy Research. 
</P>
<P>
"New Jersey had a significant manufacturing base well into the 1960s, but since 
then has turned around almost exclusively to be a service economy," Burchell 
said. "And what that has wrought, very clearly, is a dual economy. Those who 
can participate with two or more household members working in the service 
economy do fine. But when only one member can participate, they do less well, 
and those who cannot make the transformation from manufacturing to service jobs 
are bringing up the rear with incredibly shrunken incomes." 
</P>
<P>
A healthy business diversity has kept that from happening in Orange County, he 
said. 
</P>
<P>
But manufacturing, the most rapidly shrinking part of the county's economy, has 
always been part of that diversity. 
</P>
<P>
Another region often compared to Orange County is the Boston metropolitan area, 
said Sara Johnson, an economist with DRI/McGraw Hill in Lexington, Mass. 
</P>
<P>
And the economy there is in a shambles right now. 
</P>
<P>
"It probably is time for concern," Johnson said. "When economic growth slows 
across the U.S., boom places like Orange County slow down a lot more 
dramatically than bust places." 
</P>
<P>
There are parallels between Orange County and the Boston area, she said, in the 
growth over the past decade of the service and electronics industries in both 
places. 
</P>
<P>
Extremely low unemployment rates like Orange County's have been experienced in 
Boston as well. Last year, fast-food restaurants and other lower-paying retail 
businesses in that city were importing workers from out of state to help meet 
the demand for employees. 
</P>
<P>
That has since ended, however. 
</P>
<P>
"Now the computer industry has excess capacity and faces a much more 
competitive situation, so companies are no longer enjoying large profit margins 
and are facing more pressures to streamline and cut back," Johnson said. 
</P>
<P>
She said she does not see the problems being as great in Southern California 
"because, in terms of economic growth, the area continues to draw new 
population, and that isn't the case here." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
The Population Factor 
</P>
<P>
But while some parts of Southern California -- especially the Inland Empire, 
Ventura County and the Simi and Antelope valleys -- are drawing new residents, 
Orange County has begun slackening off. 
</P>
<P>
The Chapman College Center for Economic Research forecasts that population 
growth from people moving into Orange County will fall to almost zero this year 
and could well head into negative numbers in 1991 or 1992. 
</P>
<P>
Over the next decade, Doti said, the county's population increase will all be 
accounted for by growth in the under-10 age group. "And they don't buy houses 
or cars or go to restaurants or support many of the services and retail 
businesses" that make up so much of the county's economic base, Doti said. 
</P>
<P>
"We are pushing a big part of the 20- to 35-year-old cohort out of the county 
and into Riverside and San Bernardino," said UCI social ecologist Baldassare. 
"And it is more likely that the jobs will move out to them in the future than 
that they will move back to fill slots that are emptying in Orange County." 
</P>
<P>
Doti holds out hope, however. 
</P>
<P>
Although the county's employment has stopped its rapid growth and although 
manufacturing will shrink, he said, the jobs that remain and that are being 
pulled into the county will be highly skilled and generally well-paid 
corporate, service, research and technical and medical manufacturing. 
</P>
<P>
"And the thing I'm most optimistic about," Doti said, "is the incredible 
opportunity for global trade and Orange County's logical role as the West Coast 
center for the Pacific Rim trade." 
</P>
<P>
But global trade is based on manufactured goods, not consulting and management 
services, said Baldassare, whose research specialty is the changing suburban 
environment. 
</P>
<P>
"The entire state's economic future rests in its ability to conduct 
international trade," he said, "but Orange County will be missing a major 
element without a manufacturing base. It is manufactured goods that will be 
traded to Europe and Asia -- there's just not a big overseas market for 
California attorneys and consultants." 
</P>
<P>
That is conjecture. But there are economic events, "happening right now, that 
are more frightening when you consider the county's future," Baldassare said. 
</P>
<P>
To turn around its manufacturing decline, the county must counter aggressive 
recruiting efforts from other metropolitan areas. Yet the county's major 
outreach tool, the Economic Development Council, has been allowed to die. 
</P>
<P>
"And while other areas are recruiting employers away from us and taking them to 
the Inland Empire and the Central Valley and Arizona," Baldassare said, "we are 
busily trying to find sites outside of Orange County for our airports and jails 
and affordable housing. That's not the kind of thinking that gave us the 
diversity that has made this such a healthy economy." 
</P>
<P>
While jails and airports and low-cost housing developments may be undesirable 
to existing residents in the immediate area, Baldassare said, "they create a 
demand for services and manufactured goods that create jobs for the regional 
economy. By moving such things into Riverside and San Bernardino, we are 
creating a situation that will come back to haunt us." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
THE FUTURE OF MANUFACTURING IN ORANGE COUNTY 
</P>
<P>
Storm clouds on the county's once-golden horizon are prompting some 
manufacturers to seek sunnier business climates. And economic forecasters are 
predicting little or no growth in this vital economic sector over the next few 
years as manufactures flee high labor costs and stringent environmental rules. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
STATE ESTIMATE 
</P>
<P>
The state Employment Development Department predicts that manufacturing in 
Orange County will continue to grow by 2% between 1989 and 1992. 
</P>
<P>
In percentage change, 1989 to 1992 
</P>
<P>
Non-durable goods: +11.2% 
</P>
<P>
Durable goods: -2.3% 
</P>
<P>
TOTAL: +2.0% 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
CHAPMAN ESTIMATE 
</P>
<P>
But economists at Chapman College see a net loss in manufacturing jobs for at 
least the next three years, with a net decline of 0.5%. 
</P>
<P>
In percentage change, 1989 to 1992 
</P>
<P>
Non-durable goods: +8.4% 
</P>
<P>
Durable goods: -3.8% 
</P>
<P>
TOTAL: -0.5% 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
THE PRICE OF RELOCATION 
</P>
<P>
Officials of one large county manufacturing firm that has recently moved to 
Arizona agreed to share the results of their site selection study on the 
condition that the firm, which employed about 1,000, not be identified.
