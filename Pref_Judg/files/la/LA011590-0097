Scientists reported last week they have created mice with a disorder resembling 
sickle cell disease, an advance that may remove a major obstacle to developing 
treatments for the disorder affecting up to 100,000 Americans. A British 
research team said it has genetically engineered a strain of mice to contain 
the defective hemoglobin found in blood cells of humans with sickle cell 
disease.

Hemoglobin is a complex compound responsible for carrying oxygen throughout the 
body.

Reporting in the journal Nature, a team led by Frank Grosveld of Britain's 
National Institute for Medical Research said it was able to create two 
genetically engineered mice containing relatively large amounts of human sickle 
cell hemoglobin in their red blood cells.

In test-tube experiments, blood cells taken from the mice were "sickled" under 
conditions that would cause similar deformities in cells taken from humans with 
sickle cell disease, researchers said. Other tests showed sickling also 
appeared to be occurring naturally within one of the mice. However, the 
researchers pointed out a major problem with their "sickle cell" mice is their 
failure to develop the anemia and other symptoms characteristic of the human 
disorder.
