<P>
It was more than a marriage that broke apart when Tom Hayden and Jane Fonda 
separated in February. Together, they were a movement, a cause, a target. They 
were two whom we knew as one. 
</P>
<P>
So today, nearly two months after Hayden loaded up his faded Volvo station 
wagon and drove away from the couple's Santa Monica home to take up residence 
in an apartment near Westwood, their many loyal friends and employees, their 
colorful ragout of enemies and any number of rank-and-file oglers ask: What of 
this movement, what of these two now? 
</P>
<P>
The short run offers short and incomplete answers. Both Hayden and Fonda can be 
found in familiar roles these days. She as an actress and exercise industry 
doyenne, her career possibilities backed up for as far as she can see; he as a 
state assemblyman with one eye on the Legislature's daily calendar and the 
other on the horizon looking for higher office. 
</P>
<P>
"This is typical. At a time like this, you look for whatever normalcy you can 
in your life," one longtime associate said. 
</P>
<P>
But this is not another garden variety Hollywood parting. Both are churning, 
sometimes at the flash point, with feelings of anger and failure and doubt, 
according to those closest to them. 
</P>
<P>
In the circles in which the two travel, the mood is described as "sad, just 
sad." 
</P>
<P>
Says a friend of Fonda: "This is disturbing to a lot of people. We've all kind 
of grown up with them -- political people, non-political people, even those who 
don't like them. We all look at these things from our own point of view and 
say, my God, if they can't make it after all they've been through, who can?" 
</P>
<P>
For the long run, the separation raises questions that even Hayden and Fonda 
cannot yet answer. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
A Time of Introspection 
</P>
<P>
What chance for reconciliation? What is the likelihood that their estrangement 
will grow bitter, forcing friends and political supporters to choose sides? 
What side would they choose? What will happen to their joint campaign to 
politicize today's generation of young Hollywood celebrities? And what of 
Hayden's future in public service? 
</P>
<P>
"I'm thinking hard, sorting out my emotions and I don't feel the need to 
resolve anything right now," says Hayden, sprawled in a coffee shop booth, 
picking at a late-night vegi-burger. 
</P>
<P>
"For now, there are two things I don't want to give up. Time for my personal 
life, and that cannot be pushed. And I'm reluctant to give up on any of my 
legislative work. I feel I'm coming into my prime." 
</P>
<P>
Hayden is pondering whether to run for the newly established office of 
California insurance commissioner. A statewide poll found him the favorite 
among Democrats for the position, which is to be filled in the 1990 election. 
</P>
<P>
Coincidentally, the top layer of his Southern California political staff has 
moved on to other opportunities, plunging Hayden into a major staff talent 
search. 
</P>
<P>
Among those Hayden has lost are the chief of his Santa Monica legislative 
office, the director of his personal political action committee, known as the 
Hayden Committee, and the executive director of his adjunct grass-roots 
political organization, Campaign California. 
</P>
<P>
Friends say there is no getting around the conclusion that he is "down" and has 
embarked on a top-to-bottom evaluation of his life. 
</P>
<P>
Fonda has worn a game face in public but is "just plowing through her days," 
according to someone known to have her confidence. 
</P>
<P>
"It would be dishonest to say that every day is joyous but it's also dishonest 
to say I'm just plodding along," Fonda said in an interview from her Jane Fonda 
Workout office. "I'm somewhat on a roller coaster. Actually, I feel pretty 
good." 
</P>
<P>
Few matrimonial calamities in recent memory hit home with such force -- 
stirring up the domains of politics and show business, making Page 1 headlines 
in everything from this newspaper to the National Enquirer. At least one news 
columnist found himself mongering gossip; and supermarket tabloids dabbled in 
political analysis. 
</P>
<P>
But mostly, people were not -- and still are not -- sure how to handle the 
private relations between these two extremely public figures who cross so many 
different worlds -- politics, show business, physical fitness, jet set and 
protest, to name some. 
</P>
<P>
Two questions remain unanswered: Did Hayden leave or was he asked to leave? And 
why? 
</P>
<P>
The couple have lived up to a pact to keep this to themselves. 
</P>
<P>
"There are a million stories circulating. It's not like everyone knows the 
story and they can point fingers," says a friend well connected in both 
Hollywood and politics. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Hayden's Autobiography 
</P>
<P>
Along with talk about how they just grew apart, there is speculation now that 
in the course of writing his recent autobiography, "Reunion," Hayden was forced 
to confront a growing sense that in recent years his life was devoid of change. 
</P>
<P>
"The book had a lot to do with this (breakup)," says one friend. "How can it 
not affect you when you sit down and analyze the way you are living your life?" 
</P>
<P>
The book chronicles a life full of changes from civil rights activist, anti-war 
protester, courtroom defendant, from pauper to millionaire, and so on. 
</P>
<P>
Now comes the upheaval, and Hayden is at work writing the epitaph to that 
romance -- a new chapter for the second printing of "Reunion," due out in late 
summer. He says it will cover the separation. 
</P>
<P>
Since separating, Fonda and Hayden have appeared only once at the same public 
function, a pro-choice event at MGM studios in Culver City. 
</P>
<P>
But their son, Troy, 15, has proven a link that keeps them in touch. 
</P>
<P>
"If you realize you are good parents, you know you are good friends and you 
know you're not going to lose everything from 16 years, that's important," says 
Hayden. 
</P>
<P>
A less prying line of inquiry goes to the question of Hollywood and politics. 
</P>
<P>
Nowhere were Fonda and Hayden stronger for being together than in their 
approach to the entertainment community. By personal example and with their 
group called "Network," the calloused politician and the Academy Award winner 
succeeded in drawing Hollywood figures, particularly young ones, into the orbit 
of liberal activism. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Celebrities on the Hustings 
</P>
<P>
In 1986, three busloads of predominantly young celebrities campaigned up the 
highway from San Diego to San Francisco on behalf of an anti-toxics ballot 
proposition. It was said to be the largest mass movement of celebrities behind 
a political issue since the savings bond drives of World War II. 
</P>
<P>
"Every cause needs leadership and a beacon that people can follow," says one 
associate. "I think the Hollywood community has difficulty focusing on things, 
and Tom and Jane played the role of keeping that political light burning. If 
they cannot find a way to keep up the enthusiasm, I think the community will 
lack for leaders." 
</P>
<P>
Others who have been active in the Hayden-Fonda star search believe that enough 
of their work has taken root to survive no matter what happens. "The 
infrastructure will last," says one. 
</P>
<P>
So what of Hayden's political career? 
</P>
<P>
There is no understating how much his marriage meant to his politics. 
</P>
<P>
As a celebrity, Fonda added energy and electricity to his routine political 
appearances, and she opened doors for him into the world of the rich and 
famous. She helped finance his political campaigns. Her exercise business 
provided millions of dollars to build and support his grass-roots organization, 
first called the Campaign for Economic Democracy and now renamed Campaign 
California. 
</P>
<P>
Community property laws being what they are, Hayden is sure to emerge from any 
divorce a wealthy man, to the extent that is a concern. He has established a 
small-donor base of political contributors. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Strength of Connections 
</P>
<P>
But it remains to be seen whether he is well enough connected on his own in the 
Hollywood-liberal circuit to keep the campaign dollars flowing unencumbered by 
special interests. This has always given Hayden special political freedom. But 
one friend worries, "The thing you don't want to do is cross someone as 
powerful and important in Hollywood as Jane Fonda." 
</P>
<P>
As chairman of the Assembly Labor Committee and of a higher education 
subcommittee, Hayden has staked out one of his busiest years ever in the 
Legislature. He is likewise determined to assist California Democratic Party 
Chairman Edmund G. Brown Jr. in trying to expand the voter base for Democrats. 
And he is never far from the debate over where Democrats should go in order to 
win the presidency. 
</P>
<P>
But those closest to him, those dependent on him for their own futures, believe 
there is deeper turmoil below. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Political Speculation 
</P>
<P>
A few think Hayden is so preoccupied with his personal life and that the 
breakup has taken such an emotional toll, that he will be of no mind to risk 
his political career in a 1990 run for insurance commissioner. But just as many 
guess otherwise, that he will emerge with fresh determination not to sit still. 
</P>
<P>
Back at the coffee shop, the hour grows late and Hayden struggles with the 
question himself. 
</P>
<P>
"People must empathize with the fact that we all need time for ourselves now 
and again. If people will allow me the time, and I know they will, and not 
think of it as more than one of those painful times we all go through, then" he 
says, pausing, ". . . then I'll be there. Yes, more than ever." 
</P>
<P>
And what of Jane Fonda and politics? 
</P>
<P>
"I was a political woman before I met Tom. I think I will be a political woman 
the rest of my life. . . . I am much more interested in issues than in 
candidates." 
</P>
