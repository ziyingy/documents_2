A month before the Burmese hold their first multi-party elections in 30 years, 
the hermit-like military government has launched daily attacks on the 
democratic opposition and given clear signs that it has no intention of 
surrendering power, no matter what the results of the voting, Western diplomats 
said Monday. 
</P>
<P>
In a series of interviews, the diplomats said the elections "already are not 
free and fair" because there is no freedom of speech or assembly in Myanmar 
(formerly Burma), and the leaders of the opposition are either in jail or under 
house arrest. 
</P>
<P>
Conceding that there are few meaningful contacts permitted between diplomats 
based in Myanmar and the Burmese people to gauge popular sentiment, one envoy 
nonetheless suggested there is evidence that if the elections were truly free, 
there is "no doubt" that the leading opponent of military rule, the National 
League for Democracy, would win the election for a people's assembly. 
</P>
<P>
The league's leaders, Aung Sang Suu Kyi, the daughter of an independence hero, 
and Tin U, a former army chief of staff, have been under house arrest since 
last July. 
</P>
<P>
The election is being held May 27 for the assembly, whose task will be to draw 
up a new constitution. The military government, known as the Supreme Law and 
Order Restoration Council, has indicated that it will not hand over power until 
a constitution acceptable to the military has been adopted. 
</P>
<P>
The council seized power Sept. 18, 1988, after months of disturbances in which 
troops killed thousands of demonstrators, most of them students. 
</P>
<P>
It quickly changed the official name of Burma to Myanmar. 
</P>
<P>
Diplomats said the government's concern over the strength of the democratic 
parties has been evident in a series of attacks in these closing days of the 
election campaign, stridently condemning politicians as corrupt and incapable 
of governing. 
</P>
<P>
Some opposition figures were released from jail in late April, with the 
apparent hope that they would foment factionalism and splinter the opposition, 
a diplomat said. 
</P>
<P>
The election is being conducted in an atmosphere extraordinary even by the 
ascetic standards of the Myanmar government. Western diplomats are not 
permitted to travel outside the capital. Journalists have been banned for nine 
months, and even Western tourists are being kept out during May. 
</P>
<P>
Between 5,000 and 8,000 people rounded up last summer remain in prison, and 
arbitrary detentions of opposition figures are continuing, according to the 
diplomats. 
</P>
<P>
In recent months, there have been mass relocations of people from Yangon 
(formerly Rangoon) to towns as far as 100 miles away. Diplomats said the forced 
relocations, involving at least 200,000 people in the capital, appear to serve 
the dual purpose of punishing the democracy movement's constituency in the 
lower-middle classes and beautifying the city in a form of instant urban 
renewal. 
</P>
<P>
The diplomats said it is unclear if provision has been made to allow the 
relocated people to vote in their new localities, which are described as being 
Spartan and malarial. The relocations have further embittered the people toward 
the government, they said. 
</P>
<P>
"It's the traditional Burmese belief that the people exist to serve the needs 
and whims of the leadership," commented one envoy. "There is no sense of 
reciprocal obligation." 
</P>
<P>
The diplomats said a personality cult appears to have developed around Maj. Gen 
Khin Nyunt, the chief of military intelligence. 
</P>
<P>
The U.S. Congress is currently considering legislation to ban imports such as 
teak from Myanmar to protest the country's human rights violations and 
involvement with the opium trade. 
</P>
<P>
Melvyn Levitsky, an assistant secretary of state for narcotics matters, 
recently charged during a tour of the area that the Myanmar government had a 
"collusive" relationship with major narcotics dealers, who are shipping more 
than 2,000 tons of opium to America each year. 
</P>
<P>
In an effort to dispel this image, the Myanmar government on Monday held a 
"drug burning" ceremony attended by agents of the U.S. Drug Enforcement 
Administration in which it was claimed that more than $500 million worth of 
seized narcotics was destroyed.
