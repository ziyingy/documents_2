Friends and relatives gathered at the First Unitarian Church in Portland, Ore., 
for a memorial service for Janet Elaine Adkins, 54, who used a controversial 
machine to commit suicide last week in Michigan.

Adkins had planned the joyful, hourlong ceremony before traveling to Michigan, 
where Dr. Jack Kevorkian hooked her up to the suicide machine he invented. She 
touched a button, releasing an anesthetic followed by a lethal injection. 
Seconds later, she was dead. Adkins was suffering from Alzheimer's disease and 
feared mental deterioration.
