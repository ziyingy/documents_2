In one of the first and most far-reaching studies of its kind, Harvard 
University has begun monitoring air quality in Simi Valley and 23 other North 
American communities to investigate the health effects of acid pollutants. 
</P>
<P>
The $3-million project, funded by the U.S. and Canadian governments, will focus 
on whether airborne acids, which come from power plants and automobile exhaust, 
cause respiratory problems in school-age children. 
</P>
<P>
Those pollutants are the same compounds found in acid rain, which is believed 
to harm vegetation and the facades of buildings. The Harvard study, however, 
will focus only on the health effects of acid particles and gases that are 
directly inhaled. 
</P>
<P>

'Some Effects' 
</P>
<P>
"There certainly do seem to be some effects," said Jerry Keeler, project 
manager for the acid study and a research scientist at the Harvard School of 
Public Health. "But past studies are inconclusive. There just hasn't been 
enough work done to definitively answer the question." 
</P>
<P>
Of the communities selected for the project, which is expected to be completed 
in 1991, two-thirds were believed to have air with high acid levels and the 
other one-third were thought to have relatively acid-free air, Keeler said. 
</P>
<P>
Although Ventura County's ozone level is ranked by the federal Environmental 
Protection Agency as fourth worst in the nation, Keeler declined to identify 
Simi Valley's category because he feared skewing the objectivity of the study. 
</P>
<P>
If participants believe that their community is being studied for its clean 
air, he said, they tend to respond to questions in a manner that supports that 
premise. "If they know it's being looked at as a dirty area," Keeler said, 
"then they think, 'Oh, we must be sick.' " 
</P>
<P>
The monitoring of Simi Valley begins today and will continue for a year. 
Special equipment was shipped to the Ventura County Air Pollution Control 
District, which will be paid $6,270 by Harvard to take readings every other 
day. 
</P>
<P>
This fall, questionnaires will be submitted to about 800 Simi Valley 
elementary-school children asking about a range of respiratory-related 
ailments. Young children were selected because they don't smoke cigarettes, 
which could hamper the analysis, Keeler said. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Respiratory Tests 
</P>
<P>
Then, in the spring of 1990, Harvard researchers will conduct respiratory tests 
on any of the children whose parents consent to an exam. 
</P>
<P>
"It may turn out that the Simi Valley area really has very moderate levels and 
isn't as dirty as you would expect," Keeler said. "It's just important not to 
give people a bias beforehand." 
</P>
<P>
The only other California cities included in the study are Monterey and 
Livermore. 
</P>
<P>
If the results indicate that acid particles pose a significant health threat, 
Keeler said, acids might join the five other airborne pollutants that the EPA 
regulates, including ozone, nitrogen dioxide and lead. 
</P>
<P>
Previously, such studies have been conducted primarily in laboratories and 
indicate that acids in large quantities have an acute, immediate health effect, 
he said. However, there is little data on the chronic, long-term effects of 
exposure to such pollutants. 
</P>
<P>
"This is going to be very valuable to Ventura County," said Richard H. Baldwin, 
the county's air pollution control officer. "It will be good to know whether we 
have a problem or not."
