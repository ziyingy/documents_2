A 21-year-old Australian rugby league player died today, one day after 
collapsing in a coma during a match.

Craig Little, a member of the Brisbane Wests clubs, had been connected to a 
life-support system at Royal Brisbane Hospital after he collapsed and fell into 
a coma during a match Sunday.

With about 10 minutes remaining in the match against Redcliffe, Little was 
tackled solidly, striking his head as he hit the ground. He collapsed seconds 
later and fell into a coma almost immediately.
