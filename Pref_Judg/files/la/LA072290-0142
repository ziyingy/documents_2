THE PICTURE being painted for the future is not a pleasant one: dry, 
sand-colored lawns, prickly underfoot, dead from lack of water. Is this, as 
some experts believe, the inevitable fate of lawns in Southern California? 
</P>
<P>
During this fourth year of drought, with reservoirs drying up throughout the 
state, it is crucial to cut back on the use of water. Lawns, considered by many 
to be the thirstiest element in a garden, certainly seem the logical place to 
start. 
</P>
<P>
"It's pretty hard to justify that big slab of green when you run out of water," 
says Santa Barbara nurseryman Ray Sodomka. "The lawn is an easy sacrifice, 
compared to trees and shrubs -- or taking a shower." 
</P>
<P>
Sodomka should know; his lawn has been brown for months. In Santa Barbara -- 
where special pumps are being installed in the reservoirs to suck water from 
the very bottoms -- lawns are as dry and crisp as native grasses. Those who 
tried to keep their lawns alive in early summer found in their mailboxes water 
bills for as much as $500, just one penalty for wasteful water use. 
</P>
<P>
So far, in Southern California, Santa Barbara's case is unique. But many people 
believe it's a preview of California's future: To save precious water, some 
say, Californians will simply have to get rid of their lawns. Incredible 
suggestions are being made as water-saving alternatives. Some seem ridiculous, 
such as filling entire front yards with artificial plants and dyeing lawns 
green. Others sound sublime, such as replacing water-needy plants with 
Mediterranean and California natives that can survive almost entirely on 
natural rainfall. There is talk among city and county officials not only of 
limits on how much area around a home can be planted with turf and of 
"official" plant lists that would mandate which plants can and cannot be grown, 
but of outright bans on lawns. 
</P>
<P>
Although only Santa Barbara has banned the watering of lawns, other areas have 
come up with incentives for cutting back of the amount of lawn in a yard. The 
North Marin County Water District, for instance, offers rebates of as much as 
$300 to those who limit their new lawns to 800 square feet or who tear up their 
existing lawns and plant ground covers, or any other plant for that matter, in 
their place. 
</P>
<P>
Not everyone believes that dooming the lawn -- our symbol of suburbia and the 
good life -- will solve the water shortage or help the environment. "Whenever 
there is a problem, people are told to kill their lawns," says Beth Rogers, of 
Pacific Sod, who is involved in the newly formed Green Industries Council, a 
group representing nurseries, landscape contractors and designers. "We had a 
federal water officer in Northern California say that the sign of a good 
citizen is a dead lawn. Are lawns and gardens that unimportant?" 
</P>
<P>
California's estimated 1.38 million acres of lawn are thought to use the bulk 
of the water applied to the landscape. Studies done by the North Marin County 
Water District indicate that, at least in that region, lawns soak up about 90% 
of all water used outdoors in suburban areas. But researchers at the University 
of California, Riverside, have given us a new, and more complete, water-use 
breakdown for the entire state: Almost 80% of the water in California is used 
for agriculture, 12% by homes and industries and an additional 4% for 
landscapes -- which sounds like a drop in the bucket. In fact, Rogers and other 
lawn defenders consider this an inequitable distribution of water in a state 
that is rapidly becoming more urban than it is agricultural. "We need to 
protect the garden as a priority water use," says Rogers. "Plants are one of 
the few things that mitigate the urban environment. We don't live in a pristine 
natural environment but in an asphalt jungle. Plants are one of the few things 
that make it habitable; they cool and clean our air, hold down dust and runoff, 
and," she adds, "grass does these things better than most plants." 
</P>
<P>
Victor A. Gibeault, University of California Cooperative Extension 
environmental horticulturist at UC Riverside and an authority on turf grasses 
in Southern California, agrees. In an as-yet-unpublished report on California 
turf grass, he writes: "Turf grasses directly influence our immediate 
environment in many positive ways. Actively growing turf grasses have been 
shown to reduce high summer surface temperatures because of transpirational 
cooling. Turf grasses, often with trees, shrubs and ground covers, reduce 
discomforting glare and traffic noise and increase infiltration of water in the 
soil and the water quality." 
</P>
<P>
The actual amount of water that lawns require is also debatable -- not all 
grasses are created equal. "A lot of the information about lawns is not based 
on fact," says Gibeault. "Ten years ago we had no facts. Now we have some, and 
they show that, in Southern California at least, lawns may not use all that 
much more water than other commonly used plants." 
</P>
<P>
The research he is talking about, carried out at the Southcoast Field Test 
Station in Irvine, shows that some lawn grasses can get by on as little water 
as can Australian saltbush, a plant whose very name suggests its ability to 
survive in hostile environments. Common Bermuda grass and the hybrid Bermuda 
named 'Santa Ana' actually outperformed tough ground covers such as various 
saltbushes, yarrow (frequently suggested as a drought-resistant substitute for 
turf) and the rangy O'Connor's legume (a cultivated clover). 
</P>
<P>
Unfortunately, many lawns in Southern California are planted with cool-season 
grasses such as bluegrass and ryegrass. With shallow roots and almost 
unquenchable thirsts, these are not tough or drought resistant. They do not 
spread, and they do most of their growing in winter and spring. Keeping them 
happy during the California summer is nearly impossible. 
</P>
<P>
Gibeault champions warm-season grasses, which grow in the summer and may be 
dormant in winter. Bermuda grass, sometimes called "devil grass" because it's 
so invasive, is the most common, spreading above ground by ever-growing stems 
and underground by far-reaching roots. It is precisely this aggressive behavior 
that makes warm-season-grass lawns tough, and they are naturally 
drought-resistant -- their roots are strong and deep, their blades narrow and 
water-conserving. 
</P>
<P>
"With the warm-season grasses there's an automatic water savings of 20%. Plus 
these grasses can tolerate periods of drought," says Mike Henry, director of 
the Orange County office of Cooperative Extension. "You can reduce the amount 
of water to a level where they compare with all but the most drought-resistant 
plants." 
</P>
<P>
It takes about 38 inches of irrigation or rain to keep bluegrass alive. 
Research shows that only 18 inches of applied irrigation is necessary each year 
to keep warm-season grasses looking their best, but to be only reasonably 
green, they can survive on a mere six inches of irrigation for the whole year. 
These tests show that warm-season grasses can survive minimal watering and 
temporary drought. 
</P>
<P>
"Nobody is addressing the issue: Does it really take more water to keep a lawn 
a moderately green, dense cover than it does to keep some of the alternatives 
being suggested alive?" Henry says. "So far, our tests say no." 
</P>
<P>
Henry and others have found that warm-season grasses are in the same water-use 
ballpark as citrus and deciduous fruit trees and most ground covers. 
</P>
<P>
"It's not true that lawns are using all the water in the garden and that ground 
covers use 80% less. They're actually quite close. The implication is that you 
can save a lot of water if you tear out your lawn, but to tear out a 
Bermuda-grass lawn and replant it with gazanias is a waste of time and will not 
save water," Henry says. "I'm not an advocate of wall-to-wall turf grass, but 
people should make a decision based on facts before they develop a garden that 
is lawn, coyote brush or pansies." 
</P>
<P>
But it is not Bermuda-grass lawns or the tough new university-developed zoysia 
grass that people are planting. The current favorite is tall fescue, a 
cool-season grass that uses quite a bit of water but looks very good. Sold 
under a variety of brand names, such as Marathon, tall fescues were unheard of 
10 years ago but today account for 80% of all sod sales. Homeowners have taken 
to tall fescues not only because they look more like Eastern lawn grasses and 
do not go dormant in winter but also because they've heard that tall fescues 
are deep-rooted and drought-resistant. Which they are, up to a point. 
</P>
<P>
"They have a better range of drought tolerance and can survive the missed 
watering," says Mike Henry. "But they can't survive on 10 inches of water a 
year like the warm-season grasses." 
</P>
<P>
In most cases, these new tall-fescue lawns look better simply because they are 
new, and owners, careful of their investment, are watering them more often. 
It's quite easy to keep a new lawn looking good for three, five, even 10 years, 
but then the soil becomes compacted, thatch (dead grass and runners) begins to 
build up, water begins to run off, and fertility drops. At that point, no 
amount of water is going to make it look good. A lawn of redone Bermuda grass 
or of newly planted warm-season grass would look as good as a new tall-fescue 
lawn but would require less water. 
</P>
<P>
One thing all experts agree on is that midsummer is not the time to make 
radical changeovers. If you are thinking of uprooting your lawn, or a portion 
of it, wait until the cooler weather in the fall, when new plants need less 
frequent watering to become established. Otherwise, you use more water 
beginning a new garden than you would maintaining an established one. 
</P>
<P>
Even without threats from city governments, some gardeners have already said 
their farewells to front lawns, the least used of lawns. "I got sick and tired 
of pushing a lawn mower for almost 80 years," says Robert A. Mitchell of Los 
Angeles, who tore out an aging Bermuda-grass lawn and replaced it with various 
succulents and ground covers, including gazanias and red-apple ice plant, and 
shrubs. "All that mowing, edging, fertilizing and weeding got to me. But I 
finally did it because I think it's important to save water. I think lawns are 
passe now." His new ground covers are irrigated (with the old lawn sprinklers) 
only once every two weeks; the lawn was watered two or three times a week. 
</P>
<P>
A few blocks away, Michael Dula and Alison Sowden deep-sixed their lawn because 
"no matter how much we watered our lawn, it was never enough -- it never looked 
good," Dula says. Rather than redo the lawn and its rusty sprinkler system, 
they planted an attractive collection of drought-resistant ground covers, 
perennials and shrubs. "It started out as an ecological thing but turned into a 
hobby," says Dula, who, with his wife, is now tackling the back yard. Now they 
water every three to four weeks and are convinced that the new plantings are 
"definitely a lot less work and more fun." 
</P>
<P>
A lot of gardeners can sympathize with the Dulas -- very few Southern 
California lawns look all that good. Cooperative Extension researchers found 
that there is about three times as much lawn in the Southern California as 
there should be, considering the amount of water used. In other words, most 
people already are underwatering their lawns. 
</P>
<P>
If this doesn't sound right, it could be because lawns in Southern California 
range from lush green expanses (watered every day with automatic systems) in 
Beverly Hills to the half-dead patches in most neighborhoods. The vast 
difference among climates in California also affects how much water it takes to 
keep a lawn healthy -- obviously lawns in Pacific Palisades require less than 
lawns in Pomona. 
</P>
<P>
Even with all the bad publicity lawns have gotten in the past few years, 
lawnless yards are still the exception to the rule, which seems to be "lots of 
lawn and birch trees," according to Thousand Oaks landscape architect Ken 
Smith. The person who literally wrote the book on water conservation for the 
Los Angeles Department of Water and Power ("40 Ways to Save Water in Your Yard 
and Garden"), Smith designs dozens of gardens every year. Still he has found 
precious few customers for his water-conscious ideas. "Someone finally asked me 
to do a garden with no lawn. They wanted unusual, drought-resistant plants 
instead. It was real exciting," Smith says. "But most clients still want a more 
traditional garden." 
</P>
<P>
It's true that a broad sweep of lawn defines a "traditional" garden. Developers 
know this, which is why some of the most expansive lawn installations can be 
found in or around new subdivisions and commercial developments. In the rapidly 
growing "new" communities from Lancaster to Temecula, bright green sod is as 
prominent as banners and flags on opening day. "People want a landscape now, 
and sod is an instant solution," explains Smith. "And it does have a lot going 
for it -- you can walk on it almost immediately, it stops erosion, holds down 
dust, prevents weeds, and it is easy and inexpensive to install and maintain." 
Unfortunately, most of the new sod around developments is the tall fescue, not 
the warm-season grasses; sprinklers run endlessly and water pours down the 
streets. 
</P>
<P>
But even among developers, there are signs of change. Bob Reed convinced his 
partners to try a lawnless garden in front of one new house in their Riverside 
County tract. "It wasn't easy. All they could think of was cactus and gravel," 
says Reed. Landscape designer John DeForest did use cactus, and gravel, but 
also all kinds of other plants that make the front a fascinating tapestry. "It 
sure looks better than a lawn to my eyes," says Reed. 
</P>
<P>
It isn't just new condo complexes and trendy tracts that commit lawn abuse. 
Lisa Iwata, a San Clemente landscape architect and one of the organizers of the 
annual Southern California Xeriscape Conference, points to lawns that serve no 
purpose as water-wasters -- those around industrial buildings with "Keep Off 
the Grass" signs and lawns in median strips of boulevards. These she calls 
"silly lawns" that should definitely be gotten rid of. 
</P>
<P>
Many homeowners have their own strips of "silly lawn" -- the parkway planting 
between street and sidewalk. Little, narrow strips of lawn like this have been 
outlawed in North Marin County because they are impossible to water 
efficiently. Most city ordinances, however, require that these parkways be 
grass because any other plant would get in the way of an opening car door. 
</P>
<P>
Randall Ismay, primary consultant for Landscape and Water Management 
Consultants in Los Angeles and Laguna Niguel and a strong proponent of 
xeriscape, concurs with Iwata on silly lawns: "What the heck is a lawn doing in 
the middle of the street? Nobody can even walk on it. That's misusing it." 
</P>
<P>
Xeriscape, a term coined by the Denver Water Department in 1980, means water 
conservation through creative landscaping. Says Iwata, "Water-saving gardens 
require more careful thought and planning and initially are more expensive to 
install, but they pay off down the road." Iwata sees xeriscaping as a sensible, 
and necessary, next step for California gardens. "Many think xeriscape means 
you have to get rid of lawns," says Ismay. "Wrong. Xeriscape does not mean no 
more turf; it means we stop abusing and misusing it. Grass is not appropriate 
in the middle of the street. But it certainly is appropriate in parks and in 
play areas -- you can't ask your kids to go play on the coyote brush." That 
tough, drought-resistant, shrubby ground cover would provide an uncomfortable 
play area indeed. 
</P>
<P>
Iwata, in fact, is waiting for autumn's cooler weather to plant a small lawn in 
her own garden so that her 3-year-old has a place to play. Like most of the 
gardens she designs, her own garden is mostly landscaped with native and other 
drought-resistant plants. 
</P>
<P>
"A lot of people think that xeriscape means 'zeroscape,' " she says. "But 
that's not the idea at all. In my garden I have all the plants people think 
they are going to have to give up -- from azaleas to violets, and, in a few 
months, a lawn. But as a whole, the garden uses very little water." 
</P>
<P>
"The ideal xeriscape," Ismay says, "and what we strive for, would use three 
times as many plants while also using less water. The idea is to plant more 
greenery, not less." 
</P>
<P>
Most of those advocating xeriscapes do see lawns as part of the landscape 
picture -- if planted wisely and less frequently. 
</P>
<P>
A key step in solving the lawn-and-water problem is to fine-tune watering and 
irrigation systems. People who water concrete and allow runoff to rush down the 
gutter give lawns a bad name -- concreto no crese ("concrete doesn't grow" in 
Spanish). "Accuracy is the new word in irrigation," says Iwata. "It's extremely 
important to put the right amount in the right place," she says. And help is on 
the way. There are new sprinklers that spray water in a flatter arc, so less is 
scattered to the wind, and that apply it at a lower rate so it can sink in and 
not run off. New automatic timers work in on/off cycles that also give the 
ground time to absorb the water. 
</P>
<P>
Lawn-placement planning can help, too. "It makes no sense to plant lawns in 
narrow areas or on hillsides where it cannot be watered efficiently," says 
Rogers. 
</P>
<P>
Efficient watering is well on its way to becoming a science in Southern 
California. Using new calculations, experts can, for the first time, tell us 
how long to water as well. 
</P>
<P>
By measuring evapotranspiration (ET) rates -- how much water a plant loses to 
the atmosphere during any given period of time -- you can gauge more accurately 
how much, and how often, the plant should be watered. The San Bernardino County 
office of the Cooperative Extension has recently published "The Easy Guide to 
Lawn Watering," which makes ET use easy. The booklet uses what's called 
"historical ET" -- the average month-by-month ET rate for a specific area over 
the past 15 years. This information is gathered by California Irrigation 
Management Information System (CIMIS), a statewide system that monitors ET. 
CIMIS was developed for agriculture, but large urban turf users, such as golf 
courses and parks, are beginning to use it as well. Although home gardeners can 
work only with averages (golf courses and large turf installations can actually 
figure out each day's ET rate), they can still water their lawns more 
efficiently. Not all counties have this information available yet; telephone 
your county's Cooperative Extension office. 
</P>
<P>
It is crucial that we begin taking personal, well-informed water-saving steps. 
In an April Los Angeles Times article, Carl Boronkay, the general manager of 
the giant Metropolitan Water District, said, "This drought is focusing 
attention on the fact that things will be different from now on." Since the MWD 
will be supplying most of Southern California with its water, those are words 
to be heeded. 
</P>
<P>
A few good rainy years may postpone any enforced change in lawns and gardens, 
but regulations seem inevitable. It is possible that there will be a vast 
public outcry, that people will decide that lawns are worth the water they 
consume. They also might demand that the state change the way the water pie is 
divided among agriculture and urban areas. 
</P>
<P>
But it is even more likely that before anybody notices, and before all the 
facts are in, cities will pass ordinances that tell us what we can and cannot 
do in our gardens. "Already, they are planning ordinances all over the place 
telling you what you can and can't plant," Iwata says. "It's very scary." 
</P>
<P>
"When regulation by government extends to your own back yard," adds Ken Smith, 
"that's the last straw. Imagine the bureaucrats you will have to deal with to 
get permits to do anything in your garden." 
</P>
<P>
Most people involved with gardening and horticulture hope that we will steer 
the middle course -- that there will be less lawn in the near future but not no 
lawns -- and they hope that other plants will replace our much-loved grass. The 
worst-case scenario, however, is that when confronted with water restrictions, 
most people will take the easy way out and replace living landscape with 
pavement or gravel, which will add nothing to the urban environment. (In fact, 
this is exactly what's happened, with disastrous results, in true desert cities 
such as Phoenix.) 
</P>
<P>
Better gardeners will most likely discover all the new drought-resistant plants 
being introduced at nurseries, and convert more of their gardens to non-turf 
areas. What lawn remains will be more efficiently irrigated and will probably 
look a lot better. 
</P>
<P>
"I expect to see the end of the lawn as we know it," Iwata says. "Lawns will be 
smaller, more useful." 
</P>
<P>
"We will have to adjust our expectations," Ismay adds. "Gardens are going to be 
different. Not better, not worse, just different." 
</P>
