In his column describing the impact of drug cases upon the judicial system 
("Assembly Line Justice Threatens the Whole System," March 13), State Bar 
President Alan I. Rothenberg correctly states that the flood of drug cases 
threatens the capacity of our legal system to resolve criminal and civil 
disputes. 
</P>
<P>
The Los Angeles Superior Court is already overloaded with criminal cases. 
</P>
<P>
The number of criminal felony matters has increased at an alarming rate, from 
20,420 in 1980 to 51,307 last year, an increase of 151% in just 10 years. 
Although the California Judicial Council says we need 47 more judges just to 
handle our current workload, the state Legislature has turned down our requests 
for additional judgeships and for funds to construct much needed courtroom 
facilities. 
</P>
<P>
Since the law gives criminal cases priority over other matters, we must assign 
many felony cases to judges who ordinarily hear non-criminal cases. This 
judicial juggling act results in a steady decline in the number of judges and 
courtrooms available to hear civil, family law, juvenile, probate and other 
non-criminal cases. 
</P>
<P>
Until lawmakers are willing to take decisive action, the Los Angeles Superior 
Court will continue to be buried in the avalanche of drug and other felony 
cases to the detriment of law-abiding litigants with civil and other matters.
