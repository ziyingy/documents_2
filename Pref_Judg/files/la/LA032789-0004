A careful reading of Stammer's excellent stories from London on the 
international meeting to deal with new atmospheric ozone problems suggests that 
U.S. and world environmentalists have their work cut out for them in persuading 
world leaders, including President Bush, to stop pouring chlorofluorocarbons 
and halons into the air. 
</P>
<P>
Bush's endorsement of speeding-up the phase-out of ozone-destroying chemicals 
contained a giant loophole -- a ban on CFCs by the turn of the century "if safe 
alternatives can be developed." 
</P>
<P>
This is a naive and totally misleading view. The world has no alternatives. All 
nations must end the use of CFCs and halons (a chemical used in fire 
suppressants) or face a health-threatening and environmental-threatening global 
disaster. 
</P>
<P>
The destruction of the ozone shield by industrial chemicals is now an 
established, proven scientific fact. 
</P>
<P>
Stammer reported that recent findings by scientists show "there are enough 
chemical pollutants in the Arctic to deplete the ozone layer there at the 
staggering rate of 1% a day if climatic conditions are right." 
</P>
<P>
President Bush's wishy-washy "support" for a ban on ozone destroyers will not 
persuade Third World foot draggers to go along with the industrialized world 
when their economic development is at stake. 
</P>
<P>
U.S. Environmental Protection Agency Administrator William K. Reilly, who knows 
the score on chlorofluorocarbons, is going to have to assemble our top 
atmospheric scientists and go have a talk with Bush. 
</P>
<P>
The U.S. and Europe must lead the way on this issue. It's a matter of life and 
death.
