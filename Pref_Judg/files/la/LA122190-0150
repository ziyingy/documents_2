It was snowing in Surf City this morning. 
</P>
<P>
Some light flakes, spawned by a frigid upper-level storm system, also drifted 
onto neighboring Seal Beach. Weather forecasters said the snow will end today 
-- the first day of winter -- but the cold will continue and become even colder 
over the weekend. 
</P>
<P>
The unusual snow in the Seal Beach-Huntington Beach area was very light, very 
scattered and did not stick. But the sight of the tiny flakes blowing in the 
cold ocean wind caused excitement and wonder. 
</P>
<P>
Civic Center workers in Huntington Beach exchanged snow stories. 
</P>
<P>
Children ran outside their homes and cheered, according to one resident in the 
northern section of this city of 180,000. 
</P>
<P>
Snow flurries were also reported this morning in Costa Mesa and along the 
Ortega Highway at elevations of 1,800 feet. 
</P>
<P>
The rare event for the beach cities was all the more remarkable, observers 
said, because Huntington Beach, a historic surfing mecca, usually advertises 
itself as a balmy, sun-drenched coastal resort. 
</P>
<P>
But instead of sun-tanned bodies on the beach, city lifeguards this morning 
were reporting a light frosting of snowflakes on cars and streets near the 
city's famed pier.

"I was down at the Grinder (on Pacific Coast Highway) having breakfast this 
morning, and when I came out, I thought someone was having a dandruff problem," 
said Kai Weisser, 31, a marine safety officer. 
</P>
<P>
"There was snow on the ground. It was a very small amount, but it was 
definitely snow. This was about quarter after nine this morning. I've lived 
here since I was 4 years old, and I couldn't believe it. I've seen hail here 
before, but never snow." 
</P>
<P>
Snow was seen in Seal Beach between 8:30 a.m. and 9 a.m. 
</P>
<P>
"I walked outside, and I have a dark sweater on and there were a bunch of white 
things on it," said Kerry Kyle, a receptionist at Seal Beach City Hall. 
</P>
<P>
"There were little white snowflakes out there," said Suzi Henricks, a waitress 
at Ruby's on the end of the Seal Beach pier. 
</P>
<P>
The light snow came as an upper-atmosphere low pressure system continued to 
buffet Southern California with unusually cold weather. 
</P>
<P>
Rick Dittmann, a meteorologist with WeatherData, Inc., which provides weather 
information for The Times, said this morning that the upper-atmosphere system 
has been circulating frigid air from Canada and the Arctic southward into 
Southern California for the past two days. He said the cold weather is 
predicted to continue for the next two days and will likely get even colder as 
clouds dissipate. But he said he sees little chance for more precipitation, 
including snow, except in the mountain areas of the state. 
</P>
<P>
"This is a pretty cold situation we're having, so I'm not surprised that snow 
turned up in some weird spot like Huntington Beach," Dittmann said. "There's 
also been some snow today in Ontario." 
</P>
<P>
Dittmann noted that clouds have been hovering over Orange County and that those 
clouds have helped keep ground heat from dissipating. But Dittmann said the 
forecast calls for the clouds to move out. This will mean colder temperatures 
this weekend, perhaps in the teens or low 20s in some areas.
