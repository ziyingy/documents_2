News From Back Home 
</P>
<P>
For all that, the weeklies report news that tells you that the heart of America 
is still ticking. It is important news, because, after all, doesn't everyone 
come from a small town -- or think one did, or wish one had? 
</P>
<P>
Here is some of the news from back home: 
</P>
<P>
Wallace Wyatt Jr. promised that if he were elected probate judge of St. Clair 
County, Ala., he would eat a super-hot barbecue sandwich at Smitty's Barb-B-Que

and it wasn't something he'd wish on anyone, even a Republican," the St. Clair 
News-Aegis reported.

tenacity was "pretty impressive."

<P>
The Enterprise also reported that people from the Oconomowoc area drove in four 
trucks for 4 1/2 hours to deliver food, clothes and paper products to northern 
Wisconsin farmers still suffering from the effects of last summer's drought.

but they especially need food. "I think they are so hungry they don't care 
about clothes."
