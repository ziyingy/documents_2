Claire Spothelfer admits that she is a Santa Claus addict. 
</P>
<P>
"I have absolutely no willpower when it comes to Santa," said the La Habra 
Heights woman. "I can't walk into a store without looking for a Santa. If I see 
one, I have to take it with me. I'm a Santa nut." 
</P>
<P>
Well, she's right. 
</P>
<P>
Since her early days when she was given her first Father Christmas by a 
favorite aunt, Spothelfer, 56, has accumulated 500 Santas in various forms, 
including the Santa pendant she wears around her neck the year around. 
</P>
<P>
Her Christmas tree is decorated with nothing but Santas. 
</P>
<P>
In fact, her entire house is decorated with her Santa collection during the 
holidays. 
</P>
<P>
"It just sort of grew like Topsy," she said. "People started giving me Santa 
for gifts and one thing led to another." 
</P>
<P>
The collection includes mugs ("I can drink from a different one every day of 
December"), plates, musical Santa dolls, wood, fabric and ceramic Santas and a 
Santa night shirt and slippers. 
</P>
<P>
In addition she has dancing Santas, Santa sheet music, nutcrackers and incense 
burners. 
</P>
<P>
Besides her cloisonne Santa pendant made in China, her other favorite is a dime 
store St. Nick with a music box that she gave to her then-5-month-old daughter 
celebrating her first Christmas. The daughter is now 27. 
</P>
<P>
Last year she didn't put her collection away until March. "My daughter told me 
I had to," she admits. 
</P>
<P>
And this year for the first time, she put her Santa collection on exhibit. It 
was shown most of December at the Whittier Historical Museum. 
</P>
<P>
"I never thought anyone but my family and friends would be interested in seeing 
the collection," said the mother of two children. 
</P>
<P>
Her infatuation with Santa Claus dates back to her youth. 
</P>
<P>
"I suppose as a child I looked forward to Santa Claus each year," said the 
former president of the Downey chapter of Los Angeles Childrens Hospital. "We 
had five children in our family and it was a big day for us." 
</P>
<P>
Spothelfer noted: "We had wonderful parents who didn't have much. They did 
without for themselves so the children could have a nice Christmas." 
</P>
<P>
Explaining her drive to collect Santas is sometimes difficult for Spothelfer, 
who calls herself a professional volunteer for everything from the PTA to the 
major and minor charitable groups. 
</P>
<P>
"Santa just warms my heart, and I've always believed in Santa Claus." she said. 
"I'm just like a kid again when I see one or look at the ones I have in my 
collection." 
</P>
<P>
Although she doesn't know the value of all her Santa items, Spothelfer has 
spent lots of money developing the collection. 
</P>
<P>
She said husband Paul Spothelfer has been supportive of her habit. 
</P>
<P>
"I have my eye on a collectible Santa that costs $1,000, and I have to have a 
talk with him," she said. 
</P>
<P>
Viewers of California's Christmas Tree on the White House lawn can thank Debbie 
Morines, 30, of Garden Grove for the clever decorations which depict elementary 
school education. 
</P>
<P>
"It was great fun," said the mother of two who sells decorations she makes at 
her Happy Patch home business to 40 stores. 
</P>
<P>
She was hired by Nordstrom, which has provided the decorations for California's 
tree since 1981, to make the decorations which were shipped to Washington and 
hung by volunteers. 
</P>
<P>
The decorations, all sealed in see-through plastic spheres, consisted of school 
desks, chalk boards, school houses, school buses, tape measures and other 
school items. 
</P>
<P>
"I didn't get to go there and see it," moaned Morines, "and as it came closer 
to the tree lighting, I said to myself, 'Boy, would I have liked to be there.' 
"
