If in your Walter Mitty dreams you see yourself as a celebrated chef, join the 
next "participation cooking class" at Mr. Stox in Anaheim on June 15. You even 
get to wear a toque. The evening will celebrate seafood and wines of the Loire 
Valley. Once outfitted with aprons and side cloths, participants will be 
divided into small groups and assigned a course to prepare, cook and serve. No 
experience is needed.

Eugenio Martignago from Bistango will be chef for the new Rex of Newport, due 
to open in Newport Beach's Fashion Island in October. Incidentally, the new 
restaurant will become Rex Chandler's special-occasion showpiece. The 
oceanfront Rex, to be re-named 21 Oceanfront, will offer more popular prices, 
but Chandler promises everything else will remain the same.

YOU CAN GET THERE FROM HERE: The Mezzanine opened last month in the Brinderson 
Towers at MacArthur Boulevard and Jamboree Road in Newport Beach, but the trick 
is to figure out how to get to it. The secret: the entrance is on Fairchild 
Road, which arcs between Jamboree and MacArthur, just north of their 
intersection. The Swiss owner, Christopher Boo (pronounced "beau"), a chef by 
training and graduate of a Swiss hotel school, served as restaurant manager for 
the Newport Four Seasons before opening the Mezzanine. He brought his brother, 
Juerg, from Switzerland to be chef. The restaurant serves breakfast in the bar 
area from 7 to 10 a.m.; lunch is from 11:30 to 2:30, but an all-day menu is 
available from 10 a.m. to 7 p.m. in the restaurant or to go. Boo plans to begin 
dinner service at the Mezzanine by the end of the year. Information: (714) 
724-1066.
