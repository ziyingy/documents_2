<P>
Californians are prepared to accept and pay for a restructuring of the state's 
health-care system but fault government leaders for failing to initiate change, 
said sponsors of the fourth annual Gallup California Health Care Poll released 
Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
While Californians remain firm in their opposition to health-care rationing and 
compromising the quality of care, 73% said they would agree to higher taxes -- 
an average of $43 per person, per month -- to pay for health care for the poor 
and uninsured, the survey found. 
</P>
<P>
Respondents also expressed support for additional taxes on alcohol and taxing 
firearms to pay for indigent health care. But government leaders received low 
marks for their handling of problems in health-care access and financing. 
</P>
<P>
"The public is ready to make the hard choices in health care that their elected 
leaders are not," said pollster George Gallup. "The public favors concrete ways 
to meet the health needs of the poor and to improve the health-care delivery 
system, and apparently is willing to foot the bill." 
</P>
<P>
The telephone poll, an annual event co-sponsored by the California Assn. of 
Hospitals and Health Systems and the three Hospital Councils of California, 
questioned 1,004 Californians regarding health-care issues and personal-health 
habits. The Hospital Council of Southern California represents 84% of hospitals 
in the region. 
</P>
<P>
The responses reflected those expressed in a Los Angeles Times Poll conducted 
in January, which revealed Americans' willingness to pay higher taxes to expand 
health-care coverage and their belief that government should take the lead in 
improving the system. 
</P>
<P>
In the Gallup Poll, two-thirds said that poor people with no Medi-Cal coverage 
deserve more service. More than half said that government is paying too little 
to hospitals for poor people on Medi-Cal. 
</P>
<P>
"A significant proportion of Californians believe that health care is a right," 
said Robert Nielsen, senior vice president of the Gallup Organization. "They 
were very clear that some form of government ought to take care of it. Eighty 
percent of Californians said that government had a responsibility." 
</P>
<P>
Half said they disapproved of the Legislature's performance on health-care 
issues, and 36% said they disapproved of Gov. George Deukmejian's performance, 
while 29% said they approved. 
</P>
<P>
"The major crisis in health care is a crisis in leadership," Nielsen said. 
"It's very clear what the general public wants, but it's not very clear who is 
going to assume the major burden and carry the political ball and make it 
happen." 
</P>
<P>
As in past years, a majority -- 61% -- opposed health-care rationing while 25% 
favored it. Under a rationing plan, services would be prioritized and those 
perceived of lowest priority would not be paid for. More than three-quarters 
said they would not be willing to accept a lower quality of health care even if 
it cost less. 
</P>
<P>
But, along with support for an increase in personal taxes, the poll revealed 
high interest in selective tax measures to pay for health care -- especially on 
products that are viewed as detrimental to health. The proposed 1990 California 
ballot initiative designed to cover some indigent health care costs by taxing 
alcohol drew a 79% approval response while 18% opposed it. 
</P>
<P>
Increased traffic violation fines were also supported, although by a lower 
margin (57% to 39%). A majority favored a new proposal to tax firearms to pay 
for indigent health care (70% to 27%) but opposed sales tax increases (40% to 
57%). 
</P>
<P>
More than eight of 10 people favored the controversial proposal drafted by 
state health officials for employer-mandated health insurance, with 50% saying 
they "strongly agreed" that employers should be required to provide basic 
health insurance to their employees and another 34% saying they "agreed." 
</P>
<P>
"Business must be alerted to the finding that 84% of the public are saying that 
the employers should be the ones responsible for funding health care through 
employee benefits," said Stephen Gamble, president of the Hospital Council of 
Southern California. "Our health-insurance system in America is based upon 
employer-employee contributions to the pool to finance health care." 
</P>
<P>
Gamble said legislators traditionally have not viewed health care as an 
"election issue." But he predicted that public opinion will influence 
legislators to propose a major restructuring of the state's health-care system 
through a 1992 ballot initiative. 
</P>
<P>
"By then we should have legislation passed to put on the ballot for a 
better-organized system for the financing and delivery of health care in 
California," he said. 
</P>
<P>
The survey also found: 
</P>
<P>
Health maintenance organizations and preferred provider organizations gained 
popularity, with 29% of respondents enrolled in such programs compared to 19% 
in 1989. 
</P>
<P>
Pollution was cited most frequently (by 22%) as the state's greatest health 
threat, a result that mirrored last year's findings. AIDS was cited as the 
major health threat by 19%, and 11% pinpointed the cost of health care. 
</P>
<P>
The majority of women from 35 to 54 indicated that they were on a diet to lose 
weight in the last year. One-quarter of males said they dieted. 
</P>
<P>
Two-thirds said they exercised at least three times a week. 
</P>
<P>
More Californians said they had been tested for the AIDS virus -- 24% this year 
compared to 18% last year. Non-whites were much more likely to express concern 
about contracting the AIDS virus. 
</P>
<P>
Respondents appeared to favor personal control regarding right-to-die 
decisions. In response to the question, "Should terminally ill adults be 
allowed to end their own life or not?" three-quarters of Californians said yes 
and one-fifth said no. A majority, 86%, believed that a relative should be 
allowed to make a refusal-of-life-support decision. 
</P>
<P>
Acknowledgment of illegal drug use rose from 20% to 21% in 1990. Whites were 
more likely to have used illegal drugs than any other racial group (22%) 
compared to Latinos (21%), Asians (19%) and blacks (16%). Drug use rose with 
educational level.
