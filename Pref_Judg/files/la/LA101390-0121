Blaming ultraconservatives for fostering an anti-gay climate that can 
contribute to suicide, Parents and Friends of Lesbians and Gays launched a 
nationwide education program Friday to combat a newly acknowledged crisis of 
gay and lesbian youth suicide. 
</P>
<P>
Some studies estimate that gay youngsters are three times as likely as non-gays 
to attempt suicide and that they account for about 30% of the 5,000 youth 
suicides each year, according to Paulette Goodman, president of the 
Washington-based group, now holding its annual convention at the Hyatt Regency 
Alicante in Garden Grove. 
</P>
<P>
"People who express themselves like (anti-gay minister) Lou Sheldon don't 
appreciate that children are killing themselves day after day," she said. 
</P>
<P>
Both Sheldon, president of the Anaheim-based Traditional Values Coalition, and 
Rep. William Dannemeyer (R-Fullerton) prevailed upon Louis Sullivan, secretary 
of the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services, to repudiate a January, 
1990, government report that contained the gay suicide statistics. 
</P>
<P>
Goodman estimated that one family in four is touched by homosexuality. But 
often, she said, parents learn of their child's homosexual orientation only 
after a suicide attempt. Others may never reveal their sexual preference out of 
shame and fear. 
</P>
<P>
The three-phase national project "Respect All Youth" will develop informational 
materials designed to increase awareness of issues that may lead young people 
to suicide; provide a systematic outreach to leaders of national youth 
organizations, including Boy and Girl Scouts and the 4-H, as well as religious 
groups and other professions, and provide training for the 200 chapters of 
PFLAG to help them reach youth and teachers in the local community. 
</P>
<P>
Speaking in favor of the project were the Rt. Rev. Oliver B. Garver, retired 
suffragan bishop of the Episcopal Diocese of Los Angeles; Jackie Goldberg, 
president of the Los Angeles School Board, and Virginia Uribe, direct of 
Project 10, a support program in public high schools for gay and lesbian teens 
to prevent them from dropping out and turning to high-risk behavior such as 
suicide, substance abuse and HIV infection. 
</P>
<P>
Financial assistance for Phase One was provided by the United Thank Offering 
Fund of the Episcopal Church. 
</P>
<P>
In addition, a Walnut Creek mother of four, Mary Griffith, spoke movingly of 
her son, Bobby, who committed suicide seven years ago at age 20. 
</P>
<P>
A devout member of a fundamentalist Presbyterian congregation, Griffith said 
the family sought Christian "reparative therapy" when Bobby disclosed his 
concern over homosexuality at 16. "I was under the illusion that God would heal 
Bobby," she said. Bobby, too, believed he had to accept the church's teachings, 
but after many years could not understand why God wasn't healing him. 
</P>
<P>
In 1983, Bobby jumped from an overpass into the path of a truck and was killed. 
In a diary found after his death, he had written: "I guess I'm no good to 
anyone, not even God." 
</P>
<P>
Wearing a button with Bobby's portrait and another with the message "We Love 
Our Gay and Lesbian Children," Griffith said: "I did not know then, as I do 
now, that Bobby did not have any more choice regarding his sexual orientation 
than did my other son and two daughters, all of whom are heterosexual." 
</P>
<P>
She broke down as she concluded: "I have learned in the most painful way 
possible that ignorance, hatred, bigotry and prejudice lead to violence and 
tragedy." 
</P>
<P>
Sheldon, president of the Traditional Values Coalition, denied that his 
statements have hurt gays. "The very opposite: we are helping the homosexual 
face their underlying condition and encouraging them to seek reparative 
therapy. 
</P>
<P>
"By ignoring the true cause of the low self-esteem, suicide, alcohol and drug 
abuse, and homosexual tendencies, PFLAG is doing a serious injustice and 
disservice to these troubled youths." 
</P>
<P>
Sheldon also opposed the education project on the ground that it teaches 
impressionable children that homosexuality is a viable life alternative.
