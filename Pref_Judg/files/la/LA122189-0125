At 22 degrees Fahrenheit, the delivery room at Sea World may be colder than 
most, but no less productive. 
</P>
<P>
In fact, more feathered couples than ever are becoming parents at the marine 
park's "Penguin Encounter" and their 45 hatchlings are attracting attention. 
</P>
<P>
Lately, the glassed-in, 5,000-square-foot cold climate exhibit has begun to 
resemble a hospital infant ward, as park visitors strain to get a glimpse of 
the 14 fast-growing Adelie penguins that are just beginning to venture outside 
their nests. 
</P>
<P>
But some of the most exciting additions to the park's penguin colony are not 
yet on public display. In addition to 23 other Adelie babies, two Gentoo 
penguins are being hand-raised by park keepers -- the first Gentoos to be born 
from eggs laid in captivity at Sea World. Six baby Humboldt penguins are being 
hand-raised as well. Keepers say that by observing the young, they hope to 
learn more about preserving Humboldts, the one penguin species that is 
endangered. 
</P>
<P>
"If there was an oil spill off the coast of Chile or Peru where the Humboldts 
are, that could disrupt the whole species," said Joop Kuhn, supervisor of 
aviculture at Sea World. "We'd need to know what to feed them, how often, how 
much. But we're getting a pretty good understanding -- we'd know where to 
start." 
</P>
<P>
With more than 500 penguins, the park's 6-year-old exhibit is the largest 
penguin colony outside of the Antarctic. As part of a project conducted with 
the National Science Foundation, the park keeps detailed records on each 
penguin from nine different species. 
</P>
<P>
There's a file, for example, on King Tut, the first King penguin park keepers 
hand-raised from an egg that was laid in the wild. There's another on Elvis, a 
King penguin named for the "king of rock and roll," Kuhn said. 
</P>
<P>
Files include personal details, he said: "Who they're paired up with, how many 
offspring they've had, if they've changed mates -- for the most part they're 
monogamous, but we've seen a slight divorce rate in our enclosure." 
</P>
<P>
Park experts know which birds have shown a knack for keeping their eggs warm, 
and which have wandered off to let the eggs fend for themselves. They know when 
a penguin lays two eggs, as they often do as a kind of "insurance," Kuhn said. 
</P>
<P>
"Most penguin species will lay two eggs but rarely will they be able to raise 
both young. It's survival of the fittest," he said. 
</P>
<P>
But park keepers, eager to supplement their growing colony, have begun rescuing 
the second eggs from the nests before they hatch. 
</P>
<P>
"Mother Nature is very tough on her own. We try to sort of soften that by 
artificial incubating," Kuhn said. "If we take one egg from our birds, and 
leave them with one, they will put all their effort and energy there." 
</P>
<P>
The hand-raised babies are treated to what keepers call penguin milkshakes, a 
tasty mixture of herring filets, shrimp-like crustaceans, half-and-half cream, 
water and vitamins that is heated to 90 degrees to resemble the regurgitated 
meals their parents would feed them in the wild, Kuhn said. 
</P>
<P>
Kuhn said the park had also hoped to hatch some Chinstrap penguins this year, 
which have never been hatched in captivity. Chinstrap penguins, named for the 
black stripe across their necks, laid eggs for the first time at Sea World this 
year. But the eggs proved infertile. 
</P>
<P>
"They do their best sitting on the eggs. Hopefully by the second year . . . 
they can pull it off," Kuhn said.
