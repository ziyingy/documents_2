Q: Is it necessary to get some tranquilizers for my cat if I plan to take him 
with me on a trip to Montana? He has ridden in my car before and just hides and 
starts to cry. I plan to get a large pet carrier to keep him in during the 
trip. I plan on being on the road for about 2 1/2 days with some frequent 
stops. He is about 6 years old and seems to be perfectly healthy.

A: If you have enough time before your journey, you might try taking your cat 
for a couple of short-duration car rides in the new carrier to see how well he 
travels. You should put a favorite blanket or towel in the carrier for him to 
hide under as well as a toy or two to keep him company. I recommend that you 
feed him about six to eight hours before the trip and give him a small amount 
of water at each stop. It might not be necessary to keep a litter box in the 
carrier unless you are planning long stretches of driving without a stop. 
Otherwise, give him a box to use at the stops or when you stop for the night.

If he still has a very stressful time in the new carrier, you should have him 
checked by your veterinarian before getting any sedatives. Make sure you have a 
copy of his vaccinations, especially rabies, when you travel, and if he needs 
any medication, get an adequate supply to last for the length of your stay. 
Good luck.

Q: When I first got my cat, I left food out and he started to gain weight, so I 
went to feeding him only twice a day. Can I go back to free feeding? It would 
sure be great for me.

A: I assume that feeding your cat just twice a day led to a return of his 
normal weight. If you want to go back to free feeding, you will first need to 
measure the amount of food that you leave out for him each day. 
</P>
<P>
You might try the free choice feeding for two weeks and then weigh him again. 
If his weight stays constant at the desired level, then continue to feed this 
measured amount. If his weight goes up, you must decrease his food by a small 
amount and then feed this new level daily. 
</P>
<P>
By monitoring his weight and the amount fed, you can control his diet and keep 
him being a healthy cat. I would recommend that he have a checkup by your 
veterinarian if he hasn't had one recently and get any necessary advice as to 
what to feed him to ensure good health.
