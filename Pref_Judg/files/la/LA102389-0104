today, showering debris for miles around and sending up a fireball visible 15 
miles away.

An elementary school 1 1/2 miles from the plant evacuated 800 pupils, and the 
Houston Ship Channel was closed by the U.S. Coast Guard.

blasts.

Thousands of people lined up on nearby roads to view the yellow and green

business at least 15 miles away and could see the flames and smoke from the 
plant.

Glen Dickey, who lives five miles from the plant, said he came home from lunch 
to find a six-foot piece of metal in a tree. "Pieces of stuff were falling out 
of the sky," he said.
