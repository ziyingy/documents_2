As a member of the Manhattan Transfer, Cheryl Bentyne has both success and 
security. Still, she occasionally likes to have the stage to herself.

"Musically, singing in a group is very structured," she said. "It's real exact 
singing. And we don't have a lot of freedom in terms of soloing; most of the 
time we just do one number apiece. That's why I think it's important to go it 
alone once in a while. It strengthens the group."

Tuesday night, at Le Cafe in Sherman Oaks, Bentyne will go it alone. It will be 
just her voice and the piano playing of Cory Allen, who often works with 
Bentyne. They put together the morning radio feature "Lady Sings the News" a 
couple of years ago for KTWV-FM (94.7).

Much of the show's material will come from Bentyne's forthcoming solo album -- 
her first. "We start to record next week," she said. "I'm hoping Tuesday's show 
will help me get my chops together.

"It's one thing to rehearse at home, but it's a whole other thing to get in 
front of an audience -- you either make it or break it. It's not even a matter 
of the audience's response, but how things come out of my mouth," she said.

Bentyne, who won a Grammy with Bobby McFerrin in 1986 for their vocal 
arrangement of "Another Night in Tunisia" on Manhattan Transfer's "Vocalese" 
album, is also set to begin work on a new group album. Her solo album and the 
Manhattan Transfer album are due to be released about the same time. 
</P>
<P>
She's tentatively planning a solo tour to support the album. "It's twice as 
much work -- like juggling two careers. I do want to showcase after the album 
comes out, but that will be down the road." 
</P>

As for Tuesday's show, she says, "It'll be pretty low-key. We're just going to 
get goofy and sing the songs we love . . . oh, there you see, I can't stop 
saying we."
