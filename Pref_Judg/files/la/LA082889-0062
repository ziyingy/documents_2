We know where Pete Rose is now. Nowhere. (Unless he's snuck onto the Home 
Shoppers Network with special limited-edition collector's plates commemorating 
nostalgic highlights of his career, like his .44-game hitting streak, his 4,256 
hits and some of his favorite Pik Six winners.) He's out of baseball. And out 
of luck. 
</P>
<P>
That's now. 
</P>
<P>
But where will he be in time? 
</P>
<P>
The questions most often asked about Rose are: Will he ever get back into 
baseball? And, will he make the Hall of Fame? 
</P>
<P>
Let's take the Hall of Fame question first, because it's a no-brainer. The 
"Character clause" in the voting was stuck in there for public relations value. 
If you cleared the Hall of Fame of drunks, reprobates, racists, tax dodgers and 
slobs, you could fit the remaining busts in a broom closet. For 22 seasons as a 
major league player Rose was the embodiment of all baseball holds most dear. He 
was its hearts, its grit and its hustle. We're not electing someone to the 
House of Representatives, we're confirming his ability to hit a baseball. If 
Pete Rose isn't in the Hall of Fame, they ought to burn it down. 
</P>
<P>
Now, will he return to baseball? And by "baseball" we are not talking about 
going to the proposed Ump de Trump Baseball League or to Japan. Will Pete Rose 
get back in major league baseball, A. Bartlett Giamatti's baseball league? 
</P>
<P>
Professor Giamatti, the Ivory Tower Executioner, has had his say. Yes, said 
Giamatti, I have concluded Mr. Rose bet on baseball. And yes, declared 
Giamatti, glaring out from forbidding racoon(CQ?), Rose is banned for life. Let 
him apply for readmittance until Great Birnan wood comes to high Dunsinane hill 
-- it will be unavailing, the professor scornfully implied. Giamatti was smug 
in his presentation, contemptuous not only of Rose but also of the media 
seeking to understand his ruling. There's an Italian word for this demeanor -- 
"superbo," which translates as great haughtiness. 
</P>
<P>
I'd rather not tie my wagon to Rose's character. I think he's more or less a 
slug. (Though I'm amused at the caravan of baseball writers who have been so 
quick to scrape him off their shoes after 20 years of unstinting praise.) There 
may be rougher times ahead for Rose, with the ongoing IRS investigation and the 
possibility of prison. But in this matter of Rose's lifetime ban from professor 
Giamatti's Chaucer and Chewing Tobacco Club, does the punishment fit the crime? 
</P>
<P>
Did Rose fix games? No. 
</P>
<P>
Did he kill someone? No. 
</P>
<P>
Is he part of a discernible conspiracy? No. 
</P>
<P>
Baseball's rule to banish for life people who gambled on their own team was 
established almost 70 years ago. Baseball was drastically different then in the 
pre-Ruth, pre-West, pre-TV days. Hardly a national sport, the Black Sox scandal 
forced baseball to struggle with a true crisis of confidence. The commissioner, 
appointed in a panic to placate the public, was expected to be dictatorial. 
</P>
<P>
But to those who claim Rose has undermined the game, I ask: How? Attendance is 
rock solid. This is no scandal. There's no crisis of confidence, no doubt of 
the game's veracity. 
</P>
<P>
Anyway, Rose hasn't been found to have a bet on his team. 
</P>
<P>
He hasn't even been found to have bet on baseball at all. 
</P>
<P>
The agreement signed by Rose and Giamatti is clear: " ... and the commissioner 
will not make any formal finding or determinations on any matter without 
limitation the allegation that Peter Edward Rose bet on any Major League 
Baseball game." Forget what Bart The Smart said. As in his letter to the judge 
canonizing Rose's chief accuser, pay attention to what he signed. 
</P>
<P>
When Rose applies for reinstatement, Giamatti can turn him down. And he can 
keep turning him down. But in the absence of a formal finding that Rose bet on 
the Reds, how long can this go on? Reading the agreement, it appears that Rose 
has been banished for life for illegal sports betting (as he admits doing), and 
for associating with known gamblers (as seems obvious) -- rule violations that 
in past administrations have elicited limited suspensions. How many rejections 
can Giamatti issue until it will seem that the only reason he keeps dismissing 
Rose is out of meanness? 
</P>
<P>
So, what can Rose do to hasten the swell of public opinion to his side? The way 
the agreement is written, even if Rose bet on baseball there's no reason to 
admit it. Most people. me included, believe he bet. But it's off the table. One 
savvy step Rose could take is to undergo counseling for gambling. I don't know 
if Rose is addicted to gambling. He says he's not. But Rose faces Catch-22. As 
soon as someone denies being an addict, 10,000 pop psychologists scream, "Aha! 
Denial! The sure sign of the addictive personality." (I resent the rush to 
medicalize all social problems; we're too enamored with the pitiful romance of 
addictions.) Even if he isn't, and he's just going through the motions for the 
PR benefit, but particularly if he's a pathological gambler, Rose would be wise 
to seek therapy; it's the welcome mat back for alcohol and drug users. 
</P>
<P>
Giamatti's supporters describe him as a compassionate man who has anguished 
over The Rose Affair. He has the chance to show this compassionate side. If he 
believes in rehabilitation (although Rose appears unreconstructed by denying he 
bet on baseball, he did demonstrate marginal remorse by admitting he "made some 
mistakes"), if Giamatti believes in the better side of man, he can hold out the 
olive branch to Rose. Show Rose the door is closed, but not locked. In three 
years -- providing Rose has been a model citizen -- Giamatti should let him 
back into baseball. He'd be a neat broadcaster. And the next season George 
Steinbrenner, who knows a thing or two about convictions and suspensions, will 
hire him to manage the Yankees.
