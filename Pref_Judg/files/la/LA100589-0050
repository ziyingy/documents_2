Because he spends much time in a wheelchair, George Meyer of Los Angeles needs 
trousers made by Copper Cove that are made of the same material as sweat pants 
(knit cotton or polyester) and have a fleece lining but are constructed like 
dress pants: straight legs, pockets, belt loops, button front, elastic 
waistband. Can you help Meyer sit pretty, or will he never find the silver 
lining?

For some work on his boat, Ben Harper of Encino needs a plane, made by Stanley, 
that is adjustable for either convex or concave work. But he's seen only one 
plane like it, and the owner wouldn't part with it. Can you let Harper know 
which way the wind is blowing, or will he have to plain realize that it's no 
sale this time?

Vera Van Iwaarden of Vista would like to get her hands on a toy called 
Click-Clack or Jacob's Ladder. It is six pieces of wood or plastic and cascaded 
down on ribbons. Wood you show Iwaarden how to play the game, or will she be 
hung up until something clicks in a reader's head?

Reader-to-Reader Help Line: David at (818) 354-7643 wants to replace a Spiro 
Agnew wristwatch that was stolen from him; the item is no longer being 
manufactured. Make sure that David will always remember that once upon a time 
people put politicians on their arms, not into their pockets. . . . Shirley at 
(213) 378-6578 would love to locate some heavy Flame Descoware cookware, which 
was discontinued years ago. How about getting fired up and lightening Shirley's 
load a bit? . . . Ralph at (714) 830-7619 needs the tempered-glass 11-inch 
turntable that fits into a Shogun Model DMR-603 microwave, made in Korea and 
discontinued some time ago. He has been able to locate only some 12-inch 
turntables, but these are obviously too big. Can you help turn the tables on 
Ralph's culinary catastrophe? . . . Margaret at (213) 645-2260 would like to 
find some slide trays for a discontinued projector; she's in the market for 
either Bausch &amp; Lomb slide trays 63-25-40 or 42, or else Yankee slide trays 
for Bausch &amp; Lomb No. BL-40D. Please make sure that Margaret soon sees her 
past experiences in a completely different light.

For M.J. Sturges, who wanted bowls for false teeth with names on them, we have 
only one true source. M.S. Samuel of Chatsworth says that the Walter Drake 
catalogue, 69 Drake Building, Colorado Springs, Colo. 80940, carries "Ma" and 
"Pa" denture keepers (F-2737 and F-2736) for $1.99 each.

For Mrs. Albert Passy of Los Angeles, who was in the market for lip liner 
pencils and refills in the Physicians Formula cosmetics line, we have a source 
she should make a beeline for. A reader sent us a newspaper ad by Thrifty drugs 
that showed the entire Physicians Formula line was on sale a few weeks ago. The 
sale is over, of course, but at least Passy knows now where to go for refills. 
And if for any reason Thrifty can't help, Lois Leuch of San Dimas says that 
Physicians Formula, which is in the City of Industry, at one time helped her 
with another difficult-to-find item.

Helen Philbin of Anaheim, who was in the market for a Promise by Poirette 
girdle, will no longer be faced with a tight squeeze. Some of the firm's 
products have been discontinued, and there has been a change in ownership, but 
we have three sources that still carry the girdles, although none is near 
Anaheim. Yasuko's Bra &amp; Lingerie Salon, 999 E. Colorado Blvd., Pasadena, 
(818) 793-2476, says it will be glad to help Philbin. Pauline Samuels of 
Pauline's Girdle &amp; Lingerie Shop, 8815 W. Pico Blvd., Los Angeles, (213) 
275-1557, says she still carries all of the Poirette line that is being made 
and also has several other garments Philbin might be interested in. And Nadine 
Carr of Oxnard writes that her source for Poirette is Althea's Corsets and 
Orthopedics, 2320 E. Main St., Ventura, (805) 643-3757.
