Nancy Dyck recalls the loss she felt last December when she walked into her 
home, stripped of its furnishings. Gone were the carpets, drapes and sofa. 
Gone, too, were her son's favorite toy, a stuffed lion, and all of her family's 
clothing, even her wedding dress. 
</P>
<P>
Everything that she, her husband and two children owned made of fabric was gone 
for good. It had been bundled into an airtight container by workers in 
spacesuit garb and trucked to a toxic waste dump in Arizona. 
</P>
<P>
The reason was that Dyck's home, which had undergone some remodeling, 
accidentally had been contaminated by workers with asbestos, the potentially 
cancer-causing material commonly used in houses and other buildings constructed 
before 1979. 
</P>
<P>
"We lived and ate and slept in it and it makes my skin crawl," Dyck said. 
</P>
<P>
Dyck's experience is extreme, but not unusual. While much of the concern about 
asbestos exposure has focused on schools, airports, office buildings and other 
public places, environmental experts say that many homeowners are unaware of 
the pollution danger lurking where they live. 
</P>
<P>
Awareness of the problem is growing as more homeowners remodel homes built in 
the '60s and '70s. Sometimes these do-it-your-self handymen -- or the small 
contractors they hire -- do not realized -- or deliberately ignore -- that the 
textured ceiling they scape contains asbestos, or the vinyl floor they rip up 
is composed of or bonded with asbestos material, or the old heating ducts they 
replace are wrapped in asbestos insulation. 
</P>
<P>
Such ignorance can result in disaster -- resulting in exposure to airborne 
asbestos, which can be inhaled and ultimately cause health problems, and 
requiring a costly cleanup by professional asbestos-abatement crews. 
</P>
<P>
Government agencies are slowly coming to recognize the problem of asbestos in 
the home. As of Jan. 1, California law requires sellers of property to provide 
a written disclosure of known toxic hazards, including asbestos, to home 
buyers. An asbestos inspection costs about $125 to $150. A few mortgage lenders 
also are beginning to require professional asbestos inspections in 
single-family homes. Ian Campbell, senior vice president of Great Western Bank, 
said the Los Angeles-based institution is developing a new policy that may 
include an asbestos inspection in its appraisals of residential property. 
</P>
<P>
So far, however, asbestos-abatement contractors say they get the vast majority 
of their homeowner referrals not from lenders or brokers but from 
heating-system installers and other contractors who discover asbestos in the 
course of their work. 
</P>
<P>
Even so, licensed abatement contractors contend that a great many unqualified 
contractors are still working with asbestos out of ignorance or because they 
don't want to forfeit potential income. 
</P>
<P>
Under another new state law, all home renovations where the amount of asbestos 
being removed is greater than 100 square feet must be reported to the South 
Coast Air Quality Management District, which inspects job sites. Also, a 
contractor removing asbestos from residences must be certified by the 
California Occupational Safety and Health Administration. 
</P>
<P>
An uncertified contractor who removes asbestos is subject to fines of up to 
$25,000 a day. 
</P>
<P>
"I would say 10% of contractors in California are actually complying with the 
law," said Joseph McLean Jr., vice president of P.W. Stephens, an 
asbestos-abatement contractor based in the City of Industry. 
</P>
<P>
The proper removal of asbestos "is not cheap," McLean observed. Removing 
heating ducts in a 1,500-square-foot home might run $2,000, he said, and 
removing a gravel-textured asbestos ceiling for "a smooth look" can cost an 
additional $5,000. 
</P>
<P>
But asbestos experts note that a homeowner who gets his property inspected for 
asbestos before remodeling can avoid a much greater financial burden and health 
hazard. And in many instances, the best choice is to leave the asbestos where 
it is. 
</P>
<P>
Carol Raczka is happy to have spent $177.50 recently on the services of a 
licensed asbestos-inspection firm before remodeling her two-story house in 
Cowan Heights in the hills north of Tustin. Ultimately, she decided not to 
remove the asbestos vinyl on her kitchen floor and instead to lay a new wood 
floor over it. And she learned that she has asbestos in her heating-duct 
insulation that should be removed if it deteriorates. 
</P>
<P>
Raczka said she believes the price of inspection was "very reasonable for the 
safety of my family." She said she is warning her neighbors about asbestos, 
"but some have already ripped up their vinyl flooring so they can't do anything 
about it. People aren't aware of the problem. They almost don't want to know." 
</P>
<P>
Dyck wishes she had known more when she hired a company to put a new roof on 
her home last August. The roofers, she said, dislodged sand, gravel and 
fiberglass that fell through slats into the house. 
</P>
<P>
As a result, she hired an industrial cleaning crew to clean up the mess. They 
ran a vacuum on the asbestos-laden acoustical ceiling of the family room, 
causing a cloud of dust to fill the air and filter through the entire 
three-bedroom house. 
</P>
<P>
After the cleanup, Dyck said, her baby daughter broke out in welts and her 
husband, Lionel, a computer-systems adviser for Rockwell International in Seal 
Beach, had continuous asthma attacks. They had the material tested and learned 
it was asbestos. 
</P>
<P>
Decontaminating the house took four months, during which the family lived in a 
hotel. Cleanup and restoration costs so far are about $64,000. But worse is the 
emotional toll it has taken on the family. 
</P>
<P>
"Ten to 15 years from now, the four of us may not be alive," she said. 
</P>

ASBESTOS HAZARDS IN THE HOME 
</P>
<P>
Here is a list of the most common sources of asbestos found in Southern 
California homes, ranked according to the health risk they present: 
</P>
<P>
1. Artificial ashes: 
</P>
<P>
These were commonly used in gas fireplaces prior to being banned in 1978. They 
contain 90% to 100% asbestos and readily shed fibers. 
</P>
<P>
2. Asbestos heater ducts: 
</P>
<P>
Looking like corrugated cardboard and sometimes faced with metal foil, these 
were widely used in Southern California prior to 1977 and contain from 35% to 
90% asbestos. If damaged, the ducts may shed fibers that can be blown 
throughout the living area. 
</P>
<P>
3. Pipe or boiler insulation: 
</P>
<P>
Generally used in connection with radiant heating systems, steam radiators and 
boiler systems. 
</P>
<P>
4. Contaminated basements or crawl spaces: 
</P>
<P>
Deteriorating asbestos material may "shed" asbestos fibers that can present a 
hazard to anyone who attempts to vacuum, sweep or in any way disturb dust in a 
basement or crawl space. Cleanup should be left to a professional. 
</P>
<P>
5. Asbestos inside heater registers: 
</P>
<P>
Tape containing asbestos can be found behind the grating of registers in 
forced-air and convection heating systems. 
</P>
<P>
6. Heater duct insulation: 
</P>
<P>
Prior to 1977, metal heating ducts were often covered with insulation 
containing up to 90% asbestos. One type, called air-cell insulation, can be 
identified by ridges on its surface. Another type is covered with a gray or 
grayish-white papery material and lacks ridges. 
</P>
<P>
7. Asbestos-backed linoleum and floor tiles: 
</P>
<P>
Both the flooring and the adhesives used to install it may contain asbestos, 
but these pose little risk if left undisturbed. Asbestos was banned from these 
materials in 1989. 
</P>
<P>
8. Fuse box liners: 
</P>
<P>
Old wooden fuse boxes may be lined with material containing up to 90% asbestos. 
</P>
<P>
9. Textured acoustical ceilings: 
</P>
<P>
Before 1979, approximately 80% of sprayed, decorative acoustic ceilings 
contained asbestos, usually from 1% to 5%, although some may have up to 40%. 
Such "cottage cheese" ceilings tend not to pose a hazard unless damaged or 
disturbed -- by a leaking roof, a child's bouncing ball, or by draperies 
brushing against them. Experts suggest using a damp paper towel to remove 
cobwebs, instead of sweeping. 
</P>
<P>
10. Roofing felts and tars: 
</P>
<P>
Many contain from 10% to 15% asbestos, but felt must be heavily worn or damaged 
to release fibers and tars rarely do. 
</P>
<P>
Other sources: 
</P>
<P>
These include joint compounds and patching plaster made prior to 1979 (3% to 
10% asbestos), artificial fireplace logs (20% to 45%), insulation on old 
knob-and-tube electrical wiring (50% to 60% asbestos), and asphalt-asbestos 
shingles used for roofing and walls( 20% to 40%). All of these sources tend to 
release fibers only if damaged during remodeling. 
</P>
<P>
