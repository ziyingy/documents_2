A simple computer glitch has rendered the state of California unable to track 
whether U.S.-owned companies in Mexico are returning their hazardous waste to 
the United States, as is required by Mexican law, a state health official 
testified Monday. 
</P>
<P>
Speaking before a legislative hearing in San Diego, John J. Kearns, the 
regional chief at the Long Beach office of the California Department of Health 
Services, said that the state's computerized tracking system cannot distinguish 
between toxic waste that originates in California and toxic waste that is 
imported from Mexico by a California-based company. 
</P>
<P>
A chemical waste management company based in Azusa, Calif., for example, could 
send waste from its branch in Tijuana back into the United States. But the 
computer would register that the waste was sent from Azusa, Kearns told Sen. 
Art Torres (D-Los Angeles), who chaired the hearing on toxic waste exportation. 
</P>
<P>
"That's where our system is breaking down," Kearns said, adding that he expects 
the computer programming problem to be solved by early next year. 
</P>
<P>
"So we really don't know how much waste is being imported, do we?" Torres 
asked. 
</P>
<P>
"No, we don't," Kearns replied. 
</P>
<P>
Kearns' remarks set the tone for the three-hour hearing, during which several 
local, state and federal environmental and health experts spoke of limited 
cooperation among agencies and minimal sharing of information, as well as 
outright confusion over whose jurisdiction prevails. 
</P>
<P>
The hearing focused on California's apparently increasing practice of exporting 
its toxic waste to other states and countries, including Mexico. Torres gave 
special attention, however, to how the hazardous refuse from the approximately 
450 Tijuana border plants -- known as maquiladoras -- is affecting San Diego 
County's air, land and water, especially the underground aquifers that provide 
both Mexico and California with water. 
</P>
<P>
The plants, owned by companies in United States, Japan and other countries, 
assemble everything from toys to video games to vehicle parts to foodstuffs, 
but they also create a considerable amount of toxic trash, including solvents, 
heavy metals, plastics, dyes, paints and resins. The precise volume of such 
wastes is unknown, and Torres' indicated during his inquiry Monday that he 
thinks watchdog agencies could do more to try to quantify the problem. 
</P>
<P>
"I am concerned about the lack of responsiveness at some agencies," he said. 
"Agencies aren't working together." 
</P>
<P>
Last year, the Mexican government passed a sweeping new set of environmental 
laws -- based largely on U.S. statutes -- that require, among other things, 
that waste generators report and track hazardous materials, and that they 
submit plans detailing methods of disposal. 
</P>
<P>
Mexican law also requires most maquiladora waste to be shipped back to its 
country of origin -- usually the United States. For each shipment of a waste 
product, companies must file a manifest, good for one year, to show where a 
specific toxin is sent. 
</P>
<P>
But, in the last 12 months, the federal Environmental Protection Agency has 
received only 25 manifests, according to Kathleen Shimmin, chief of the office 
of health and emergency planning with EPA's regional office in San Francisco. 
</P>
<P>
"I don't believe we are seeing the whole picture," Shimmin said, adding that 
she believes some California companies are illegally dumping in Mexico. She 
cited one incident in which a California company was exporting spent solvents 
to Mexico labeled not as hazardous waste, but as a product. "We believe that 
type of transport is happening, but we haven't been able to issue citations." 
</P>
<P>
Kearns also acknowledged that California has incomplete records of how much 
hazardous waste it ships out of state. If the shipper uses an out-of-state 
manifest form to record the transfer, he said, California has no way to enter 
that information in the data base. Records of those transactions that are 
received are filed by hand, he said, but there is no requirement for 
out-of-state facilities to file those records in California. 
</P>
<P>
By one estimate, data entry problems occur on 25% of manifests received, 
resulting in significant underreporting of how much waste is going where, 
according to Eric Newman, an attorney for Chemical Waste Management Inc., which 
has a plant in Tijuana. 
</P>
<P>
Newman testified that, among the top eight states that import California waste 
-- New Jersey, Utah, Idaho, Texas, Kansas, Arizona, Nevada and Louisiana -- 
several claim to have received more waste than California has a record of 
sending. 
</P>
<P>
In 1987, for example, California records show that it sent more than 4 million 
tons of hazardous waste to Nevada. But Nevada records show that it received 
more than 28 million tons of waste from California, according to figures Newman 
provided.
