The Long Beach Unified School District has received a $3.1-million federal 
grant to create a magnet program in aerospace technology at seven city schools. 
</P>
<P>
The programs, which will be developed over the next year to start in the fall 
of 1990, will give about 2,500 students in grades four to 12 aerospace-oriented 
instruction in the physical sciences, engineering and computers. 
</P>

"The idea is that the U.S. ability to compete depends upon highly skilled 
students," Richard Van Der Laan, a district spokesman, said. "This is preparing 
for the future. It's very much in the national interest, and it's very much in 
the interest of students." 
</P>
<P>
Math and science curricula for students in the fourth through eighth grades 
will emphasize flight and space. High school students will have more vocational 
and specialized instruction. 
</P>
<P>
"We will have youngsters who will have a reason to do well in math and 
science," Van Der Laan said. 
</P>
<P>
Grant money will be used to train about 80 teachers, to upgrade science labs 
and to buy new computers and software, Van Der Laan said. 
</P>
<P>
The new magnet will be the largest of Long Beach's 36 magnet programs that are 
designed to improve education and racial balance in the schools, Van Der Laan 
said. This will be the first math and science-oriented magnet offered at 
several schools at once. 
</P>
<P>
Many of the district's magnet programs are based at just one school. Students 
will enter the aerospace program in elementary school so that they will have a 
stronger math and science background by the time they get to more specialized 
learning in high school. 
</P>
<P>
"You're building preparation into the success of high school students," Van Der 
Laan said. "They will develop a strong foundation at an early stage." 
</P>
<P>
The new program will be modeled after the Center for Aviation Technology, which 
was started last year at Lakewood High School, he said. A laboratory at 
Lakewood will be upgraded to include new computers, robotics and desk-top 
publishing. Students will be able to do realistic, computer-simulated 
experiments. 
</P>
<P>
"In a way, it is like the Wright brothers," Van Der Laan said. "We've already 
gotten off the ground, but now we are headed for outer space." 
</P>
<P>
In addition to Lakewood, the program will include Buffum, Cleveland and Monroe 
elementary schools, Bancroft Junior High School and DeMille Middle School. A 
new elementary school, which does not yet have a name, is being built in Signal 
Hill and will be part of the program when it opens in September, 1990.

Of 180 school districts that applied for the grants, 53 received money, said 
David Eisner, a spokesman for U.S. Rep. Dana Rohrabacher (R-Lomita). The United 
States Department of Education and the Office of Civil Rights' Magnet Schools 
Assistance Program targeted $118 million for magnet schools nationwide, he 
said. 
</P>
<P>
The National Aeronautics and Space Administration, the Jet Propulsion 
Laboratory, McDonnell Douglas, the Northrop Corp. and Rockwell International 
Corp. will help guide the program and train teachers, Van Der Laan said.
