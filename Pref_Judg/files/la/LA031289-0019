So the Hollywood "brat pack" has taken it upon itself to show Americans that 
the Soviet "people aren't ogres but 'just like us' " ("The Brat Pack's Moscow 
Mission," by Ronald Brownstein, Jan. 22). This truth has provided the moral 
foundation for the policies of the Cold War. For if Russians and other subjects 
of the Soviet empire are just as human as we are, how can any decent human 
being tolerate a government that denies him the right to select his leaders, to 
express ideas freely, to hear diverse points of view, to practice religion and 
to emigrate? How many Soviet apologists in this country would stand for the 
denial of these basic human rights by their own government? It is the "peace" 
activists who, by trivializing the importance of freedom, have demonstrated an 
appalling lack of sympathy for the Soviet people. While most of the "brat 
packers" appear to have had their eyes opened by their Moscow trip, others have 
yet to shed their moral blinders and remain content to resign others to a fate 
that they would never accept for themselves.
