Unleash the creativity of 16 top Los Angeles interior designers, combine it 
with the talents of an equal number of outstanding area chefs and 
restaurateurs, mix in the equivalent amount of celebrities, and you have the 
recipe for the American Institute of Wine and Food fund-raiser, "Celebrations." 
</P>
<P>
This showing of holiday dining table-top designs and menus will be open to the 
public today and Sunday from 1 to 5 p.m. in the 5th-floor Grand Court/Galleria 
of the Pacific Design Center.

From Intimate to Elaborate 
</P>
<P>
Displays range from the intimate "A Cultural Affair," designed by Barbara Barry 
for Merry Norris, president of the Los Angeles Cultural Affairs Commission, to 
Waldo Fernandez's "Home Casino Party," created for client Merv Griffin and 
featuring a game table flown in from Resorts International in Atlantic City. 
</P>
<P>
Barry designed a low custom table and chaises for serving the dinner menu of 
champagne and truffle soup, circle of lobster in salt crust, square of veal in 
filo pastry with Port wine sauce and Mondrian of fresh fruit puree developed by 
Joachim Splichal of Patina. 
</P>
<P>
"I wanted to express her (Norris') personal identity," Barry said, so 
accessories to the oxblood-gold-and-yellow-hued setting include Norris' 
personal art books, paintings and sculptures. 
</P>
<P>
To accompany Griffin's home-casino party setting, Michael Roberts of Trumps 
designed a menu of cheese and artichoke croquette, clam chowder, roasted game 
hens with candied lemon and flourless chocolate cake. Turkish designer Kalef 
Alaton has used the theme "The Feast of Ramadan" in a design for Terry (Mrs. 
Dennis) Stanfill. Ron Gucciardo, Alaton's assistant, described the setting as 
"very opulent, with lots of Puiforcat silver and large-scale suede-upholstered 
dining chairs with gilt legs." Chefs/restaurateurs Mary Sue Milliken and Susan 
Feniger of City Restaurant and Border Grill developed the menu for this 
celebration. 
</P>
<P>
Opulent also describes the "Russian Easter" theme designer Craig Wright chose 
for actor Michael Douglas and his wife, Diandra. "Mrs. Douglas is very fond of 
Russian furniture," Wright said, "and has a collection in their New York 
apartment."

Bristol Glass Eggs 
</P>
<P>
The table centerpiece is made of French 19th-Century Bristol glass eggs, 
mounted in gold-washed bronze. The multicolored Flora Danica china is banded by 
gold and accompanied by Odiot of Paris gold-washed silver. The menu for the 
dinner was created by sister and brother Pam and Peter Morton of Morton's. It 
includes borscht, lamb with pickle sauce, spicy red cabbage, potato pancakes, 
sweet-and-sour cucumber salad and apple strudel. 
</P>
<P>
Quite a different approach was taken by designer Frank Pennino in his 
"Thanksgiving in the Mountains" theme for John and Rose Candy. The setting is 
the porch of a home in the Adirondacks, complete with pine trees. Twig 
furniture accompanies a quilt-covered table set with pewter, sponge ware and a 
woodsy centerpiece. The dinner menu, designed by Rolf Nonnast of Saddle Peak 
Lodge, includes parsnip mousse, quail with wild mushrooms and brioche stuffing, 
assorted baby squash, four-leaf salad and chestnut souffle.
