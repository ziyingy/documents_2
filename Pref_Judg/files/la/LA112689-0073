One small speech for (former secretary of state) George Shultz, one giant 
speech for mankind. Finally, someone from the Reagan-Bush years has opened his 
eyes to the drug problem ("Drug Legalization: Interest Rises in Prestigious

However, the big story is that he thought about this while in Washington. So, 
as our country goes down the drain, our elected officials are afraid to present 
their ideas for improvement due to the fact that they might not get reelected 
or appointed. Does drug czar William Bennett ever think about this? He probably 
does, but he will continue to spend billions of dollars that we don't have, 
fighting a war we can't win.

I never thought I could or would say this, but good for George Shultz; he may 
have started something good.
