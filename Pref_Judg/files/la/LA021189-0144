Interstate 5 -- closed since Tuesday by snowdrifts up to 5 feet deep -- 
reopened Friday, clearing a path to most of the 4,500 motorists and residents 
stranded in the mountains north of Los Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
Caltrans crews managed to scrape away enough snow to open four of the freeway's 
eight lanes at about 6 a.m., permitting the California Highway Patrol to escort 
vehicles through on the still icy pavement at about 20 m.p.h. 
</P>
<P>
By 1 p.m., the last flurries from the 3-day storm had moved east, the sun was 
shining, all eight lanes were open, the pavement was largely dry and traffic 
was moving pretty much as usual. 
</P>
<P>
Temperatures pushed above freezing for much of the day in the Gorman and Lebec 
areas, and in downtown Los Angeles the thermometer climbed to 64 degrees. 
</P>
<P>
In Orange County, Santa Ana reached a high of 64; San Clemente, 64; El Toro, 
61, and Newport Beach, 56. Early morning temperatures dropped to 53 in San 
Clemente, 53 in El Toro and 52 in Newport Beach. Newport Beach, San Clemente 
and Santa Ana reported traces of rain. 
</P>
<P>
The warmer, drier weather means fewer Orange County traffic accidents, said 
Jack Skaggs, California Highway Patrol acting sergeant in Westminster. 
</P>
<P>
"The cold weather wasn't so bad," he said. "But with rain we always have a rash 
of accidents. It's slippery, and a lot of people don't make the adjustments in 
their speed for it." 
</P>
<P>
Forecasters said weekend weather in the Los Angeles Basin should be sunny, with 
highs in the upper 50s to low 60s. 
</P>
<P>
With the improved weather, most of the residents and motorists along Interstate 
5, the state's principal north-south artery, were able to start moving about 
first thing in the morning Friday. But it took people in the isolated back 
country around Lebec, Gorman, Frazier Park and Holiday Valley a little longer. 
</P>
<P>
The Yates family, which had begun to get anxious Thursday as food and propane 
supplies started running low at their rural home in Holiday Valley, finally 
made it out Friday when a friend with a four-wheel-drive vehicle came to their 
rescue. 
</P>
<P>
It was not an easy trip for the husband and wife and their two young sons, 
though. They had to wind about 3 miles through drifts up to 4 feet deep to the 
nearest paved road and then another 10 miles or so on icy pavement to 
Interstate 5. 
</P>
<P>
At the Cracker Barrel General Store in Frazier Park, about 5 miles up Mt. Pinos 
Road from the interstate, a dozen locals gathered for the first time since 
Tuesday to drink coffee and compare notes. 
</P>
<P>
They talked about the worst storm in more than a decade, the hard work digging 
out and the 2 days of isolation. 
</P>
<P>
"There'll be a lot more kids 9 months from now," Harry Petretti said with a 
grin. 
</P>
<P>
Lee Gelinas said that even though all of them had been stuck in their homes, 
that did not mean that neighbors were not watching out for one another. 
</P>
<P>
"We called on the phone to make sure that everyone was OK," she said. "That's 
the nice thing about a small community." 
</P>
<P>
Back beside Interstate 5 in Gorman, trucker Mark Williams watched dejectedly 
from a roadside service station Friday afternoon as other vehicles whizzed 
past. 
</P>
<P>
He said he had stopped to drop off his load of gasoline at the station late 
Tuesday night, "and by the time I got unloaded, I couldn't get out." 
</P>
<P>
Stuck for 2 days in the snow, he finally appeared to be on his way Friday 
morning when a bulldozer cleared a path in front of his truck. But when he 
stepped on the starter, he said, "the battery was dead." 
</P>
<P>
Still, the warmer weather was a welcome change. 
</P>
<P>
Friday's high temperature reading of 64 degrees in Los Angeles was only 4 
degrees below the normal high for the date, but it was 24 degrees below the 
88-degree reading last year, a record for Feb. 10. The low temperature Friday 
was 51 degrees. 
</P>
<P>
Dave Beusterien, a meteorologist with WeatherData, Inc., a Wichita-based firm 
that provides forecasts for The Times, said that today promises to be a "great 
day" in the Los Angeles Basin -- "some clouds but a lot of sunshine, with highs 
in the upper 50s to low 60s."
