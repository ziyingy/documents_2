Despite the triumphs of freedom in Eastern Europe and Nicaragua, we cannot let 
down our defenses against the newest threat of silent infiltration and 
subversion. 
</P>
<P>
We are talking about the Medfly, of course, and its threat to our way of life, 
including our free-enterprise system. 
</P>

The MF, having taken Hawaii, is now invading Southern California, hidden in the 
civilian population, a classic guerrilla strategy. Their destination: through 
the mountainous "grapevine" into the heartland of middle America itself. 
</P>
<P>
MF terrorism is particularly fiendish -- defacing cars, poisoning animals, 
sexually molesting California citrus, producing maggots that literally feast on 
and destroy virgin flesh, especially the innocent peach. 
</P>
<P>
After nine years of this struggle, the MF troop totals have unexpectedly risen, 
largely due to their willing capacity to sacrifice their own kind. 
</P>
<P>
Because of their clandestine methods, only 237 MFs have been found in 25,000 
traps in Southern California. But our computer models project that there are as 
many as 1,000 MFs for every one taken prisoner. That means 237,000 of these 
fanatics are massed for attack. 
</P>
<P>
That is why aerial bombardment must continue even if there are inadvertent and 
regrettable consequences for the civilian population. 
</P>
<P>
Our defense cannot rely on the demoralized ranks of the Contra fruit flies. In 
order to maintain their loyalty, these troops have been rendered sterile and, 
frankly, the security of red-blooded Americans cannot be trusted to a bunch of 
sissies. 
</P>
<P>
The most serious threat, however, is from within. We are seeing pacifist 
attitudes begin to take root in mainstream California opinion. This so-called 
"movement" is manipulated by professional agitators whose real agenda is an MF 
takeover of our country. These traitors, with their liberal sympathizers in the 
media, are recruiting thousands of nervous Nellies who cannot stomach 
helicopter sorties even at safe ranges of 100 feet from their homes. 
</P>
<P>
This sinister pattern raises the fundamental question of whether democracy can 
compete with a ruthless enemy who has no respect for civil liberties or life 
itself. 
</P>
<P>
We cannot afford this threat on our soil. The time for polite measures is over. 
Only a more determined assault on the very birth rate of the MF will force the 
enemy to negotiations or Nicaragua-style elections, but that day is still far 
off. 
</P>
<P>
For now, the rising dovishness must be contained by the release of our White 
Paper and the promise that sterile MF reservists will be called from Hawaii. 
</P>
<P>
Where blood is spilled in this conflict, we must be careful that it be MF 
blood. The American people must support the war with funds and a minimum of 
inconvenience, though the loss of pets is inevitable. In the event that 
California goes soft, the U.S. government itself must be ready to prosecute 
this war to the finish. 
</P>
<P>
Take no prisoners. Kill the maggots. Nail the coonskin to the wall. Extremism 
in pursuit of liberty is no vice. Stand up, America! 
</P>
