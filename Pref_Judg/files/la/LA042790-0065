"We are part of the Earth, and it is part of us," Chief Seattle replied to a 
U.S. government request to buy Native American land in 1854. "The perfumed 
flowers are our sisters; the deer, the horse, the great eagle, these are our 
brothers. . . . Whatever happens to the beasts, soon happens to man. All things 
are connected."

Jaune Quick-to-See Smith, artist, member of the Flathead tribe in Montana and 
guest curator of the current exhibition at the Centro Cultural de la Raza, 
quotes Chief Seattle in both the title of the show and her introductory wall 
statement. His words serve as a screen of ideas, a philosophical filter through 
which to experience the work on view.

"Indian people," she writes, "have lived by this philosophy for eons of time. 
The Native artists have made and still make their work in reverence and praise 
of this philosophy."

"We Are Part of the Earth: Contemporary Native American Works on Paper," at the 
Centro (in Balboa Park's Pepper Grove) through May 20, joins 11 artists on the 
basis of their ethnic identity. Like most shows organized along racial or 
cultural lines, this one is both problematic and enlightening. Its curatorial 
premise constricts the audience's focus to questions of identity, ancestry and 
cultural history. The extent to which these issues are manifested in the work 
often becomes an unspoken gauge of its relevance.

Nevertheless, attention paid to artists belonging to traditions other than 
white and Eurocentric is always refreshing, at least in intent, and often the 
concentration of such work is intellectually and spiritually broadening. Chief 
Seattle's words alone give ample food for thought here with their poetic 
evocation of the unity of all living things.

A handful of works in the show resonate powerfully with this notion, especially 
Emmi Whitehorse's large drawings in oil. A rich and beautiful chaos reigns in 
the fluid, interconnected world that Whitehorse visualizes. Smooth, shadowy 
blues or warm reds dominate each page, creating a translucent veil of color 
from which figures and forms emerge and recede, taunting both gravity and 
expectation. In one work, a straight band, split at top and bottom, doubles as 
a tree and exhilarated human -- in either case, an emblem of growth and 
vitality. Leaves, fish, a crescent moon, a house and numerous linear patterns 
all float in the layered flux of Whitehorse's world. Whitehorse seizes this 
flux and presents it as if a gift, a reminder that the chaos need not be tamed, 
but can be embraced and celebrated for its endless possibilities.

In one of Gail Werner's large acrylic and charcoal works, the affinity between 
human and animal realms peaks in the symbiosis of a human head and three birds. 
The trio of birds fills in where the head form ends above the nose, and the two 
halves of the face -- and by extension, the personality -- become one, the 
contained, crisply defined facial features and the free, restless feathered 
creatures.

At the end of his speech, Chief Seattle asks: "Where is the thicket? Gone. 
Where is the eagle? Gone. The end of living and the beginning of survival." 
Victor Curran's landscape triptychs echo this sense of oppressed, stifled 
nature. One of the drawings reads as a lively mosaic of snugly interlocked 
shapes until the title, "Designated Landscape," transforms it into a view of 
the earth as unfree, compartmentalized, assigned. "Riparian Thicket," too, 
suggests a landscape lost, obstructed, inaccessible. 
</P>

Few other artists in the show pay homage to the theme of Chief Seattle's speech 
in as overt and meaningful a way as these three. Joe Feddersen's 
computer-generated prints impose patterns over a human silhouette in a 
gratuitous display of technical prowess. Michael McCabe and Susan Stewart seem 
to derive their abstract, patterned imagery as much from a generic vocabulary 
of decorator wallpaper as from the spirals and snaking lines of Native American 
art.

Corwin Clairmont's "Trade Goods Series" of laminated photographs and text 
introduces provocative ideas about cultural exchange and the reduction of a 
living culture to a material souvenir, but the work remains stunted at a 
conceptual level, never quite ascending to a level of visual interest. The 
toned and tinted photographs of Carm Little Turtle inject some narrative 
appeal, especially the four-part sequence, "She Wished for a Husband, Two 
Horses and Many Cows." 
</P>
<P>
Linda Lomahaftewa, Armond Lara and Jeanne La Marr are also represented in this 
scattered survey of Native American works on paper, a mixed blessing of a show 
tethered to the profound simplicity of Chief Seattle's words: "What is there to 
life if a man cannot hear the lonely cry of the whippoorwill or the arguments 
of the frogs around a pond at night?"

 Jaune Quick-to-See Smith will give a free lecture about the exhibition and 
Native American art tonight at 7:30 at the Centro Cultural de la Raza.
