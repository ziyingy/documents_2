There was a drummer whose academic strength lay in fine arts and language, a 
saxophone player who knew more about space exploration than most adults, and a 
drama student for whom speech and interviewing skills were second nature. 
</P>
<P>
In all, there were 10 El Rancho High School students with enough smarts to 
carry on the school's tradition of excellence in the Southeast Region of the 
1990 Los Angeles County Academic Decathlon. 
</P>
<P>
For the second time in the last three years, El Rancho High School students 
have won the Southeast Region of the county decathlon, the nation's largest 
academic contest. The group of 10 students last month beat out competitors from 
20 other high schools in the challenging contest that included such questions 
as: "What country made the mechanical arm for the space shuttle?" "What was 
George Bush doing when Nixon resigned?" and "Who was the fifth Beatle?" 
</P>
<P>
El Rancho High School won the Southeast Region in 1988, and last year placed 
second to Cerritos High School. In overall county standings this year, the El 
Rancho team placed 14th out of 83 schools. 
</P>
<P>
"We're excited," El Rancho Principal David Verdugo said. "We compete against 
some schools with outstanding reputations. . . . The results speak for the 
entire school." 
</P>
<P>
The team members are juniors Joanne Szeto, Matthew Walker, Sheila Panganiban, 
Demosthenes Spiropoulos, Mai T. Le and Federico Moran, and seniors Ernesto 
Carreon, Marisol Pugliese, Jay Boyette and Michael Weinholt. 
</P>
<P>
The team members attributed their victory to hard work, team spirit and plain 
common sense. 
</P>
<P>
"A lot of it is logic," said Weinholt, who was the region's top scorer in the 
scholastic category. 
</P>
<P>
According to rules of the decathlon, teams must consist of three students each 
with A, B and C grade averages. The A students are known as honor students, B 
as scholastic and C as varsity. The 10th team member is an alternate.

The academic decathlon was started in Orange County in 1968. It went statewide 
in 1979, and in 1982 became a national competition. This year's winner of the 
Los Angeles County competition, West High School of Torrance, will compete at 
the state decathlon in Riverside next March. 
</P>
<P>
Decathlon competitors are given written and verbal examinations on subjects 
including economics, language, literature, fine arts, mathematics, science and 
history. Students also must give prepared and extemporaneous speeches. In the 
last and by far the most intense phase of the contest, individual students are 
bombarded with questions in front of a gymnasium full of students, parents and 
teachers. This year's theme was space exploration and the decades of the 1960s 
and 1970s. 
</P>

Preparation at El Rancho began last May, when the team members were drafted. 
Some students were selected by their teachers, others volunteered. The crucial 
test to determine whether a student had the mettle to compete in the decathlon 
came when school let out for the summer. It was then, coach Doug Anderson said, 
that team members had to meet at the school at 6:30 every morning for more than 
two months to study for the decathlon. 
</P>
<P>
For many students, the idea of giving up the leisurely morning sleep of summer 
to study for an extracurricular test is repugnant, but decathlon team members 
said it was worth it. 
</P>
<P>
"I think it helps us become more well-rounded," Le said. 
</P>
<P>
The students also said that in studying for the decathlon, they learned to 
think under pressure and that the intense preparation sessions helped them more 
than regular classes to learn. 
</P>
<P>
There are more practical reasons for their commitment, as well. 
</P>
<P>
"It looks good on (high school) transcripts," Spiropoulos said. 
</P>
<P>
This year, the team's goal was to beat Cerritos High School. Next year, they 
said, they hope to become one of the top 10 scorers in the county.
