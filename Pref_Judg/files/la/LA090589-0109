With schools opening in Los Angeles and throughout California next week, it's 
time for the fall migration -- the migration of the common cold from home to 
classroom and back. 
</P>
<P>
It's also the time when working parents begin worrying about finding care for 
their kids who are too sick to go to school. 
</P>
<P>
This dilemma of the virus season results in employee absenteeism and turmoil in 
the family, yet the idea of day-care centers for children who have minor 
childhood illnesses is moving slowly in the United States. 
</P>
<P>
Even where sick-child centers do exist, they aren't always successful. Two in 
downtown Los Angeles closed last year for lack of usage, apparently because 
parents preferred to stay home with their sick children, the operators say. 
</P>
<P>
Only about 70 centers have emerged nationwide over the last eight years, with 
about 700 slots to fill a need that is estimated at 350,000 children daily, 
according to the National Assn. for Sick Child Day Care. 
</P>
<P>
There are at least 19 million children in the United States younger than 14 
whose parents work full time outside the home and who have no one at home 
during the day, according to a 1986 report by the U.S. Bureau of Labor 
Statistics. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Families Coping 
</P>
<P>
"Right now, most families are coping by having the parent stay at home with the 
sick child," said Carla Rayacich, president of a company that is opening a new 
center for sick children in the Silicon Valley community of Sunnyvale this 
week. Rayacich said research by the sick child day-care association estimates 
the annual cost to U.S. business of these absences at $7 billion to $10 
billion, even larger than the cost to employers of illnesses of the workers 
themselves. 
</P>
<P>
Parents who have to be at work may take their sick children to school or 
regular day care anyway. 
</P>
<P>
"People load the kid up with Tylenol and drop them off, and then they know 
they'll get at least three hours at work before the day-care center calls," 
Rayacich said. 
</P>
<P>
Jamar Schoessow, a school nurse at John Muir and Will Rogers elementary schools 
in Santa Monica, said she sends home about six children a day during the peak 
of the viral season. 
</P>
<P>
Because a child with a common cold is most contagious just before getting 
symptoms, there is no requirement to keep him home if he doesn't have a fever, 
according to California health guidelines for schools. But the misery index 
often brings these children to the nurse's office to lie down and get a little 
TLC, Schoessow said. 
</P>
<P>
The problem has increased particularly in the last two years, she said, since 
her district began accepting students who live outside its boundaries but whose 
parents work in Santa Monica. 
</P>
<P>
"They bring their kids sick because the parents work in Santa Monica and come 
from so far, and have no one close by," Schoessow said. "I sometimes keep these 
kids in school the whole day sick -- really sick. Then they come back (to 
school) too soon because the parents have to go to work. 
</P>
<P>
"I understand that, because these people who have these jobs are people who 
have worked hard to get where they are. And they need to have a steady job." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Juggling Responsibilities 
</P>
<P>
This juggling of work and child-rearing places enormous strain on parents and 
children, Rayacich said, using the poignant story of a 5-year-old to 
illustrate. 
</P>
<P>
While visiting a center for sick children, Rayacich said, she asked the boy how 
he liked the center and how it compared to having his mother take time off work 
to care for him at home. 
</P>
<P>
"I like it (the center) fine," the boy told her. "It's more fun. I'm not as 
lonely and Mommy doesn't cry." 
</P>
<P>
Sheri Senter, president of National Pediatric Support Services, an Irvine 
company that operates Rainbow Retreat sick-child units in Pasadena, Huntington 
Beach and Newport Beach, said she believes parents are just beginning to 
consider such facilities as an option. 
</P>
<P>
"It's a learning curve," Senter said. "In every needs assessment that we do for 
corporations, sick-child care is coming back number one. People can't miss any 
more days of work. And we're seeing children enter group care at a younger age, 
so they're getting sick more frequently." 
</P>
<P>
Still, the 15-bed center sponsored by Transamerica Life Cos. at the California 
Medical Center in downtown Los Angeles closed in June, 1988, after two years 
because it was never more than one-third occupied, said Sandy Comrie, vice 
president for human resources for the company. 
</P>
<P>
A two-bed unit at the California Pediatric and Family Medical Center, a 
downtown clinic, saw almost no usage so it closed in April, 1988, after eight 
months of operation. 
</P>
<P>
Such problems generally result from not getting the word out to parents, from 
not answering their questions about the concept and from setting up barriers to 
usage, Senter and Rayacich said. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Common Questions 
</P>
<P>
The most common parental questions, according to Rayacich: 
</P>
<P>
* How do the centers prevent the spread of disease from child to child? (Toys 
are kept separate, and each child has his own bed with clean linens. Children 
with diseases such as chicken pox are isolated, though some centers won't take 
chicken pox cases.) 
</P>
<P>
* What are the procedures for bringing the child in? (Usually, a phone call at 
least an hour ahead of time to reserve space is required.) 
</P>
<P>
* Should registration forms be filled out ahead of time? (It saves time to do 
this, and also gives a chance for parent and child to tour the center.) 
</P>
<P>
* Does the child need to go to the doctor first? (Some hospital-based centers 
have pediatricians who examine all the children, either for the same fee as an 
office visit or sometimes free. They also will do throat cultures or other 
routine tests. Requiring parents to take the child to the doctor first takes so 
much time that parents tend not to use the sick-child center, Rayacich said.) 
</P>
<P>
* How much does it cost? (Senter's facilities charge $5 a hour to the public, 
$3.50 an hour for corporate-sponsored clients or regular day-care students. 
Torrance Memorial Hospital and Northridge Hospital Medical Center charge $3 and 
$3.25 an hour, respectively. Rayacich's new center in Sunnyvale, called Feeling 
Better Health Day Care, will charge $39 a day.) 
</P>
<P>
Most of the centers are attached to hospital pediatric units and help the 
hospitals build good will as well as fill space. Senter said she believes 
hospitals aren't the best environment for children who are only moderately ill, 
but hospitals can keep down the cost of care by piggybacking the sick-child 
units on existing facilities. Day-care centers can't do that, so they find 
sick-child units too costly, she said. 
</P>
<P>
Rayacich's Feeling Better center is expanding the sick-child center concept 
outside of hospital and day-care center, into a free-standing facility just for 
ill children. With 42 beds, it is four times the size of the average unit 
elsewhere. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Model for Other Centers 
</P>
<P>
Funded by a group of socially conscious investors, she said, Feeling Better is 
intended as a model for establishment of similar centers around the country. 
</P>
<P>
Given the right promotion, a hospital's sick-child unit becomes an essential 
part of the community, said Betty Nosbisch, director of pediatrics at Covenant 
Medical Center in Waterloo, Iowa. 
</P>
<P>
The five-bed Sick Bay child center at Covenant will be five years old this 
fall, Nosbisch said, and "a lot of families have come to depend on us." 
</P>
<P>
One of these parents is Susie Schwieger, assistant director of placement at the 
University of Northern Iowa. Her daughter Anne, 6, and son Matthew, 4, have 
been going to Sick Bay for two years. 
</P>
<P>
Her own traditional upbringing made taking the children there for the first 
time difficult, Schwieger said. "I asked myself, 'Am I abandoning my children 
when they're ill?' " she said. "I grew up in a really traditional home where my 
mom didn't work outside the home. So when we were sick she was there constantly 
at our bedside." 
</P>
<P>
But when the children obviously enjoyed the experience, Schwieger's fears -- 
and guilt -- vanished.
