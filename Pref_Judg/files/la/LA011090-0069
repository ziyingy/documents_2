<P>
This is the full text of Gov. George Deukmejian's State of the State address. 
</P>
<P>
Lt. Gov. McCarthy, Mr. Speaker, Mr. President Pro Tem, members of the 
Legislature, fellow constitutional officers and fellow Californians: 
</P>
<P>
As I begin the first year of the 1990s, on behalf of Gloria and myself we want 
to wish all of you a decade that is filled with hope, with peace, continued 
prosperity and with much happiness. 
</P>
<P>
When I delivered my first State of the State address in 1983, we all came 
together at a time when the state was experiencing an economic quake. For the 
past seven years, we have worked together to restore fiscal solvency, our 
credit rating, the economy, and to create jobs, jobs and more jobs. 
</P>
<P>
As a result, the California that was once headed for the poorhouse is now an 
economic powerhouse. 
</P>
<P>
Back then, unemployment was 11%. We had no overseas trade offices, no tourism 
promotion program and no competitive technology, workfare or Rural Renaissance 
programs. The agricultural industry was on the ropes. Our workers' compensation 
program was a mess, and prior to our Administration we had one of the highest 
tax burdens in the nation. 
</P>
<P>
Since then, unemployment has been cut to 5.3%, and 2.7 million new jobs have 
been created for our people. And while the budget I inherited contained a 
$1.5-billion deficit, the budget I leave my successor will contain a 
substantial surplus. 
</P>
<P>
We have become a state of builders. All told, we have invested or have 
immediate plans to invest $44.6 billion to expand and improve California's 
infrastructure. 
</P>
<P>
We have constructed or rehabilitated 1,133 lane miles of state roads and 
highways, including the addition of 478 miles of new roads to our system. 
</P>
<P>
In 1983, California had just 12 state prisons to house dangerous criminals. 
Since then, we have built 14 new prison facilities. That has enabled us to 
remove an additional 52,000 convicted felons from neighborhoods to send them to 
state prison. And I will continue to push for a constitutional amendment that 
allows all able-bodied criminals to work and help pay the cost of their upkeep, 
just like the rest of us must do. 
</P>
<P>
We had no integrated strategy to clean up toxic waste or reduce non-hazardous 
waste. In 1983, none of our state hospitals for the mentally ill were 
accredited. Today, all of them are accredited. We are providing $127 million 
this year to aid the homeless in our state. Our commitment to fighting AIDS and 
finding a cure for that dreaded disease is unmatched by any other state. And 
this year, we will provide 20 million meals for seniors, as well as income 
security for more than 800,000 elderly, blind and disabled Californians. 
</P>
<P>
Building on the progress of the '80s, it's time to turn to the challenges of 
the '90s. 
</P>
<P>
We'll get nowhere fast if we don't do something about freeway gridlock. 
</P>
<P>
Last year, we developed a major transportation improvement plan for the 1990s. 
This June, the voters will be asked to approve the Traffic Congestion Relief 
and Spending Limitation Act of 1990, a comprehensive plan to relieve traffic 
congestion on our highways, upgrade our urban and rural road systems, and 
expand mass transit. 
</P>
<P>
This plan is absolutely essential to the economic future of our state. If you 
want to spend less time stuck in traffic, if you want cleaner air and if you 
want to ensure that California's economy will continue to grow so that your 
children will have job opportunities, then I suggest it is worth paying a few 
more pennies a day. I'm strongly urging all Californians to join me and a 
bipartisan majority in the Legislature in giving this landmark proposal their 
enthusiastic support. 
</P>
<P>
Just as the next exit on the freeway is becoming harder to reach, so is the 
dream of home ownership. I am proposing that the Legislature join me in 
enacting a five-year, $2-billion Housing Opportunity Program to greatly expand 
our efforts to put home ownership back within reach of the average family. 
</P>
<P>
Using its existing bonding authority, the California Housing Finance Agency 
will raise $1.8 billion of these funds through the issuance of both revenue and 
private activity bonds. Another $200 million can be generated through a 
reauthorization of unutilized general obligation bonds already approved by the 
voters when they passed the First-Time Homebuyers Bond Act of 1982. 
</P>
<P>
Together, these funds will be dedicated to providing down payment assistance 
and reduced interest rate mortgages for thousands of first-time home buyers. 
</P>
<P>
With home ownership in California becoming even more difficult, let us take 
these important steps now to prevent the American dream from becoming the 
impossible dream. 
</P>
<P>
The dawn of a new decade should bring with it completion of our work on another 
milestone of humanity -- basic health care coverage for all working 
Californians and their families. 
</P>
<P>
An estimated 4 million working Californians and dependents have no coverage, 
and securing private health insurance is too expensive for most of these 
families. 
</P>
<P>
Pursuant to legislation I signed last year, a task force established by our 
Administration will make recommendations shortly so that we can develop a plan 
that is both fair to small businesses and which addresses the health care needs 
of the uninsured. 
</P>
<P>
And while we're talking about insurance, let me also address the subject of car 
insurance. When I vetoed Assembly Bill 2315 last year, I told the bill's 
author, Speaker Willie Brown, that I would work with him to develop a practical 
and affordable basic policy for motorists who are now unable to secure or 
afford even minimal coverage. Our staffs have begun discussions which I hope 
will lead to some positive steps this year to increase the affordability of 
automobile insurance in California. 
</P>
<P>
California's response to the terrifying earthquake of Oct. 17, 1989, was 
outstanding. That earthquake may have registered high on the Richter scale, but 
our people registered even higher on the courage scale. 
</P>
<P>
Yet, we should learn from this experience and take additional steps now to 
prepare for future disasters. 
</P>
<P>
I am proposing $11 million in additional expenditures to fund new disaster 
readiness measures including: planning a site for a Southern California 
Operations Center of the Office of Emergency Services; statewide inspection of 
public schools and state buildings; and the purchase of additional rescue and 
communications equipment. 
</P>
<P>
I am also proposing an additional $350 million in bonds to retrofit state 
buildingsand higher education facilities. 
</P>
<P>
In addition, I am proposing that $15 million from the proceeds of the sale of 
some surplus property at Agnews State Hospital in San Jose be directed toward 
providing permanent housing for low-income residents displaced from their homes 
by the earthquake. 
</P>
<P>
Also, I will propose a method to assist earthquake-affected communities which 
sustained major losses of tax revenue. 
</P>
<P>
Finally, let's understand that there are going to be additional serious 
earthquakes in California in the future, and we cannot duck that reality. No 
earthquake rebuilding effort will be complete, or responsible, until we make 
earthquake insurance coverage a mandatory feature of all policies written for 
at-risk privately owned buildings. I am asking the insurance industry, the 
business community and the Legislature to work with me to develop a practical 
plan to achieve this goal this year. 
</P>
<P>
We can't talk about the challenges of the 1990s without speaking of 
California's children. During the past seven years, we have accomplished some 
needed reforms in our public schools and more than doubled their funding. And 
we have indeed restored pride and excellence to our public institutions of 
higher education. 
</P>
<P>
My message to the young people is that the benefits of staying in school will 
pay off every day, for the rest of your life. I urge you to remain with your 
education, and then your education will remain with you. 
</P>
<P>
In 1986 I proposed, and we have implemented, a Children's Initiative designed 
to improve health care, day care and child support collections on behalf of the 
young, and to better protect them from abuse. 
</P>
<P>
And yet all our efforts will be squandered if we continue to allow the 
destruction of our young people by poisonous drugs. 
</P>
<P>
My new budget contains an additional $10 million to expand a life-saving effort 
we began last year -- drug education in our schools. With two-year expenditures 
totaling $54 million, we will now be able to include drug education in every 
school from grades four to eight. 
</P>
<P>
We must also take additional steps to stem the flow of illegal drugs coming 
across our borders. I am pleased to report that the federal government has 
approved the allocation of $10 million to the California National Guard to step 
up its work with local law enforcement agencies to stop the smuggling of drugs 
across our border. 
</P>
<P>
Recently, some have suggested that legalization is the solution to the drug 
problem. Well, they are dead wrong. We must never, never wave the white flag of 
surrender at the white plague of cocaine, and other drugs. 
</P>
<P>
Currently, our school-age population is growing at a rate 40% faster than our 
population as a whole. With that kind of growth, we can't depend simply on 
building our way out of the shortage of classrooms, even though we have 
completed nearly 700 school construction projects since 1983. My new budget 
contains an additional $1.6-billion bond proposal for school construction, but 
it will be accompanied by these additional proposals: 
</P>
<P>
First, we will provide strong financial incentives to districts which adopt a 
year-round school program, including special per-student payments and 
first-call on school construction bond funds. It is simply inexcusable and 
wasteful to allow school facilities to sit idle and unused for up to three 
months per year. 
</P>
<P>
Second, in order to encourage local districts who move toward year-round 
schools to enact their own local school bond measures, I would support a 
constitutional amendment to reduce to 60% the two-thirds vote that is now 
required for approval of those bonds. 
</P>
<P>
Californians are justly concerned about preserving the natural beauty and 
health of our environment and protecting it from air, water and toxic 
pollution. We have enacted the toughest laws in the nation, and we acquired and 
preserved thousands of acres of sensitive lands. Yet regrettably, our state is 
getting dirtier by the day -- not from those types of pollution, but from the 
garbage thrown on our streets and the graffiti plastered on our walls. It is 
time for California to clean up its act. 
</P>
<P>
I am proposing that we double the amount of litter cleanup work performed by 
Caltrans on our state's major urban freeways. We will also encourage 
neighborhoods, civic organizations and youth groups to "adopt a highway," and 
take the responsibility for keeping it clean. Also, I am instructing the 
California Highway Patrol to redouble its efforts to catch litterbugs in the 
act, pull them over and fine them. 
</P>
<P>
I want Californians to be able to take pride in their communities and their 
state once again. We must persuade, educate and insist that all residents 
respect our roads, freeways, walls, beaches, parks and neighborhoods -- and 
stop using them as their own personal garbage dump. 
</P>
<P>
Finally, let me say a few words about the new budget, which I will be 
submitting to you tomorrow. 
</P>
<P>
The budget I am proposing is a balanced budget that contains a prudent reserve 
and no general tax increases. 
</P>
<P>
It is $3.4 billion more than the current-year budget. And I might add 
parenthetically that it is 100% bigger than my first budget in 1983. 
</P>
<P>
The Department of Finance is projecting an 8.4% growth in general fund revenues 
in the coming year. Yet, under existing laws -- including entitlement programs, 
annual cost-of-living increases, caseload requirements and a constitutionally 
required prudent reserve -- the general fund budget would expand by more than 
11%. 
</P>
<P>
Ladies and gentlemen, we must face reality. When you have laws requiring 
spending increases of 11% and additional income of 8.4%, it is evident that 
adjustments in some programs will be needed to bring the projected rise in 
spending in line with the projected rise in income. 
</P>
<P>
Any government which is programmed on autopilot to build its base budget by 11% 
a year, not including any new programs, is headed for trouble. The economy 
can't grow fast enough -- nor would the public stand for an annual automatic 
tax increase -- to sustain such an exorbitant level of government growth. 
</P>
<P>
And so, I will propose a number of reasonable and necessary legislative changes 
in some programs. But let me emphasize that this is my January budget proposal, 
which is based on the best information we can get at this time. Just as I did 
last year, I am prepared to sit down with the legislative leadership for as 
long as it takes in the coming months to achieve a consensus budget. 
</P>
<P>
My fellow Californians, as we begin the 1990s, we should be thankful that our 
state is stronger and more prosperous than it has ever been. Through common 
sense and through cooperation, we have achieved fiscal responsibility. We have 
restored economic excellence -- but now we have to preserve it, we have to 
protect it, we have to build upon it, and we have to make sure that it is 
equally shared. 
</P>
<P>
The initiatives I have put forward today represent an ambitious but compelling 
agenda for a state which in the 1990s will see its 29-million population grow 
by another 5 million residents, and where ethnic minority communities combined 
will constitute the majority. And please understand, I chose policies with my 
eyes fixed not on this governor but my eyes fixed on the future of California. 
</P>
<P>
Like so many others, I became a Californian not by birth but by choice. I 
adopted a state whose opportunities are as boundless as its beauty, whose 
future is as bright as its sunshine, and whose possibilities are as varied as 
its people. I want to preserve that kind of California for all of our children 
and our grandchildren. 
</P>
<P>
As I enter my 28th and final year of public life, I am grateful for the 
opportunity the people have given me to serve them, beginning only seven years 
after my arrival in this state, with my first oath of office as an assemblyman 
in this chamber -- and ending as the leader of a state that is the leader of 
America. 
</P>
<P>
As most of you know, Gloria and I are first-generation Americans. Our parents 
struggled, they worked hard to give their children a better start in life than 
they have had. 
</P>
<P>
We have tried to do the same for our children, and as governor my goal was to 
leave California better than when I came into office. I believe that it is 
better than it was, and that is why literally millions of people have come here 
in the past few years seeking unlimited opportunities. 
</P>
<P>
Together, we have done well, but I know we can do better. Despite some of our 
differences, we are bonded by our desire to pass along to the next generation 
the golden opportunities of the Golden State. There is still much to accomplish 
in this first year of the last decade of the 20th Century, so let's carry on in 
a spirit of unity and good will. 
</P>
<P>
Thank you very much. 
</P>
