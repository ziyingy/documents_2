Dr. William K. Summers' controversial research into an experimental drug for 
Alzheimer's disease will be allowed to continue under an agreement worked out 
this month between the Arcadia psychiatrist and the U.S. Food and Drug 
Administration. 
</P>
<P>
Under the agreement, Summers must abide strictly by federal research rules that 
the FDA accused him of violating in his study, which concluded 2 1/2 years ago 
that the experimental drug THA had caused "dramatic" improvement in Alzheimer's 
patients. 
</P>
<P>
Specifically, Summers must personally conduct and supervise research activities 
that the FDA accused him of delegating to others. He also agreed, in a May 4 
letter to the FDA, to keep accurate patient records and not deviate from his 
approved research plan. 
</P>
<P>
"His problems were more in the areas of sloppiness and lack of understanding of 
exactly what is required in the conduct of a truly high-class, scientific 
study," Dr. Alan Lisook, chief of clinical investigations for the FDA, said 
Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
Summers, however, insisted in an interview that the agreement with the agency 
contains nothing he has not already done. He said any perceived shortcomings in 
his work were mere technicalities and the conclusion of his study remains 
valid. 
</P>
<P>
"If they actually had anything, they would have gone the legal route," Summers 
said of the FDA, which began investigating him in 1987. He likened the 
investigation process to having been turned upside down and shaken until small 
change fell out of his pockets. 
</P>
<P>
The FDA in the agreement did not address the question of the effectiveness of 
the drug. 
</P>
<P>
Summers attracted the attention of the FDA in November, 1986, when he published 
in the New England Journal of Medicine a report stating that the drug, also 
known as tacrine, had improved memory function in 16 out of 17 patients Summers 
had studied. 
</P>
<P>
According to Lisook, the agency then embarked upon an audit of Summers' records 
because of the potential significance of his study. Word of his findings had 
attracted worldwide interest and set in motion a large, nationwide study of the 
drug, which is now under way. 
</P>
<P>
Alzheimer's, a progressive brain disorder that impairs thinking and behavior, 
is the fifth leading cause of death in the United States. It affects 2.5 
million Americans, and there is no effective treatment or cure. 
</P>
<P>
The FDA investigation culminated in January, 1988, in a six-page letter 
accusing Summers of "repeatedly or deliberately" violating research rules by 
submitting false information, deviating from his study plan and failing to 
maintain adequate records. 
</P>
<P>
For example, the FDA accused Summers of failing to mention that 10 of 12 
subjects lived more than 2,000 miles away and were monitored largely by 
telephone. He had failed to provide evidence that he had actually conducted 
certain tests he claimed to have done, the FDA said. 
</P>
<P>
The FDA also said Summers had failed to account for about 6,250 capsules of the 
drug during a one-year period and had failed to follow federal rules requiring 
that all patients give their "informed consent" before participating in drug 
trials. 
</P>
<P>
In the new agreement, outlined in letters between the agency and Summers, 
Summers agreed to personally conduct various parts of the study -- a condition 
Lisook said was intended "to guard against excessive delegation to other 
people," including patients' relatives. 
</P>
<P>
Summers also agreed to adhere strictly to his study plan, keep accurate and 
adequate records, ensure that adequate records are kept, obtain the informed 
consent of patients and keep close track of distribution of the drug. 
</P>
<P>
Also at the request of the FDA, Summers has written to the New England Journal 
of Medicine clarifying aspects of his methodology that the agency felt he had 
misrepresented. That letter, approved by the agency, is to be published as a 
letter to the editor. 
</P>
<P>
In an interview Thursday, Summers insisted the agreement included nothing he 
was not already doing. He said that he sees all of his patients regularly and 
that any shortcomings in record-keeping were "within the range of error that is 
typical for this type of work." 
</P>
<P>
"What we did was human science," Summers said. 
</P>
<P>
Only 11 of the 45 original patients in Summers' study remain on the drug, 
Summers said. Seven were asked to drop out for failure to abide by study rules. 
Of the others, about half have died and the other half have dropped out because 
their spouse or caretaker died.
