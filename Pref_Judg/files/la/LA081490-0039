Saddam Hussein's invasion of Kuwait may have plunged the Middle East into its 
worst crisis since the Six Day War of 1967, but the standoff in the sand has 
given a boost to lawmakers and environmentalists concerned over the threat of 
global climate warming. 
</P>
<P>
For more than a year, activists had been trying, without much success, to get 
the Bush Administration to seek dramatic reductions in America's output of 
carbon dioxide, the "greenhouse gas" principally responsible for trapping the 
sun's heat. The government had rebuffed their appeals on grounds that it needed 
more information -- both on the evidence of accelerated warming and the cost of 
reducing carbon dioxide emissions. 
</P>
<P>
But with the threat of a drop in world oil supplies as a result of the loss of 
Iraqi and Kuwaiti oil, the U.S. may now come face to face with the need to 
conserve fuel. The Gulf crisis may generate support for making cars more 
efficient, a potentially huge step toward reducing carbon dioxide emissions. 
</P>
<P>
"Increased fuel efficiency," said Daniel Becker of the Sierra Club, "is the 
single most important contribution we can now make toward combatting global 
warming."

Pending Legislation 
</P>
<P>
A bill pending in the Senate would require automobile manufacturers to produce, 
by the turn of the century, vehicles that average up to 45 miles per gallon of 
gasoline, compared to an average of 18 m.p.g. for all cars now on the road and 
27.5 m.p.g. for new cars sold this year. 
</P>
<P>
Each year, the United States pumps 1.25 billion tons of carbon dioxide into the 
atmosphere. Nearly a third of this comes from motor vehicles. Another third 
comes from the burning of coal, oil and gas to produce electricity. The rest is 
from miscellaneous other industrial sources. 
</P>
<P>
Sen. Richard H. Bryan (D-Nev.), chief sponsor of the fuel efficiency measure 
expected to be put before the Senate in the fall, says it would result in 
carbon dioxide emissions being reduced by 485 million tons in the first six 
years. Over the lifetime of automobiles manufactured in 1995, it would save 9.1 
billion gallons of gasoline. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
The Background 
</P>
<P>
When the Senate Commerce, Science, and Transportation Committee approved its 
sweeping modernization of clean air laws earlier this year, it included a 
requirement for a 40-m.p.g. average for cars by the year 2000. 
</P>
<P>
But the measure was adamantly opposed by the Bush Administration. In closed 
negotiations arranged to save the package from a veto, Senate leaders agreed to 
drop the auto efficiency rule. Senate Majority Leader George J. Mitchell 
(D-Me.) promised Bryan that it would be put to a vote as a separate bill later 
in the year. 
</P>
<P>
Bryan's bill would require a 20% improvement in fuel efficiency by the 1995 
model year, and fleet averages of 40 m.p.g. for the 2001 model year. 
</P>
<P>
In the House, meanwhile, Rep. Claudine Schneider (R-R.I) included a 45-m.p.g. 
requirement in an omnibus global-warming bill. After that bill was referred to 
11 House committees for consideration, Schneider and Rep. Barbara Boxer 
(D-Greenbrae) introduced a separate fuel efficiency measure, now before the 
Energy and Commerce Committee, to raise the fleet average figure to 45 m.p.g. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
The Outlook 
</P>
<P>
"The climate," said Bryan, "is much improved for favorable action. Once again a 
crisis has pointed up our vulnerability, and people are asking how we got into 
this again so soon." 
</P>
<P>
Nevertheless, he said, industry opposition confronts the bill with an uphill 
fight, even though it addresses both global warming and energy independence. 
</P>
<P>
On the other hand, environmental groups are launching campaigns in support of 
the bill. 
</P>
<P>
"Right now, we are being held hostage by both Iraq and Detroit," the Sierra 
Club's Becker said.
