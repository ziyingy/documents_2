The Ocean View High School girls' basketball team erased any doubts Thursday 
night about it being a contender for the Sunset league basketball title. 
</P>
<P>
Senior guard Cossette Smith's free throw with 33 seconds left helped Ocean View 
hold off Fountain Valley, 26-25, in a league game at Fountain Valley. 
</P>
<P>
The victory was the second in 6 days for Ocean View over Fountain Valley. Last 
Friday, Ocean View squeezed by the Barons, 47-46, in the championship game of 
the Edison-Marina girls' tournament. 
</P>
<P>
"We knew coming into the game that Fountain Valley would be fired up," Ocean 
View Coach Ollie Martin said. "Everything was against us from the start, but we 
stayed together and battled the entire game." 
</P>
<P>
Ocean View improves its record to 15-2 overall, 2-0 in league. Fountain Valley, 
last year's league champions and favored to repeat, is 9-7, 1-1.

The Seahawks built a 15-8 halftime lead in a game where both teams struggled 
offensively. The Barons came out more aggressive in the third quarter and tied 
the score, 17-17, on lay-in by senior center Danielle Barlow. 
</P>
<P>
Barlow and teammate Renae Lambrigger led the comeback. The Barons led, 22-21, 
with less than 6 minutes to play on a 3-point play by Barlow, a layup and a 
free throw. Lambrigger added 6 of her game-high 10 points and 5 of her 8 
rebounds in the second half. 
</P>
<P>
With just 3:10 to play, Ocean View's Fabiola Nunez scored on a layup to give 
the Seahawks a 25-22 advantage. Lambrigger then cut the lead to 25-24 with a 
pull-up jumper, but the Barons could not convert in the final minutes. 
</P>
<P>
Sullivan's free throw gave Ocean View a 2-point lead. Lambrigger made a free 
throw with 11 seconds left to make the score 26-25, but her last-second shot 
was rejected by Sullivan.

rebounds for Fountain Valley.
