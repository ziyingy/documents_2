Katherine Weatherill was leafing through the morning paper Tuesday when she saw 
the story and lost control. 
</P>
<P>
"My first impulse was rage," she recalled. "I couldn't believe it. The 
insurance companies had won again at our expense." 
</P>
<P>
Weatherill and her husband, Bill, a retired aerospace engineer, are among 
several hundred homeowners who in recent years have waged a costly and 
emotionally draining legal struggle with insurance carriers to win compensation 
for damage to their homes in La Palma, Cypress and parts of southeast Los 
Angeles County. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Walls, Foundations Crack 
</P>
<P>
Like many neighbors in the 27-year-old tract on La Palma's west side, the 
Weatherills have witnessed the foundation of their two-story home bulge and 
break apart and seen cracks appear on interior walls. 
</P>
<P>
Theories about the cause are as numerous as reports of damage in the 
upper-middle-class neighborhood of single-family homes. 
</P>
<P>
But there is little disagreement among the Weatherills and their friends on 
Bellhaven Street as to who should pay to repair their homes: insurance 
companies. 
</P>
<P>
That's why Weatherill's emotions boiled over Tuesday as she read the paper. In 
San Francisco, the U.S. 9th Circuit Court of Appeals had upheld a lower-court 
decision that denied insurance benefits to another La Palma couple who filed a 
claim after finding cracks in the foundation of their home. 
</P>
<P>
The claim was denied by State Farm Fire &amp; Casualty Co., which said the 
damage was caused, at least in part, by earth movement, specifically the 
expansion and contraction of the soil under their foundation -- a condition 
excluded from coverage in their homeowners policy. 
</P>
<P>
The couple argued that earth movement is the result of sulfates in the soil, 
allegedly a condition covered by the policy. 
</P>
<P>
But State Farm maintained that because non-covered earth movement caused the 
cracks, it had the right to withhold benefits, no matter what other factors 
contributed to the earth movement. 
</P>
<P>
This position has been widely adopted in the industry, with an estimated 90% of 
homeowner policies in California today incorporating the principle. 
</P>
<P>
Monday's ruling was widely viewed in legal circles as a significant victory for 
insurers because it may further limit the companies' obligation to make good on 
claims of property damage. A federal court interpreting state law cannot bind 
state courts, but its rulings can be influential. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
March 30 Ruling on Damage 
</P>
<P>
On March 30, in another blow to policyholders, the state Supreme Court limited 
the ability of homeowners to collect property damage caused by landslides, 
earthquakes or other natural disasters by ruling that insurance companies must 
pay only when a policy covers the "predominant" or primary cause of the damage. 
</P>
<P>
Coverage for disasters is excluded under most standard policies, also called 
"all-risk" policies. 
</P>
<P>
But some lower courts have held that homeowners can collect benefits when 
damage results from a combination of covered risks, such as faulty 
construction, or uncovered risks, such as earthslides. 
</P>
<P>
San Francisco-based attorney Patrick E. Catalano, who specializes in insurance 
litigation, said Monday's decision could further erode the value of homeowner 
insurance policies. 
</P>
<P>
"The court has taken the position that your homeowner's policy is basically 
worth only the paper it is written on," he said. "And that may not be much 
anymore." 
</P>
<P>
Representatives of several major insurance companies disagreed and 
characterized dire warnings of reduced coverage as political hype meant to 
rally the public against an industry already under fire on several fronts. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
'Bash the Insurance Industry' 
</P>
<P>
"It has become fashionable to bash the insurance industry," a State Farm 
spokesman said, "and there are those who will take this ruling and run with it, 
attempting to make great hay at our expense. In our eyes, the ruling simply 
defined a gray area in the law, and from that standpoint it was important." 
</P>
<P>
The significance of Monday's ruling was not lost on Weatherill. 
</P>
<P>
She and her husband bought their five-bedroom house 26 years ago. It was their 
ticket to retirement, an investment they hoped to cash out once their two 
children had grown and Weatherill's husband retired from aerospace work. The 
children have grown, and Bill Weatherill quit work at Northrop last year. 
</P>
<P>
But the couple said they cannot sell the house, not with a crumbling foundation 
and cracks throughout. 
</P>
<P>
"It's distressed property," Katherine Weatherill said. "No one is going to buy 
it, not unless they are a gambler, a contractor or crazy." 
</P>
<P>
The Weatherills own one of 426 homes built by the Landmark Co. in the middle 
1960s in La Palma. A decade later, many of the homeowners began to notice 
cracked tiles, bulges in the floors and fissures on walls. 
</P>
<P>
In some homes, the damage was so severe the owners had to move out while 
extensive reconstruction costing up to $100,000 was completely. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
200 Homes Rehabilitated 
</P>
<P>
Ann Polonis, president of the development's homeowner association, said about 
200 homes in the area have undergone rehabilitation in recent years. But she 
said scores of homeowners such as herself have done nothing, because they have 
been trying to settle claims with their insurance carriers. 
</P>
<P>
"It has been a long, long struggle for most of us," said Polonis, who estimated 
that it will cost $130,000 to $150,000 to fix the foundation, plumbing and 
walls in her home. "The house needs paint on the outside. But I'm not going to 
put one dime into this place." 
</P>
<P>
Geologists, soil scientists and engineers have generally agreed that the 
problems stem from the soil. But the exact cause is still unknown. 
</P>
<P>
Some say the soil contains too much clay; others believe it contains too much 
sand. Like a sand castle that crumbles when it dries, sandy soil may shift as 
it alternately becomes wet and dry. 
</P>
<P>
Still others blame sulfates in the soil. Polonis said they have "eaten away" 
the concrete foundations, driveways and decks supporting the homes. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
$350,000 Study of Soil 
</P>
<P>
To pinpoint the cause and perhaps shed light on who is ultimately responsible, 
a $350,000 study of soil conditions in the area is under way by Cal State Long 
Beach scientists. Assemblywoman Doris Allen (R-Cypress), whose district 
includes La Palma, introduced a bill last year that paid for the investigation. 
</P>
<P>
"It is about time we get some answers," Allen said Tuesday from Sacramento. 
Reacting to Monday's appeals court decision, she said it is unfortunate that 
people buy homeowner policies, believing that they are adequately covered, when 
they are not. 
</P>
<P>
But Tustin attorney Robert E. Beekman, who is representing 62 La Palma 
homeowners in cases against insurance carriers, blames state lawmakers for 
failing to stand up to insurers. He said the Legislature, influenced by the 
insurance lobby, has not taken the initiative to make insurers respond to 
public needs. 
</P>
<P>
"The courts," Beekman said, "are not the appropriate place to decide disputes 
of public policy, like insurance questions."
