What I found most interesting in the drug discussion was not what was said, but 
rather what wasn't said by any of the "experts." Not one pointed to the real 
reason why drugs have become a major plague in American society -- the 
powerless and alienation that millions of Americans feel toward their 
institutions.

Before the 1970s, most of the drug users in black communities were musicians 
and a small group of street-corner junkies. Among whites, drug abuse was 
largely confined to Skid Row dropouts and a handful of wealthy entertainers. 
But Vietnam and Watergate changed that. Lawbreaking and the arrogance of power 
by business and government officials bred a deep cynicism in American society.

To escape the feeling of a growing sense of discontent, millions of Americans 
turned to drugs as an attractive means of escape and fulfillment.

The drug crisis is a product of the profound social, economic and spiritual 
void in present-day America. More police, prisons, tougher laws, or even 
legalization will not solve the problem. 
</P>
<P>
The only real solution to the drug crisis is for Americans to have power and 
control over their lives and institutions. Anything less only dances around the 
issue. And that's what your "experts" did.
