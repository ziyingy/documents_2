A small Huntington Park casino, the target of a criminal investigation, filed 
for protection under Chapter 11 of the federal Bankruptcy Act just as county 
officials moved to collect $400,000 in delinquent property taxes and penalties, 
officials said Monday.

<P>
Huntington Park Club Operations Ltd., part owner and operator of the Huntington 
Park Casino, owes its 20 largest creditors $610,382, according to the 
bankruptcy petition filed Friday in U.S. Bankruptcy Court in Los Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
The petition did not list the back taxes owed to the county. 
</P>
<P>
The club is the subject of an investigation by sheriff's detectives into 
alleged skimming of profits and violation of the minimum-wage law. However, the 
bankruptcy filing is unlikely to have any effect on the probe.

Huntington Park Casino, which opened in 1984, accumulated the property tax debt 
over the last five years, said Deputy County Counsel Martha E. Romero.

<P>
Romero said county officials have tried for several years to get the tax matter 
resolved. They notified casino management last week that they planned on Monday 
to begin an inventory of the casino's possessions, including gaming tables and 
cash registers, and seize them as collateral, Romero said. 
</P>
<P>
The county would have had the right to sell the casino's possessions if the tax 
bill went unpaid, but Romero said she wanted to work out a payment plan with 
casino officials.
