In a major civil rights action, the Justice Department on Thursday sued to 
overturn Georgia's requirement that a candidate for public office must win a 
majority in primary and general elections or face a runoff. 
</P>
<P>
The practice has had "a demonstrably chilling effect on the ability of blacks 
to become candidates for public office," said John R. Dunne, assistant attorney 
general for civil rights. The state's majority-vote requirement, similar to 
that of eight other Southern states, is "an electoral steroid for white 
candidates," he added. 
</P>
<P>
California, like 40 other states, has a plurality requirement for primary and 
general elections, in which the candidate who gathers the most votes is 
nominated or elected. 
</P>
<P>
The government in its suit plans to cite elections in more than 20 Georgia 
counties where at least 35 black candidates won the most votes in their initial 
primaries, but then lost in runoffs as voters coalesced around a white 
opponent. The suit was filed in federal court in Atlanta. 
</P>
<P>
Some political scientists who specialize in Southern voting patterns said that 
the elimination of the rule will help Republicans, because black candidates 
will more frequently land the Democrat Party's primary nomination, thus pushing 
conservative whites toward Republicans in the general election. 
</P>
<P>
"I would suggest the Republican Justice Department in the name of minority 
rights is pursuing policies that will help Republicans," said Larry Sabato, a 
University of Virginia political scientist. 
</P>
<P>
But Dunne said there was no consideration or discussion of possible political 
fallout from the suit. He said he made a pro forma mention of the suit to Atty. 
Gen. Dick Thornburgh and that he knew of no discussions of the action with the 
White House. He added that he would be surprised if there had been.

Rob McDuff, a project attorney with the Lawyers Committee for Civil Rights, 
praised the suit -- the first statewide challenge by the Justice Department to 
a majority-vote requirement -- as "a really good sign. It shows that the 
Justice Department, unlike under the (Ronald) Reagan Administration, is going 
to be vigorous in challenging discrimination in voting." 
</P>
<P>
The suit alleges that the majority-vote requirement violates the Voting Rights 
Act of 1965 and the 14th and 15th amendments to the Constitution "because it 
was adopted and has been maintained for racially discriminatory purposes." 
</P>
<P>
Dunne, discussing the suit with reporters, said the Georgia law was adopted in 
1964 "for the purpose of impairing the voting strength of minorities." He said 
the sponsor of the legislation, former Georgia House leader Denmark Groover, 
had acknowledged in a sworn statement that the purpose was to dilute the power 
of blacks voting as a bloc. 
</P>
<P>
Blacks, while constituting 26.5% of Georgia's population and 24% of its 
voting-age population, make up less than 10% of elected officials in the state, 
Dunne noted. 
</P>
<P>
"Voting in the state of Georgia is racially polarized," the Justice Department 
said in the suit. "White voters rarely vote for black candidates or candidates 
identified with black interests, while these candidates generally receive 
significant support from black voters." 
</P>
<P>
"The majority-vote requirement in the context of racially polarized voting has 
had racially discriminatory results on black candidates in Georgia, since white 
citizens constitute a majority of the voters in most electoral contests," the 
government alleged. 
</P>
<P>
Bills were introduced in the Georgia Legislature in 1986 and 1989 to replace 
the majority-vote requirement with a plurality for nomination or election. But 
neither was enacted. 
</P>
<P>
"Georgia has refused to abandon the majority-vote requirement, even though 
state officials have known, or should have known, that the majority-vote 
requirement has denied and continues to deny black voters an equal opportunity 
to participate in the political process and elect candidates of their choice," 
the suit alleged. 
</P>
<P>
Dunne said the Justice Department came upon the evidence that led to the suit 
last April when it refused to clear under the Voting Rights Act Georgia's 
system for electing superior court judges. In that matter, Dunne said that 
black voting strength was diluted by Georgia's use of at-large circuit 
elections that required a majority vote for victory. 
</P>
<P>
A suit filed by the American Civil Liberties Union for Georgia state Rep. 
Tyrone Brooks seeks to throw out the majority-vote requirement in every county 
of the state. 
</P>
<P>
The Justice Department suit named as defendants Gov. Joe Frank Harris, the 
state board of elections, Secretary of State Max Cleland and various officials 
of DeKalb County. The county officials were cited as a class representing 
similar officials in counties where the government alleges that the majority 
requirement acts to dilute the voting strength of blacks. 
</P>
<P>
The eight other states with majority vote requirements are South Carolina, 
Florida, Alabama, Mississippi, Louisiana, Oklahoma, Arkansas and Texas. North 
Carolina recently shifted to a 40% plurality requirement.
