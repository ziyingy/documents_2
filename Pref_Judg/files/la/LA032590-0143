In rebuttal to the Feb. 18 commentary by Gary D. Suttle ("A Nowhere Road for 
$40 Million Plus"), I have lived in the Grantville area since 1967 and traffic 
through our community gets worse every day.

Mission Gorge Road from East County to Mission Valley is a disaster. 
</P>
<P>
Traffic is usually very heavy Monday through Saturday. Main streets of 
Grantville and Allied Gardens like Zion Avenue, Waring Road and Twain Avenue 
are heavily traveled. For me to enter Twain from a side street during the work 
week from 6:30 a.m. to 8 a.m. is impossible. I must find an opening and streak 
out on Twain heading west to Mission Gorge Road. 
</P>
<P>
After I reach Twain and Mission Gorge Road, I must go through three signals to 
reach Interstate 8. The traffic is so heavy in the morning it takes 15 minutes 
to reach the freeway just from Twain -- and that's when there's no accident or 
construction, otherwise you can triple the time. 
</P>
<P>
I know for a fact that people from East County use our side streets of Allied 
Gardens and Grantville to run parallel with the freeway. They make better time.

Opening the Jackson Drive extension would relieve traffic congestion in all 
what we call District 7. People who need to get to north city could take 
Jackson, relieving traffic from Mission Gorge Road and I-8. People in East 
County and Del Cerro/Navajo could take Jackson to get to the freeway at 
California 52. We voted for the funds to build Jackson Drive -- the voters 
expect it to be built. 
</P>
<P>
We have a traffic problem and we need roads like Jackson Drive. It will improve 
many people's quality of life throughout San Diego by helping reduce traffic on 
I-8 and our residential streets.
