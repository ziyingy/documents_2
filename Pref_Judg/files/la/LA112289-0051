Icy wind blasted down trees and power lines from the Great Lakes to North 
Carolina and whipped more than a foot of snow into squalls that stopped drivers 
cold in northern New England. Two forest fires sparked by downed power lines 
burned out of control in Virginia. The weather was blamed for seven deaths. The 
wind and cold were backlashes of an intense storm that crossed New York and New 
England on Monday. The National Weather Service posted blizzard warnings for 
New Hampshire and most of Maine, where snow accumulations of up to 15 inches 
were expected.
