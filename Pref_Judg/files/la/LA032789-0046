"I cry with you once more . . . we cannot seem to rouse our leaders to realize 
we are in a crisis," declared Bishop Paul Moore Jr., 69, in his final Easter 
sermon before retiring as head of the Episcopal diocese of New York. Moore was 
criticizing insensitivity to the plight of the poor in his sermon at the 
Cathedral of St. John the Divine. Moore, born to a wealthy family, has pursued 
an activist and liberal agenda as a clergyman, working with the poor, 
participating in the civil rights movement, leading a peace mission to Saigon 
in 1970 and traveling to Moscow in 1982 to promote nuclear disarmament. In 
1977, he ordained a homosexual man as an Episcopal priest.
