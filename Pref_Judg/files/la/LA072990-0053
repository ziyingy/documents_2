Tsai Sung-Hui, pastor of one of Taipei's most popular Buddhist temples, is 
personally in charge of hundreds of infant ghosts. 
</P>
<P>
His Mercy Temple offers help to the growing number of Taiwan women who have 
taken the painful decision to abort a pregnancy: For a fee it will care for the 
souls of the aborted babies and ensure that they do not return to haunt their 
mothers. 
</P>
<P>
The temple says its "baby spirit" program helps handle a supernatural problem 
created by Taiwan's headlong rush to "modernity"; as more women shrug off 
traditional ideas about sex, the abortion rate has skyrocketed. 
</P>
<P>
But Tsai's temple has created a rare debate in Taiwan's normally serene 
Buddhist community, as nuns and scholars accuse him of using religion to cheat 
distraught women. 
</P>
<P>
"He tries to terrorize women," said Chao Hui, a Buddhist nun who has led the 
drive against the Mercy Temple. "He uses their feelings of sorrow and guilt to 
make money." 
</P>
<P>
The argument over "baby spirits" is typical of modern Taiwan, where age-old 
folk beliefs exist side by side with the latest technology. 
</P>
<P>
Businessmen take care to position their computers in such a way as not to 
offend the gods, and secretaries from air-conditioned office blocks scurry to 
temples on their lunch break to light incense. 
</P>
<P>
Baby spirits are not new to Taiwan's believers, but reports of hauntings have 
become more common as the abortion rate rises. 
</P>
<P>
Taiwan legalized abortion in 1985. 
</P>
<P>
The Taipei Family Planning Center said 110,000 abortions were registered last 
year on the island of 20 million people, many of whom are too embarrassed to 
buy contraceptives. 
</P>
<P>
Vincent Kang, secretary of the center, said the real number of abortions is 
probably higher because many private clinics and doctors do not report 
abortions to health authorities. "We can definitely say abortion is on the 
rise," he said. 
</P>
<P>
He added, "People still have problems with it. Otherwise, why would there be 
all this fuss about baby spirits?" 
</P>
<P>
According to the Mercy Temple, the spirits of aborted babies harass the living 
in a number of ways, ranging from disturbing sleep with spectral cries to 
ruining business deals, souring love affairs and prompting suicides. 
</P>
<P>
"Because they are not properly cared for, infant spirits cannot be reincarnated 
and turn hateful. They often cause troubles in the material world," the temple 
said in one of its advertisements. 
</P>
<P>
People who fear they are being plagued by baby spirits have a number of 
options. Many women simply hope that contributions to the Mercy Temple will 
placate the ghosts and solve their problems. 
</P>
<P>
For a fee of $110 the temple will name the "unborn child," light incense for 
its soul twice a day and hold special religious services four times a year. 
</P>
<P>
Some people, however, find spirit babies more expensive. One Taipei executive 
in a high-technology company felt it necessary to rent an apartment to house 
the ghosts of several unborn children he believed were preventing his wife from 
conceiving again. 
</P>
<P>
Taiwan's Buddhist Establishment has taken pains to distance itself from the 
Mercy Temple, saying "baby spirits" are not part of traditional Buddhist 
doctrine. 
</P>
<P>
"(This) is not only not a part of local belief, it actually conflicts with 
local belief," Chang Hsun, a researcher at Academica Sinica, wrote in an essay. 
</P>
<P>
"They are twisting the Buddhist concept of reincarnation. . . . They are 
oversimplifying the whole issue of life and death," said Chao, an officer of 
the Buddhist Assn. of the Republic of China. 
</P>
<P>
Tsai resists the strict interpretation. 
</P>
<P>
"Who is to say what is Buddhist? There are many different kinds of Buddhism," 
he said in a brief telephone interview before hanging up.
