A Newhall woman with a history of six drunk-driving arrests went on trial 
Tuesday in the death of a Canadian motorcyclist she allegedly ran down while 
driving drunk on the Golden State Freeway in Sun Valley last fall. 
</P>
<P>
Patricia Lee Giunta, 41, is charged in San Fernando Superior Court with 
vehicular manslaughter and felony drunk driving in connection with the Oct. 4, 
1989, death of David Jaggs, 24. 
</P>
<P>
Jaggs was riding his motorcycle about 8:30 p.m. with his wife, Janine, 21, when 
they were struck from behind by a truck driven by Giunta, prosecutors said. 
</P>
<P>
Jaggs and his wife were thrown from the motorcycle and run over by the truck, 
prosecutors said. 
</P>
<P>
Jaggs died later that night. His wife was seriously injured. 
</P>
<P>
The couple had been married a month earlier and had moved to the Los Angeles 
area to attend college. 
</P>
<P>
According to court records, Giunta had a blood-alcohol level of 0.29% -- more 
than three times the level at which a person is considered legally drunk -- 
shortly after the accident. 
</P>
<P>
The arrest was Giunta's fifth for drunk driving since 1974, according to court 
records. 
</P>
<P>
She was arrested a sixth time while free on bail after the fatal accident. 
</P>
<P>
In all but one case, the drunk-driving charges were either reduced or dismissed 
because she has been able to manipulate the court system, prosecutors said. 
</P>
<P>
Her one conviction for drunk driving came in 1983, when Giunta was sentenced by 
a Pasadena judge to three years probation and ordered to perform community 
service. 
</P>
<P>
A judge in West Covina reduced a 1974 drunk-driving charge to a minor traffic 
violation, according to Deputy Dist. Atty. Jacquelyn Lacey, who is prosecuting 
Giunta in the current case. 
</P>
<P>
Giunta was given probation and ordered to pay a fine. 
</P>
<P>
In a March, 1989, case, two breath tests showed Giunta's blood-alcohol level 
was 0.16% and 0.17% after she ran into another vehicle. 
</P>
<P>
Officers found an open bottle of vodka in Giunta's car, but Giunta said she 
began drinking the liquor after the collision because she was so upset. 
</P>
<P>
Jurors failed to reach a verdict and the charge was dismissed. 
</P>
<P>
Another drunk-driving charge from Alhambra was dropped in June, 1989. 
</P>
<P>
And she was acquitted in August of the drunk-driving charge brought while she 
was free on bail in the accident that killed Jaggs. 
</P>
<P>
In both those cases, prosecutors lacked evidence necessary to convict Giunta 
because she refused to submit to blood-alcohol tests, Lacey said. 
</P>
<P>
Law enforcement officers cannot force a drunk-driving suspect to submit to 
blood-alcohol tests unless the person is suspected of a felony in which someone 
has been injured or killed, Lacey said. 
</P>
<P>
Lacey said California Highway Patrol officers had to hold Giunta down while 
they administered the test after her arrest in October, 1989. 
</P>
<P>
She is being held in lieu of $100,000 bail. 
</P>
<P>
Robert Fernandez, Giunta's attorney in most of her cases, could not be reached 
for comment Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
In testimony Tuesday, Roland Corado, a witness to the fatal accident, said 
David and Janine Jaggs were thrown from their motorcycle and as they were 
dragged by Giunta's truck, Jaggs "was twisted like a pretzel."
