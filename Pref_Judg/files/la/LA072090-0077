As Carmine Sabatini, the Little Italy "importer" in "The Freshman" who bears a 
striking resemblance to Vito Corleone, Marlon Brando pulls off a minor miracle. 
By all rights, watching America's finest actor parody one of his greatest roles 
should be a sorry spectacle -- a sign of artistic bankruptcy. Brando acts so 
infrequently that, when he does, you want him to do something great, something 
fresh. 
</P>
<P>
Except that he does indeed do something fresh. The role is nothing more than an 
elaborate comic turn, but he invests it with such sly knowingness and reserves 
of feeling that he gives this dinky joke-book movie a soul. Brando is doing 
here what a lot of famous actors probably wish they could do to the roles that 
made them famous (or, in Brando's case, famous again). He's using the gravity 
of his performance in "The Godfather" for comic effect, bringing out the 
absurdity that was always just under the surface of the role. 
</P>
<P>
For years, Brando's Godfather was perhaps the most heavily parodied of all 
contemporary performances. (The take-offs were a back-handed tribute.) Why 
shouldn't Brando join in the fun? What "The Freshman" demonstrates is that 
Brando can parody himself better than any of his imitators -- and still appear 
as regal as ever. 
</P>
<P>
With a Brando impersonator playing Carmine, "The Freshman" (rated PG) would 
have been a lot skimpier. It's pretty skimpy anyway and yet, just when you've 
had it with the mistimed scenes and the clunky direction, writer-director 
Andrew Bergman comes through with an inspired piece of lunacy. 
</P>
<P>
Technically, the movie is a step back from Bergman's last film, "So Fine." As 
hilarious as that movie often was, it was his directorial debut, and he was 
just learning the ropes. In "The Freshman," (citywide), Bergman is still 
learning the ropes, but at least he's canny enough to cast actors (besides 
Brando) who are loose enough to respond to the script's japery. The performers' 
comic instincts are liberated by the free-wheeling goofiness.

Matthew Broderick plays Clark Kellogg, a Vermont kid who enrolls in the NYU 
Film School. When his bags are stolen on his way from the airport, Clark tracks 
down the penny ante crook (Bruno Kirby), who fast-talks his way into making 
amends by giving Clark a job introduction with his uncle Carmine. The job turns 
out to be smuggling into the country a Komodo dragon -- a giant lizard on the 
endangered species list. (An equally large, unendangered monitor lizard was 
substituted.) 
</P>
<P>
Now any movie that hinges on a smuggled giant lizard is definitely worth a 
look-see. And so is any movie that features Bert Parks as an emcee who croons 
to his swank assemblage, "There she is, your Komodo dragon." Parks also gets to 
sing "Tequila," from under an outsized sombrero, and "Maggie's Farm," in a 
version that will probably have Bob Dylan crying into his harmonica.

Maximilian Schell turns up as a martinet chef with a Dr. Strangelove accent. As 
the NYU film professor who projects scenes from "The Godfather II" to his class 
and ecstatically mouths the actors' words, Paul Benedict is a inspired loon. 
Bergman, before he became a screenwriter ("Blazing Saddles," "The In-Laws"), 
published a doctoral thesis on American movies during the Depression. That may 
explain the affectionate-satiric tone in Benedict's scenes. This fatuous, 
trivia-engorged prof is probably Bergman's worst-case image of what he might 
have become if he had stayed in academia. 
</P>
<P>
It's a pity there isn't more film-school satire. We never get a sense of what 
kind of filmmaker Clark wants to be, what movies he likes. It's an 
undernourished role in general, and Broderick, funny and proficient as he 
sometimes is, seems miscast; he's too old, and too smart-looking, to be playing 
callow country boys. 
</P>
<P>
But he has a genuine rapport with Brando, and that gives the movie a real lift 
in their scenes together. Clark's father died when he was a kid; his stepfather 
is a bullying animal activist fanatic who cares little about his stepson, and 
so it makes sense that Clark would respond to Carmine's courtly, patrician 
largess. There's a wayward subplot about Carmine trying to marry off Clark with 
his sexually avid daughter (Penelope Ann Miller), his only child, but the 
surrogate father/son relationship between the two men is the film's emotional 
core. 
</P>
<P>
In Brando's best scene, Carmine, suspecting Clark is going to betray him to the 
feds, walks in on the boy in his dorm room and tries to strike a human 
connection. It's comical to see this bulky Mafioso in a dormitory, but, the way 
Brando plays it, it's also mysteriously moving. It's as if Carmine, without his 
royal trappings, had been reduced to a tender, beseeching old man.
