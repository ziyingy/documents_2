<P>
Dr. Tom Rusk, a San Diego psychiatrist and author of self-help books, has never 
met Billy Al Bengston, the acclaimed Venice painter whose work is identified 
with the "L.A. Look" or "Cool School" that established Los Angeles as a major 
art center in the early 1960s. 
</P>
<P>
But Rusk, a clinical associate professor at UC San Diego School of Medicine who 
deals in the logic of science, and Bengston, a motorcycle aficionado and 
renounced surfer whose major frame of reference is presumably visual and 
unstructured, both find themselves drawn to the sea. 
</P>
<P>
In describing this aspect of their personalities, the psychiatrist and the 
artist speak different languages. But they are talking about the same thing. 
</P>
<P>
From somewhere within the psyches of Bengston, Rusk and an undetermined -- but, 
some researchers agree, very large -- number of other people emanates a need to 
live near water. 
</P>
<P>
Somewhere between an attraction and a compulsion, the feeling of being drawn to 
water has been noted by observers of the human condition down through the ages. 
Surprisingly, the phenomenon seems not to have inspired so much as a shred of 
scientific research. 
</P>
<P>
Indeed, a problem with all of these assumptions, Rusk conceded, is that there 
has never been a research study that explored the attraction -- primal or not 
-- of water or bodies of water to the human psyche. Neither a database search 
of the literature of mental health research, conducted by Claremont Graduate 
School psychology professor Robert Gable, nor three such searches conducted by 
The Times could find evidence of any study ever appearing in a scientific 
journal. 
</P>
<P>
"The most ignored area of human psychology is the study of human feelings," 
Rusk said. "It is so ignored that the bastions of science in our country almost 
totally ignore the study of feelings. So feelings are left to psychoanalytic 
theory, which everyone decries as non-scientific -- and I'm not arguing to the 
contrary. Science doesn't tend to study things having to do with feelings 
because feelings are, by definition, subjective." 
</P>
<P>
To get at the innate feelings humans have about water, he concludes, "you're 
going to have a lot more interesting and edifying conversations with poets than 
you're going to have with scientists." 
</P>
<P>
In the absence of hard data, then, there is disagreement over whether oceans 
alone fill this need. Many observers believe that other large bodies of water, 
like the Great Lakes, and even major rivers suffice. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
An Evolutionary Throwback? 
</P>
<P>
There are other disagreements. One of them is over whether this is a primal 
attraction somehow organically imprinted in people -- perhaps a throwback to 
the evolutionary origins of human beings as water creatures or even, in a more 
Freudian sense, a latent effect of being snugly afloat in the womb. 
</P>
<P>
Observers who agree that many humans share an inner need to be near water, but 
who don't accept such primal explanations, suggest that it is an acquired 
taste, motivated by economic and other pragmatic considerations. 
</P>
<P>
Betty Graham, manager of two Jon Douglas Co. realty offices in Malibu, for 
instance, said that in the economic climate there, the price of property more 
than doubles on the ocean side of Pacific Coast Highway compared to the inland 
exposure yards away. But whether this is because of the primal draw of the 
water, or the urge to cash in on it, is open to question. 
</P>
<P>
To Bengston, 54, the first clues to his own primal attraction to the sea came 
when he was 15 and his parents decided to leave the home of Bengston's birth in 
Dodge City, Kan., and head west. They didn't stop until they got to California. 
The son they raised says now that he cannot imagine ever existing more than a 
short distance from the ocean. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Meeting of Land and Sea 
</P>
<P>
The ocean has been a consistent subject in Bengston's work for 20 years. 
Starting in about 1970, he began treating underwater subjects after he became 
fascinated by skin diving. Beginning in 1974, he turned his attention to the 
surface and, specifically, to the meeting of land, sea and air -- an artistic 
direction that appears to emanate from preoccupation with what Rusk calls 
interfaces. 
</P>
<P>
In a telephone interview from Hawaii, where Bengston maintains a second 
residence, the artist reflected on the necessity he feels to live near the 
ocean. 
</P>
<P>
"The way I've always thought about it is of the ocean being a terminal 
situation," he said. "You go as far as you can go on land and the ocean is the 
end of it, a stopping point . . . usually with a clear vista. 
</P>
<P>
"There's something that's comforting about it. I have been inland on various 
occasions. I never feel very comfortable. Palm Springs gives me the hives. I 
like the desert, but I never feel comfortable with that unless (the desert) is 
right up against the ocean, like in Baja California." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
An Expert's Theory 
</P>
<P>
Bengston isn't familiar with psychiatric jargon. But, to Rusk, Bengston's words 
perfectly illustrate the psychiatrist's basic explanation of why the ocean in 
particular, and large bodies of water in general, seem inwardly important. His 
theory is that human life at many levels, starting at the edges of a single 
cell, focuses on what Rusk calls "interfaces" -- places where one key element 
butts up against another. 
</P>
<P>
He concedes the terminology borrows from contemporary computerspeak, but he 
says the word makes its own point. "You can look at it sort of in a cosmic or 
even a biological sense," said Rusk, "that everything that's important occurs 
at interfaces -- the interface between two entities or things that we have in 
our mind. 
</P>
<P>
"It is not the center of the sun that is most critical, it is what happens (in 
the sun) at its outer edges. (The same is true of) the surfaces of cells." 
</P>
<P>
Rusk thinks mountaintops are interfaces, too, but he contends that the 
interface of land with water has a quintessentially primal attraction. This may 
be, he said, for more Freudian reasons. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
'Most Fundamental Thing' 
</P>
<P>
"Next to air, water is the most fundamental thing we need," he said. "Think 
about flotation tanks and what that feels like. There is something very primal 
about that particular experience that is tremendously powerful. It touches on 
our memories of being suspended in water -- or, more accurately, amniotic 
fluid." 
</P>
<P>
"I think there is something extremely basic, or primitive, about water (the 
understanding of which) doesn't require you to be scientific. 
</P>
<P>
"Overlaying all that, there are very few people who can look at a magnificent 
sunset over the sea and not be moved. There is something universally moving 
about those vistas." 
</P>
<P>
To Edward Krupat, a visiting lecturer in psychology at Boston University, the 
interface concept makes a great deal of sense. "The manifest destiny was to get 
not to California, but to the ocean," he said. "It served as fulfillment. I 
think the issue of interfaces is inherently there. The end of land and the 
beginning of water are a port. It is an entry and an exit." 
</P>
<P>
"From the standpoint of people who explore, sighting land is the form of 
discovery or the end of a voyage. So I guess reaching water and reaching land 
can be major landmarks in some actual or symbolic form of journey." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
A Poet's View 
</P>
<P>
One poet who has pondered the need to inhabit the shoreline is Charles Wright, 
a widely published practitioner of his craft who teaches at the University of 
Virginia in Charlottesville. But for 17 years Wright lived in Laguna Beach, 
while he was on the faculty at UC Irvine. While the sea and its influence 
cannot be said to permeate his work, the ocean's voice is clearly heard in 
poems like "Laguna Blues" and "Laguna Dantesca," both of which are contained in 
an anthology first published in 1977 and titled "Southern Cross." 
</P>
<P>
"I moved to the sea because I got the job at Irvine, to be honest," said 
Wright. "But once I got there, I had that attraction for the sea. That's what I 
liked best about Laguna. I never once went into the ocean but I think there was 
something primal about it. 
</P>
<P>
"I am attracted to large bodies of water. I was born on a lake (in Tennessee). 
I never really got to the big stuff until I went to Monterey, Calif., in the 
Army (for language school). 
</P>
<P>
"Maybe I kept somehow wanting to go back toward it since I came out of it. I 
don't know. It was rather comforting to think that it was there. I liked to 
look at it. I liked the wind off of it. I didn't like the people around it. 
That's one of the problems about Southern California." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
The Historical Perspective 
</P>
<P>
On the other hand, Brian Fagan, a UC Santa Barbara anthropologist who is also 
an experienced sailor, believes that the practical role played by bodies of 
water in human civilization may have more to do with why people gravitated 
there than more subjective considerations. 
</P>
<P>
"Archeologically, there was evidence of people fishing and living by the ocean 
in Africa at least 115,000 years ago," he said. "That's a long time ago. Water 
has been an element in human life for that long. Humans have tended to live in 
places where there have been abundant and predictable resources, like fish. The 
very rich marine environment has always attracted human beings." 
</P>
<P>
Fagan believes this historical record of human behavior explains the sense of 
rapture for the sea. It's a sense he shares. 
</P>
<P>
"I couldn't envisage not living by the sea," he said. "I like to smell it and 
see it and sail on it. I lived for a while in Africa 600 miles from the nearest 
ocean. It drove me crazy. I feel a very strong pull. I think this pull is very 
common among human beings. (But) I think it's an adaptive mechanism." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
A Womb With a View 
</P>
<P>
Alan Dundes, a professor of anthropology and folklore at UC Berkeley, said a 
host of explanations may be appropriate for water love. 
</P>
<P>
"One theory along Freudian lines is that bodies of water are female," he said. 
"We are all born from a flood of fluid. There is the security of being drawn 
back to the womb and the womb includes water." 
</P>
<P>
The subject has, off and on, occupied the mind of Roger Revelle, a professor of 
science and public policy at UC San Diego and director emeritus of the Scripps 
Institution of Oceanography. Revelle said a whole complex of pragmatic 
characteristics -- the ocean's tendency to produce more equitable temperature 
ranges than inland areas, primarily -- and softer, more aesthetic 
considerations explain the attraction. 
</P>
<P>
"It is an object of beauty that people never tire of looking at," Revelle said. 
"One reason is that it's always changing. Summerset Maugham pointed out that 
you can't look at a beautiful object for more than a short time. 
</P>
<P>
"But you can look at the ocean almost indefinitely because it isn't always the 
same. The atmosphere over the sea and the froth on the surface are always 
different. It's an object of beauty that is not tiring." 
</P>
<P>
Predictably, some scientists throw cold water on the concept. Claremont's Gable 
is one of them. For two years, Gable lived in Malibu, in prime real estate 
between Pacific Coast Highway and the Pacific Ocean. 
</P>
<P>
Instead of liberated, the situation made Gable feel hemmed in. "I was trapped 
between the waves and the stream of traffic," he said. "I felt I was in a 
prison. It was a beautiful prison, but it was house arrest." 
</P>
