When some future archaeologists come to explore the battlefield on which 
abortion was waged during the late 20th Century, they'll have to dig through 
layers of words and decades of phrases. Semantics, they will discover, are the 
weapons with which this civil war is being fought. 
</P>
<P>
On this beleaguered turf, every capture of new territory is marked by the 
phrases that catch on. Every victory site is littered with the shells of 
propaganda that became part of our everyday language. 
</P>
<P>
In this linguistic dig, they will find banner phrases like "pro-choice" and 
"pro-life" -- words as loaded with meaning as any cannon. They will unearth 
debates between those who said "unborn child" and those who said "fetus." They 
will rediscover arguments between those who said "mother" and those who said 
"pregnant woman." 
</P>
<P>
And at the layer marked 1990, they may even see the shards of the most current 
phrase in the battle for the abortion middleground. One expression has 
infiltrated the media and the legislation this year: "abortion for birth 
control." 
</P>
<P>
I heard these words dozens of times before they hit my own language-alarm 
button. They came across my consciousness like a nail on a blackboard, abrasive 
but brief. Hold your ears and it will pass. 
</P>
<P>
But the phrase finally stuck in South Dakota when a local television anchor 
asked me what I thought about the "fact" that 90% of all abortions were done 
for birth control. Tape rolling, I asked my colleague: Did he believe that a 
woman literally chose abortion, that her preferred method of family planning 
was to place her feet in stirrups while a doctor put a vacuum aspirator into 
her body? My response never made the news. 
</P>

Abortion for birth control. The phrase was born in right-to-life publications 
as a deliberate attempt to capture the ambivalent majority. It appeared 
full-grown on legislation in Utah, Minnesota, Alabama, Idaho. It acquired 
respectability on television, in print, and in polling data. 
</P>
<P>
What does it mean? This week, Louisiana will hold hearings on two such bills 
that simply define every abortion -- except those for rape, incest, the life of 
the pregnant woman and, in one bill, fetal deformity -- as an "abortion for 
birth control." Abortion "for birth control" is verbal dressing for an old 
prohibition. But the phrase is also a kind of Rosetta stone for the abortion 
debate, circa 1990. 
</P>
<P>
This expression plays to the widespread belief that somewhere out there are 
women choosing abortion frivolously, sexually active women consciously choosing 
aspiration over a diaphragm, young and single women choosing termination 
because motherhood would be "inconvenient." 
</P>
<P>
"It's a new and improved packaging of an anti-abortion message," says Frances 
Kissling of Catholics for a Free Choice, "It's also a way of saying, 'We're not 
opposed to all abortions, only to these irresponsible abortions.' " 
</P>
<P>
After reading the polling data with a fine eye, political scientist Ethel Klein 
ties this into the general feeling that society is out of control. "Sexual 
irresponsibility has become a metaphor for irresponsibility in general. People 
want more boundaries and discipline. The immediate reaction is punitive." 
</P>
<P>
But abortion is used as birth control only in the most literal sense of those 
words: It prevents the birth of a child. In countries like the Soviet Union, 
where contraceptives are crude or unavailable, women are indeed forced to use 
abortion as the "method of family planning." But here, half of the women 
seeking abortions had used contraceptives during sex. A full 84% of women 
seeking abortions had none, or one, previously. 
</P>
<P>
In the 1960s, reminds Walter Dellinger of Duke University, people talked about 
"therapeutic" and "non-therapeutic" abortions. In the '70s and '80s, they 
talked about abortion "for convenience." The linguistic thread has followed a 
desire to distinguish good reasons from bad. And then to turn moral 
distinctions into laws. 
</P>
<P>
The problem, however, is in executing morals. If indeed we are to ban abortions 
"for birth control," how would we separate out the responsible from the 
irresponsible women? Have them bring their diaphragm or pill case to a 
tribunal? If we succeed in that, does motherhood become a punishment? 
Responsible women may have abortions while irresponsible women have children? 
</P>
<P>
Or, like the bills wending their way through Louisiana, do we define as 
frivolous the intimate, private details of more than a million strangers' lives 
a year? 
</P>
<P>
Whichever way the archaeologists cut through the language of this costly war of 
attrition, they will come upon the same powerful question pushing through all 
the fancy semantics: Who is going to decide?
