REUPHOLSTERING furniture has always been expensive. After World War II, 
returning GIs, unable to afford new furnishings, often slipcovered thrift-shop 
couches and armchairs. This "slipcovered look" soon went out of style. Today, 
however, slipcovers are so well designed that they appear to be upholstery. 
Styles in slipcovers range from elaborately structured designs to loose covers 
made like throws. Classic, fitted covers, says Don Ravitz of Dun Rite 
Upholstery in Van Nuys, "will always be in fashion." Traditional fabrics -- 
pliable, stain-resistant, pre-shrunk cottons just heavy enough to conceal 
what's under them -- are popular; these include country florals, stripes and 
ticking. These fabrics are sometimes quilted or tasseled. Some people prefer 
billowing "baggies" in white or pale linen, duck or canvas, augmented by 
gathers, swags, ties and floppy bows. Pullup chairs are often sheathed and 
aproned.

Mimi London, who carries slipcover fabrics in her Pacific Design Center 
showroom, uses draping Japanese couturier Jacquards on sofas and chairs and 
folds the fabric -- rather than cutting it -- "to achieve looseness."

New slipcovers should be dry-cleaned; thereafter, most fitted washables can be 
laundered in cool water and replaced damp without ironing.
