<P>
For American Indian students entering Cal State Northridge, prospects are poor: 
Chances are nearly 50-50 they will not return as sophomores, and only about one 
in five will graduate. 
</P>
<P>
Among ethnic groups on campus, only blacks stand a worse chance of graduating, 
university statistics indicate. 
</P>
<P>
Reasons for the high American Indian attrition are numerous. Some are cultural 
and some are financial. Although the college is given part of the blame, no one 
denies that similar problems exist at universities across the nation. 
</P>
<P>
"I used to tell my mother going to college was like walking through fire," said 
Lili Vidal, a CSUN graduate student of Cherokee descent. "It's like a foreign 
country. How people organize and live their lives is very different. . . . 
Think about what it would be like if you looked around and never saw yourself 
reflected in the real world." 
</P>
<P>
Over a 10-year period beginning in 1978, just 22% of American Indian students 
at CSUN graduated, according to a retention study done by the college's 
educational equity program. During those same years, only 15% of black students 
graduated, but the overall university average was 35%. 
</P>
<P>
The numbers from CSUN, while unsettling for Indian education experts, are 
similar to those at many other campuses. 
</P>
<P>
Although most of the largest national education organizations do not single out 
American Indians in studies because their numbers are so small, several smaller 
Indian education groups estimate national graduation rates range from 15% to 
20%. 
</P>
<P>
A study about Indian college dropouts published in 1985 by the UCLA Indian 
Studies Center and its former director, Prof. Charlotte Heth, a Cherokee, found 
significant differences between the perspectives of the educational 
institutions and of Indian groups on why students failed to graduate. 
</P>
<P>
In a survey of 107 academic institutions and organizations, she found the top 
three reasons were lack of motivation, lack of long-range or career goals and a 
fear of not being able to return home after being educated, either because 
students' families would not accept them or because they would no longer feel 
comfortable at home. 
</P>
<P>
In an identical survey of 117 Indian groups and tribal representatives, Heth 
found the top reason listed was that same fear of not being able to return 
home, followed by housing problems and alcohol or drug abuse. 
</P>
<P>
Charmaine Huntting, a UCLA law student who graduated from CSUN last spring, 
said she too worries that her education will drive a wedge between herself and 
her family and culture. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm the first person in my family who has ever even graduated high school," 
said Huntting, a Cherokee and Cruik who grew up in Los Angeles. "Even though I 
want to go into American Indian law, I tend to wonder whether they'll see me as 
being educated in a white man's world." 
</P>
<P>
Whether they have come from reservations or from urbanized families, Indians 
tend to follow tribal traditions of working in groups rather than alone, Indian 
scholars and activists said. Feelings of isolation and an aversion to 
competition are among the things that may cause them to drop out, they said. 
</P>
<P>
"Our way of living and our way of thinking does not permit a sense of 
competition. Our experience is one of cooperation," said Isaac Urquidi, a 
community social worker at the American Indian Counseling Center, run by the 
Los Angeles County Department of Mental Health. "We prefer to take a lower 
stand or a lower profile. That may lead people to think we are not 
intellectually capable of doing the work." 
</P>
<P>
At CSUN, other factors also are at work. American Indian students, former 
students, professors and past advisers said the strong cultural pull of family 
ties is one of the most common reasons students leave school. They said 
parents, many of whom have bad memories of their own attendance at federal 
Indian trade schools, may be less than enthusiastic about their offsprings' 
college goals. 
</P>
<P>
"There are times the students aren't sure themselves about what they're doing, 
which is not different from other students on campus. But the support network 
is entirely different," said Nancy Peterson Walter, a former part-time 
anthropology instructor and adviser to the American Indian Student Assn. 
"Grandparents, parents and others say, 'Why are you going to college anyway? 
You're just an Indian. Come home.' " 
</P>
<P>
Sister Grace Ann Rabideau, an Indian counselor at CSUN from 1972 to 1981 who 
now works at Valley College, said gaining a degree is so unimportant to some 
parents that students may quit just a class or two short of completion. 
</P>
<P>
Bill Givens, a member of the Oklahoma-based Cruik tribe, did that in 1977, 
after getting a C-minus in a public administration class required for his 
major. But after a 14-year hiatus, most of it spent working as a driver's 
training instructor, Givens, now 49, is back this fall, cramming for midterms. 
</P>
<P>
"I just didn't have the encouragement to do it before, and I didn't have the 
funds," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Like Jewish students, Indian students find that their tribal calendars are out 
of sync with the university's calendar, especially when a family member falls 
ill. 
</P>
<P>
When Sheryll Ryan Safian's father was diagnosed with leukemia in 1987, she said 
there was no question that she would travel to Oklahoma to participate in 
spring sun dances for him. 
</P>
<P>
"In order for the healing ceremonies to work, the people closest have 
responsibility to help out," Ryan Safian said. "I asked my father if he needed 
me and he said, 'Yes, quit school, I need you back here.' " 
</P>
<P>
Ryan Safian, a business major, had spent four years at CSUN. She plans to 
attend Valley College in the spring and then re-enroll at the university next 
fall. 
</P>
<P>
At a CSUN protest last month, students also complained that American Indians 
had no gathering place of their own. The Indian student association lost its 
room in the anthropology department in 1984 to a museum. Students also say they 
need an American Indian adviser to double as mentor and father confessor for 
the Indian students. 
</P>
<P>
Vicero said the museum has been closed and a new room for the association is 
drawn into the department's renovation plans, scheduled for completion in 
January. 
</P>
<P>
Because American Indian students tend to come from poor families, where the 
loss of a student's potential income may be considered an unreasonable 
hardship, financial difficulties are particularly trying for some of the CSUN 
students, Peterson Walter said. Most of them work, and many take occasional 
semesters off to support their families and save up for school, sometimes never 
to return. 
</P>
<P>
Even for those students who can prove tribal affiliation, who may have some 
access to student grants through the federal Bureau of Indian Affairs, the 
awards tend to be small and usually are contingent on attending school full 
time and finishing within four or five years, Heth said. 
</P>
<P>
Junior Theresa Lucas, part Navajo and part Cherokee, considers herself luckier 
than most Indian students. She is on a leave of absence that she took to have 
her second baby, but she plans to return full time in the spring with the 
stability of her husband's job, a scholarship from the National Institutes of 
Health and a built-in baby-sitter, her mother. 
</P>
<P>
"I can understand why a lot of people don't go back," she said. "If I didn't 
have my husband, I don't know if I'd be able to continue." 
</P>
<P>
CSUN's dropout situation may be no worse than the national picture, but 
administrators are concerned about it. They are developing plans for an 
American Indian studies department, which they hope will help them recruit more 
Indian students and encourage some of the 208 students attending classes there 
now to stay in school by providing them with an academic and social base. 
</P>
<P>
Currently, only a minor is offered in the subject, with classes scattered among 
several disciplines. 
</P>
<P>
The department proposal was endorsed last week by the School of Social and 
Behavioral Sciences, which would house the department. It now will be reviewed 
by the campus administration, which already has expressed interest in the idea. 
</P>
<P>
"We feel that since we now have departments for the three other major minority 
groups, it would be appropriate to establish one for American Indians," said 
Bob Suzuki, vice president of academic affairs. 
</P>
<P>
An Asian-American studies department was founded earlier this year, while 
Pan-African studies and Chicano studies were formed in the early '70s, in the 
wake of community and campus civil rights protests. 
</P>
<P>
American Indian students and other observers believe establishment of a 
department would be a good first step toward acknowledging their presence on 
campus. But they remain skeptical that the university will allocate resources 
necessary to make the program work. In the past, they said, advisers to the 
American Indian studies minor have been under-supported both financially and 
academically. 
</P>
<P>
"The American Indian studies program and the American Indian students have been 
treated like a stepchild. . . . They give them a lot of lip service, but they 
never really treat them right," said Suzanne Ankerstrom, a Chippewa who 
finished her undergraduate degree at CSUN in 1987, 13 years after she started 
there as a freshman. She is pursuing a master's degree there while teaching 
high school. 
</P>
<P>
The American Indian studies minor at CSUN has a checkered past, which critics 
say largely hinged on political whim. At its peak, following student protests 
in the late 1970s and early 1980s, it had an American Indian director, an 
office and an array of course offerings. There were more than 700 Indian 
students on campus then, said Dean Ralph Vicero of the School of Social and 
Behavioral Sciences. The director had close ties to American Indian recruiters 
in the educational equity office. 
</P>
<P>
Now, an assistant dean in the School of Behavioral Sciences is temporarily 
overseeing the program, along with many other duties, Vicero said. Students say 
they have trouble completing the minor because required courses are offered so 
infrequently. For the past few years, there have been no ethnic Indian 
recruiters at the campus, Suzuki said, although one may be hired in the next 
few months.
