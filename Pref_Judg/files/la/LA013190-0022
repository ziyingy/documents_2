None of the temblors registered higher than magnitude 2.9, a spokesman for the 
Caltech seismology lab in Pasadena said. The epicenter was 25 miles north of 
town, near the Salton Sea, the spokesman said. The quakes occurred in the 
Brawley seismic zone, a complex web of faults. Seismologists reported similar 
waves of small quakes have struck the region before.
