I read with great anticipation "All-Out Against Alcohol" (The Times, Sept. 7) 
but was soon disappointed to see that another error was being promulgated. The 
distinction was repeatedly and incorrectly drawn between "drugs and alcohol." 
This reference fosters confusion and denial. Alcohol is a drug, legal but 
nonetheless dangerous. The text could read "alcohol and other drugs" or "drugs, 
including alcohol." Alcohol is a mind-altering chemical, it risks lives and its 
use can lead to addiction. Therefore, alcohol is a drug.
