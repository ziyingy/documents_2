Escondido police, 6 1/2 hours after the 4:30 a.m. attack, detained six people 
for questioning, said Lt. Earl Callender. He said the six had not been 
arrested, and he refused to release their names, but the interrogation 
continued late into Wednesday evening.

The robbers bound the five residents of the house in the 700 block of West El 
Norte Parkway before leaving with the truck, a rifle, a shotgun, jewelry, a 
stereo and several hundred dollars in cash, according to Callender.

The residents freed themselves and called police. Callender identified two of 
the victims as Bill Savell, 25, and Stephanie Bramhall, 20. Two other roommates 
and a house guest were not identified.

According to Callender, at least one of the assailants knew one of the victims.

He said the six people were detained for questioning because one of the victims 
overheard the robbers mentioning a hotel room number.

The six were taken into custody at Best Western Hotel at Del Norte Parkway and 
Interstate 15, Callender said. He refused to say why they were being questioned 
or to provide other details in the case.
