The afternoon sun that warmed Venice Beach on Sunday may have drawn thousands 
of visitors, but it was the cool Midnight Sun that dazzled them once they got 
there. 
</P>
<P>
And in March, this group of five roller-skate dancers will strap on their 
skates, smear rosin on their palms and don their black costumes to perform at 
the 43rd Los Angeles International Folk Dance Festival. 
</P>
<P>
From the rambunctious boardwalks of Venice to the staid stage of the Dorothy 
Chandler Pavilion may seem like quite a leap, particularly considering that the 
group has been together only since September, but the skaters appear confident 
that their sudden recognition is not simply a matter of fairy-tale luck. 
</P>
<P>
"It is very difficult to get a new art form off the ground. But since we have 
come together, we have soared like a rocket, combining all different styles 
into a unique routine," said Kristina Hill, who along with her husband, Chris 
Hill, formed the Midnight Sun. 
</P>
<P>
The routine is a visual salad: lifts, hops and spins covering the entire 
spectrum of dance forms, from the more traditional and fluid jazz, ballet and 
tap to the fast, upbeat and anything-goes moves of funk and disco. 
</P>
<P>
The dancers move mostly in couples, against the fast, staccato rhythm of a rap 
number. They execute daredevil acrobatic spins and twists in the air, and all 
kinds of break-dance moves. 
</P>
<P>
And the crowd eats it up. 
</P>
<P>
"The crowd experiences a strong personal chemistry with the wheels, the acting, 
the expression, the dancing and the music. It is an unrefined art form that's 
growing," says Chris Hill, a ballet dancer and actor who has been dancing on 
wheels for the last 10 years. 
</P>
<P>
The onlookers who surrounded them on the boardwalk on New Year's Eve afternoon 
were an eclectic mixture too: tourists squinting through camcorders, teen-agers 
joining in the dance, and a 5-year-old who came up to a dancer during a short 
break and urged him to "start with your stuff again!" 
</P>
<P>
"It stirs the child in everybody," said Kristina Hill. "It's fun to watch 
because when you dance on skates you can see the music. You roll from one 
movement to the other." 
</P>
<P>
Easy as it may sound, the movements clearly call for the agility and strength 
of a gymnast combined with the grace of a ballet dancer. 
</P>
<P>
"We work very hard; we practice regularly; we watch our routines on tape; we do 
the moves over and over," said Demeryst Upshaw, 24. 
</P>
<P>
All five dancers have extensive backgrounds in music and in "dancing on feet," 
as they call it. 
</P>
<P>
"Apart from jazz dancing, I played the drums, and that's where I get my rhythm 
from," Upshaw said. "I just conformed my drumbeats to my skates -- I put my 
hands to my feet." 
</P>
<P>
Upshaw and another Midnight Sun member, Laura von Bergman, recently returned 
from a skating tour of Japan that included performances in Nagoya and Osaka. 
</P>
<P>
Bergman, an Austrian who came to the United States three years ago, trained as 
a ballet dancer and also has been a competitive windsurfer. 
</P>
<P>
"Everything that has got to do with balance, I pick up very fast," she said. 
"The ballet and the windsurfing help a lot in lifts and spins in the air." 
</P>
<P>
A key break for the Midnight Sun dancers came a few months ago in the form of a 
chance encounter with tap dancer Chester Whitmore. 
</P>
<P>
Whitmore, who choreographed the Grammy Award-winning comedy video, "I'm Fat," 
has toured Europe five times with his group, the Black Ballet Jazz. 
</P>
<P>
He met the Sun at a studio where "I was rehearsing in another room and happened 
to see them dance. They saw my group and wanted me to help them out with the 
technique. 
</P>
<P>
"I was impressed by their moves and told them that it was a good time for them 
to get an act." 
</P>
<P>
Still, Whitmore added, "they had to be seen by the right people." So he 
recommended the group to Irwin Parnes, managing director of the International 
Concerts Exchange, the agency that has been producing the Los Angeles 
International Folk Dance festival for the last four decades. 
</P>
<P>
Parnes, producer and the director of this year's festival, said he, too, was 
immediately impressed with their demonstration videotape. 
</P>
<P>
"To do the dances on roller skates was something unique," he said. "Their 
precision and their performance would be exciting." 
</P>
<P>
And so, even though "the roster was complete," the Midnight Sun was selected to 
perform at the festival, joining dancers from 16 countries, including Poland, 
Hungary and the Philippines. 
</P>
<P>
"We have to make it a spectacular thing because it is a great break," said 
Daniela Aguilar, 23, the fifth member of the team. 
</P>
<P>
The members admit that it is often difficult to balance their part-time jobs 
for sustenance and full-time dedication to roller-skate dancing. Money gets 
tight at times. 
</P>
<P>
There are sponsors, Kristina Hill says, including Reidell, a boot manufacturing 
company that has supplied them with shoes, and Powell Corp., which provides 
wheels and bearings. These help, Hill says, but the group still is trying to 
get the support necessary to obtain a studio where they can rehearse full time. 
</P>
<P>
Nonetheless, the mood of the skaters is buoyant. 
</P>
<P>
"We are taking off, and we are very optimistic," Chris Hill said. "We know that 
we are a very productive unit with fantastic versatility. We have members who 
are skilled in voice, mixing music, acting, choreographing, skating and 
dancing. And with support, we can really promote roller-skating as an art 
form," he said, then broke into a gentle trot followed by a furious spin on his 
skates. 
</P>
<P>
As a 44-year-old tourist from Spain said: "It's terrific. It feels as if they 
don't have feet. Instead, God gave them wheels."
