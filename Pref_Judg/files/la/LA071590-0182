Hand-woven Ecuadorean shawls, multicolored Guatemalan costumes and Huichol 
Indian suits gaily adorn the walls and ceiling of Pasadena's Folk Tree Gallery 
this month as part of a celebration of international textiles. 
</P>
<P>
The decorative items are all handcrafted -- woven, dyed, knotted and 
embroidered -- by natives of Mexico, South and Central America, China, India, 
Africa and Indonesia.

Most are cotton. However, a rare silk huipil, or Guatemalan woman's blouse, is 
included in the display.

The Folk Tree Gallery, founded four years ago by a former public school 
psychologist who has traveled extensively, is a store and gallery with folk art 
exhibits that change monthly.

The objects in this month's exhibit were culled mostly from private 
collections, manager Kathy Oshima said. "Some of it has been in the United 
States for more than 50 years, and other pieces came off the backs of natives 
who just traded their clothing," she said.

The free exhibit runs through the end of this month at 217 S. Fair Oaks Ave., 
Pasadena. Hours are 11 a.m. to 6 p.m. Monday through Wednesday and Saturday; 11 
a.m. to 8 p.m. Thursday, and noon to 5 p.m. Sunday. For more information, call 
(818) 795-8733. KAREN E. KLEIN
