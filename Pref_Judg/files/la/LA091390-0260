A medical examiner testified today that William Reedy's blood-alcohol level was 
well above the legal limit when the pickup truck he is accused of driving 
crashed and former major-league manager Billy Martin was killed.

Onondaga County Medical Examiner Erik Mitchell told a Town of Fenton Court jury 
that Reedy's blood-alcohol level as measured at a hospital immediately after 
the crash was 0.16%. The legal limit in New York for driving while intoxicated 
is 0.10.%
