A newborn baby girl was found abandoned in a residential neighborhood Wednesday 
by a man who spotted the infant lying in a cardboard box in a street gutter. 
</P>
<P>
The child, who had been wrapped in two blue acrylic blankets, is in good 
condition at Samaritan Medical Center-San Clemente, and is being treated there 
for hypothermia. 
</P>
<P>
She is white, has dark hair and dark eyes, is 19 inches long and weighs 5 
pounds, 10 ounces. 
</P>
<P>
Nurses at the hospital named the baby Noel in honor of the holiday season. 
</P>
<P>
"She was cold and she was hungry," said Vicki Sweet, the hospital's director of 
emergency services. "As we warmed her up and gave her fluids, she started to 
fuss a little bit." 
</P>
<P>
The discovery of Noel marks the fourth time this year -- and the third in the 
past two months -- that a newborn has been found abandoned in Orange County. 
</P>
<P>
The baby was found about 8:15 a.m. in the 100 block of Avenida Dolores, an 
older section of the city. A doctor at Samaritan gave Baby Noel the middle name 
Dolores in honor of the street.

The man, whose identity was withheld, told police that he was picking up his 
morning newspaper when he saw the small cardboard box lying in a gutter about 
50 feet from his house, near the sixth green of San Clemente Municipal Golf 
Course. As he approached the box, he heard a baby's cry. And when he looked 
inside, he found the baby, with part of her umbilical cord still attached. The 
man then took the infant inside his house and telephoned police, said San 
Clemente police investigator Bart Massey. 
</P>
<P>
"The scary part is where the baby is found -- in a gutter," said San Clemente 
Fire Department spokesman Jack Stubbs. "This is not a doorstep delivery, which 
some of them are." 
</P>
<P>
When paramedics arrived at the scene, the baby was in stable condition. The 
baby fell asleep in the paramedics' truck on the way to the hospital, Stubbs 
said. 
</P>
<P>
"Her temperature was a little low when she first came in," said hospital nurse 
Carol Harrison. "But now she's warm." The baby spent the afternoon sleeping 
comfortably in an incubator. 
</P>
<P>
"The baby is very, very good, doesn't cry much, eats well," said hospital 
spokeswoman Kathy McInerney. 
</P>
<P>
"Noel Dolores" was the talk of the day at the medical center. The infant 
attracted hospital staffers who gazed at her as she slept among about half a 
dozen other newborns in the maternity ward nursery. 
</P>
<P>
"She's so sweet, she's so beautiful," Sweet said. 
</P>
<P>
The baby will remain in an isolation nursery at the hospital for three days, 
and then be transferred to Orangewood Children's Home for abandoned or 
neglected youngsters. 
</P>
<P>
Police so far have no leads, but a neighbor reported seeing a blue sedan 
driving slowly down the street about 15 minutes before the discovery. Massey, 
however, said that it is common for drivers to go slow in that area.
