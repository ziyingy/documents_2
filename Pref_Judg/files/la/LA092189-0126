<P>
Richard Ramirez, whose murderous crime rampage four years ago terrorized 
Southern California and baffled police for months, was found guilty Wednesday 
of all 43 Night Stalker crimes, including 13 murders. The verdict raises the 
possibility of a death sentence. 
</P>
<P>
Before the verdicts were read, the sullen, 29-year-old defendant asked for, and 
was granted, permission to leave the packed courtroom, which included several 
relatives of his murder victims. He heard the verdicts -- a virtual clean sweep 
for the prosecution -- through a speaker in a holding cell. 
</P>
<P>
The Los Angeles Superior Court jury of seven women and five men, which 
deliberated for 22 days, next must decide whether to condemn the 
devil-worshiping drifter from El Paso to die in the gas chamber at San Quentin 
or order him imprisoned for life without parole. 
</P>
<P>
As he was taken from the courthouse, Ramirez flashed a two-finger "devil sign" 
to photographers. Asked what he thought about the verdicts, he issued a 
one-word comment: "Evil." 
</P>
<P>
Daniel V. Hernandez, Ramirez's chief counsel, said "Richard wasn't surprised" 
by the verdicts. Ramirez, he said, has felt for several weeks now that the jury 
could not be fair or objective in its deliberations. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm disappointed," added Ray G. Clark, Hernandez's co-counsel. "I felt that we 
had raised a reasonable doubt." 
</P>
<P>
After the court adjourned, Los Angeles Deputy Dist. Atty. P. Philip Halpin 
commented: "Thank God this phase is over." 
</P>
<P>
Co-prosecutor Alan S. Yochelson said he would begin immediately calling the 
relatives of Ramirez's victims to inform them of the verdicts. "I hope they can 
find some relief in that," he said. 
</P>
<P>
In the verdicts, Halpin and Yochelson got everything they asked for, except for 
one murder count, in which the jury returned a guilty verdict of second-degree 
rather than first-degree murder. That involved the March 17, 1985, murder of 
Tsai-Lian Victoria Yu, who was shot to death in her car on Alhambra Avenue in 
Monterey Park. 
</P>
<P>
But Halpin and Yochelson called that determination "amazingly sophisticated" 
because, they said, the jurors had been smart enough to determine that the 
murder had occurred without premeditation or deliberation. 
</P>
<P>
"It shows they were paying very close attention to both the evidence and the 
jury instructions," Yochelson said. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Word to Relatives 
</P>
<P>
After court was adjourned, the prosecutors advised the relatives of Ramirez's 
victims who were on hand to refrain from commenting to the news media, since 
the penalty phase still lies ahead. 
</P>
<P>
But two of them, Ellen Francis and Judith Arnold, the daughters of Maxon and 
Lela Kneiding, who lived in Glendale, said they intended to visit their 
parents' grave sites. The women had struggled visibly to choke back tears as 
Judge Michael A. Tynan read the guilty verdicts for the murders of their 
parents. 
</P>
<P>
In all, the jury returned with 19 "special circumstances," such as the 
commission or attempted commission of a burglary in addition to a murder. Each 
such "special circumstance" makes Ramirez subject to the death penalty. 
</P>
<P>
It took court clerk Josephine Williams and Tynan about 45 minutes to read the 
verdicts. 
</P>
<P>
The so-called penalty phase of the trial is to begin Wednesday morning. 
Ramirez's lawyers are expected to start calling witnesses whose testimony is 
intended to persuade jurors to spare Ramirez's life. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Rebuttal Weighed 
</P>
<P>
Halpin said he does not intend to call prosecution witnesses during this phase, 
except perhaps as rebuttal witnesses after the defense case is over. 
</P>
<P>
Most of the Night Stalker crimes were committed during pre-dawn residential 
burglaries throughout Los Angeles County and were marked by cold-blooded 
murders, savage beatings, mutilations and sexual assaults. 
</P>
<P>
The crimes were especially chilling because they seemed so indiscriminate. 
</P>
<P>
The victims were middle-class men and women who lived peacefully in neatly 
tended houses and condominiums and had simply gone to bed with a window or door 
unsecured on a warm, benign California night. 
</P>
<P>
Among Ramirez's victims were a traffic supervisor, an accountant, a lawyer, a 
student, a pizzeria owner, a parking lot attendant, an auto mechanic. Some were 
grandparents. One was a church deacon. 
</P>
<P>
The wave of random and brutal slayings generated widespread fear throughout 
Southern California once police disclosed the existence of a wanton serial 
killer on Aug. 8, 1985. 
</P>
<P>
Sales of guns, ammunition, locks and window bars rose sharply all over the 
county. In the weeks leading up to Aug. 31, the day Ramirez was caught by 
citizens in East Los Angeles, employees of gun shops and home-security stores 
often arrived for work in the morning to find customers waiting at their doors. 
</P>
<P>
Even police officers were spooked by the killings. One senior member of the 
region-wide police Night Stalker task force became so concerned that he moved 
his family out of their San Gabriel Valley house during the manhunt. 
</P>
<P>
Various government agencies eventually offered about $80,000 in reward money 
for information leading to the killer's arrest and conviction. Nearly 20 claims 
already have been filed and now can be processed. 
</P>
<P>
All but one attack occurred between mid-March and early August of 1985. Several 
of them took place within hours and blocks of one another. 
</P>
<P>
Initially, many weeks passed before investigators realized that the lack of a 
pattern was one of Ramirez's trademarks. His modus operandi did not fit neatly 
into the traditional categories that police had come to associate with serial 
criminals. 
</P>
<P>
Even as the killings continued, however, investigators gradually began to 
recognize the Night Stalker's various "signatures" -- distinctive and gaping 
stab and slash wounds to the throat or body; the familiar language that Ramirez 
used in demanding loot; his use of ligatures and restraints, including 
handcuffs and thumb cuffs; and unusual Avia shoe prints at many of the crime 
scenes, including a bloody print on a murder victim's face. 
</P>
<P>
Ramirez often severed the telephone wires after gaining entry. 
</P>
<P>
In nearly all the attacks, he quickly dispatched any adult males with a gunshot 
to the head. Then he ransacked the homes and assaulted the women, sometimes in 
the same room where their husbands lay dead. A Northridge man who survived a 
gunshot still carries Ramirez's bullet in his head. 
</P>
<P>
Another Ramirez trademark was the pentagram, which first appeared in the remote 
Monrovia home of Mabel Bell and Florence Lang, drawn on a bedroom wall and on 
the thigh of one of the women. In a Sun Valley attack, he repeatedly ordered a 
woman to "swear upon Satan" as he looted her home and raped and sodomized her 
after killing her husband. 
</P>
<P>
The pentagrams -- inverted, five-pointed stars inside circles, associated with 
devil worship -- also were found later on the dashboard of a car driven by 
Ramirez and on his arm. In jail, he drew a pentagram on the cell floor, 
apparently in his own blood. Ramirez also flashed a pentagram drawn on his palm 
once in open court, yelling, "Hail Satan!" 
</P>
<P>
The Avia tennis shoes were never found. But prosecutors linked the shoe prints 
to Ramirez by introducing evidence from a Monrovia burglary on May 9, 1985, in 
which police identified not only the shoe prints but also a Ramirez palm print 
-- on the kitchen counter beneath an open window. Ramirez was not charged in 
that incident. 
</P>
<P>
In all, four handguns were used in the Night Stalker crimes, but only one was 
recovered. However, firearms tests showed that several unused bullets in a bag 
that Ramirez had left at the downtown Greyhound bus depot once had been loaded 
into the gun that was used in Night Stalker attacks in Northridge and Diamond 
Bar. 
</P>
<P>
Eventually, about 375 pieces of jewelry and other personal property taken from 
eight of the crime scenes were recovered and linked to Ramirez. 
</P>
<P>
In addition to the burglaries and murders, Ramirez also is suspected of 
kidnaping and sexually assaulting as many as a dozen children, some as young as 
6, although he was never charged with those crimes, according to Sgt. Frank 
Salerno, the Los Angeles County sheriff's homicide detective who directed the 
Night Stalker task force. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
14th Victim? 
</P>
<P>
Officials also believe that Ramirez murdered a 14th person in Los Angeles 
County: Patti Higgins, a 32-year-old special education teacher who was found in 
her Arcadia apartment on June 27, 1985, with her throat slashed. That charge 
was dropped before trial because of lack of evidence. 
</P>
<P>
As for the 43 felony counts on which Ramirez was tried, the outcome never 
seemed in much doubt, given the wealth of direct and circumstantial evidence 
against Ramirez, which also included self-incriminating statements he made 
after arrest. 
</P>
<P>
In all, eight eyewitnesses -- including six surviving women -- either 
identified Ramirez as their assailant or placed him at a crime scene. 
</P>
<P>
Jury selection began on July 21, 1988, nearly three years after Ramirez's 
arrest. The case went to the jury last July 26, after more than 165 witnesses 
had testified and 658 exhibits were introduced. 
</P>
<P>
The trial was full of twists and turns and tragedy of its own. 
</P>
<P>
On Aug. 14, after 12 1/2 days of deliberations, one of the jurors, Phyllis Y. 
Singletary, was found murdered in her Carson apartment, the victim of a 
domestic quarrel with her boyfriend, James C. Melton. Melton committed suicide 
the next day. 
</P>
<P>
Singletary's murder traumatized many of the remaining jurors and eight 
alternates, raising questions as to whether they would be emotionally capable 
of carrying on. 
</P>
<P>
But Judge Tynan gave jurors a day off and ordered deliberations to begin anew 
after a disconsolate alternate was named to take Singletary's place. 
</P>
<P>
That was the second false start in jury deliberations. 
</P>
<P>
Earlier, one of the jurors fell asleep twice during the second week of 
deliberations, prompting Tynan on Aug. 11 to dismiss him and replace him with 
another alternate. It was the following Monday morning that Singletary was 
slain. 
</P>
<P>
Daniel and Arturo Hernandez, Ramirez's initial defense lawyers, frustrated 
Judge Tynan and prosecutor Halpin with maneuvers that repeatedly delayed the 
proceedings. Halfway through the trial, Tynan appointed the third lawyer, 
Clark, to assist the team. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Wanted No Defense 
</P>
<P>
The 14-month trial would have ended much sooner had Ramirez's lawyers taken 
their client's advice. 
</P>
<P>
After the prosecution rested its case, Ramirez did not want to mount a defense. 
But his lawyers prevailed, ultimately calling 38 witnesses on Ramirez's behalf 
over the course of about five weeks in an attempt to imbue jurors with a 
reasonable doubt. 
</P>
<P>
Throughout the years of court proceedings in the case, Ramirez's courtroom 
behavior often has been unpredictable. He once called a witness a liar. Another 
time he called the judge several expletives. On another occasion, he used an 
object to reflect ceiling light into the face of a witness. 
</P>
<P>
Yet, at other times, the shaggy-haired defendant, with his ever-present black 
sunglasses, has studiously followed the testimony, taking notes and conferring 
with members of his defense team. His feet remained shackled throughout. 
</P>
<P>
Ramirez was examined in 1985 by a court-appointed psychologist, who found him 
to be "borderline competent" after a 10- to 15-minute discussion that was 
abruptly terminated by Ramirez. "I am sane," Ramirez said at one pretrial 
hearing in 1985. 
</P>
<P>
During the trial, prosecutors presented the 43 felony charges to jurors as 15 
separate "incidents," mostly in chronological order, buttressed by charts and 
maps as well as gruesome color photographs of the crime scenes and victims. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Faces More Charges 
</P>
<P>
Ramirez still faces separate felony charges, including murder and attempted 
murder, in Orange County and in San Francisco. 
</P>
<P>
His identity became known after authorities lifted a partial fingerprint from a 
stolen car that was linked to Ramirez's final attack, in Mission Viejo on Aug. 
25, 1985. 
</P>
<P>
Working manually -- and not with a laser and a state-of-the-art computer as 
previously reported -- experts matched that print with those taken of Ramirez 
after his arrest in Los Angeles several years earlier on a misdemeanor traffic 
violation. 
</P>
<P>
Once Ramirez's identity became known, police issued an all-points bulletin for 
his arrest, accompanied by a mug shot. The next morning, Aug. 31, 1985, he was 
captured in East Los Angeles shortly after he had returned to Los Angeles from 
Arizona, where he was visiting a brother. 
</P>
<P>
At the end, Ramirez nearly eluded the authorities. 
</P>
<P>
On the morning of his arrest, about half a dozen Los Angeles undercover police 
officers -- armed with Ramirez's photograph -- had staked out the downtown 
Greyhound bus depot, expecting the suspect to board a bus out of town. 
</P>
<P>
But Ramirez managed to slip through the depot undetected, apparently because 
the officers had been focusing on departing passengers rather than those 
arriving in Los Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
After Ramirez was arrested and fingerprinted, Los Angeles police also linked 
him to the murder of a 79-year-old Glassell Park woman in June of 1984 by 
identifying two of his fingerprints -- previously unidentified -- on a window 
screen that had been removed to gain entry to the woman's ground-floor 
apartment. 
</P>
<P>
Ramirez was allowed to leave the courtroom before the verdicts were read 
despite prosecution objections. Tynan excused Ramirez, saying he feared that 
the defendant would disrupt the proceedings.

KEY PLAYERS IN STALKER TRIAL 
</P>
<P>
MICHAEL A. TYNAN, 52 -- Superior Court judge since 1984. Somewhat impatient by 
nature, he has managed the case with forebearance and humor, several times 
making rulings that have avoided mistrials. 
</P>
<P>
P. PHILIP HALPIN, 52 -- The no-nonsense, career prosecutor has clashed 
repeatedly with opposing counsel while working overtime to correct or avoid 
defense mistakes in hopes of avoiding appellate reversal. 
</P>
<P>
ALAN S. YOCHELSON, 34 -- He joined district attorney's office eight years ago. 
Was ecstatic when assigned as the Night Stalker co-prosecutor. Friendly, 
easy-going. He handled blood and scientific evidence skillfully. 
</P>
<P>
DANIEL V. HERNANDEZ, 44 -- A late-comer to the legal profession, enrolling in 
law school at age 33. Has struggled mightily through his first death-penalty 
case. Often chided by Tynan for shortcomings. 
</P>
<P>
RAY G. CLARK, 58 -- A folksy, plain-speaking lawyer. Appointed by Tynan in 
mid-trial to assist Hernandez. A quick study, but he never seemed to fully 
grasp the enormous amount of details and evidence in the case. 
</P>
<P>
FRANK SALERNO, 50 -- Sheriff's Department homicide detective. Avid outdoorsman. 
Led the Night Stalker task force. Has attended trial religiously. One Night 
Stalker incident occurred near his home. 
</P>
