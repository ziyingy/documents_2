A Ventura County woman had a blood-alcohol content more than twice the level of 
legal drunkenness when she was arrested on suspicion of drunk driving last 
week, authorities said, the night before she was arrested again after an 
accident that killed three young men and injured two others.

Diane Helen Mannes, 34, of Somis had blood-alcohol readings of 0.25% and 0.26% 
in two Breathalyzer tests shortly after she was arrested at 1:10 a.m. Thursday, 
California Highway Patrol Officer Rick Carter said. A blood-alcohol level of 
0.10% is considered legally drunk.

Mannes was taken to the Van Nuys Division jail at 2 a.m. and released on her 
own recognizance eight hours later, a Los Angeles police spokesman said.

Friday night, Mannes was arrested on suspicion of drunk driving after a fatal 
accident on the westbound Ventura Freeway east of Camarillo.

Mannes' blood-alcohol reading after the accident will not be available for 
another week, CHP Officer Lisa Sowell said. The tests are being conducted on 
her blood.

Mannes was released Monday afternoon from Los Robles Regional Medical Center in 
Thousand Oaks, where she was treated for minor injuries, a nursing supervisor 
said.

Ventura County Deputy Dist. Atty. Gregory D. Totten said Mannes is not in 
custody but is in a "lock and key" situation at a hospital that was identified 
by Sowell as Simi Valley Adventist Hospital in Simi Valley.
