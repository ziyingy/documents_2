The neighbors of Charles Collins, a 16-year-old who helped extinguish a rooftop 
fire during December's high winds, plan to present him a plaque in honor of his 
courage.

About 2:30 p.m. Dec. 7, Collins noticed that the wind had caused some power 
lines to snap, setting trees on fire and causing a fire on the roof of Roger 
and Becky Tschirgi's home. The Tschirgis were not home at the time.

Collins, along with neighbor William Capp, watered down hot spots on the roof 
for about half an hour. County fire crews arrived about 10 minutes later. 
Although the roof had to be replaced, the house escaped major damage. No date 
has been set for the ceremony honoring Collins.
