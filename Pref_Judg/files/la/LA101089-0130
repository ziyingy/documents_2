"The paper was undercapitalized, and they ran out of money," Jose Mariano 
Castillo said of El Diario de Los Angeles, which halted publication after 
Saturday's edition.

Castillo said El Diario's owner, Inmobiliaria America Latina Inc., hope to 
revive the newspaper, which was launched in May, 1987. "There is a hope that 
maybe in the future it will reappear," he said. "It's just a question of 
money."

He said the newspaper had been losing approximately $80,000 a month. He said 24 
people lost their jobs when the newspaper ceased publication Saturday. Another 
26 had been laid off in June.
