The art of taxidermy is a technique for preserving and showing animals as they 
appeared when they were alive. It requires a knowledge of anatomy, sculpture, 
tanning, dyeing, painting and natural history. 
</P>
<P>
Orange County at one time had enough professional taxidermists to require 
counting with both hands. Today there are just three. 
</P>
<P>
There appears to be a trend in bereaved pet owners who are turning to 
taxidermists in order to keep their beloved animals with them forever. Most 
taxidermists refuse to work on pets because, they say, the owners are never 
really satisfied. Taxidermists say they can make animals look like they're 
alive, but they can't put personalities in their faces. 
</P>
<P>
Two of the three are willing to handle pets. Some of those they have worked on 
include iguanas, hamsters, dogs, cats and snakes. 
</P>
<P>
And yes, it's against the law to stuff a human being (though the request is 
still made). The prices listed below include mounting.
