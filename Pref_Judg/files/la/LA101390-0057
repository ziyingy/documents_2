At the Antelope Valley Courthouse in Lancaster, where a staggering workload has 
forced the creation of makeshift courtrooms and prevented hundreds of civil 
cases from going to trial, officials are welcoming the appointment of a second 
Superior Court judge. 
</P>
<P>
Judge Charles E. Horan, a former Glendale Municipal Court judge and Los Angeles 
County prosecutor, said Friday that he expects to start work in Lancaster in 
about 10 days, after completing a murder trial in downtown Los Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
Presiding Superior Court Judge Richard P. Byrne said he chose Horan to join 
Judge Margaret M. Grignon in Lancaster Superior Court because of an enormous 
rise in criminal and civil cases that has accompanied the area's population 
growth. In addition to Grignon, two Superior Court commissioners hear juvenile 
and family matters. Horan's arrival will bring the number of judicial officers 
to four. 
</P>
<P>
"There has been a demonstrated need for a long period of time," Byrne said in a 
telephone interview Friday. "The percentage of growth in the Antelope Valley 
has been greater than in other parts of the county." 
</P>
<P>
The number of criminal cases filed in Lancaster Superior Court has tripled 
since 1986 and the number of criminals sent to prison from the court has 
increased fourfold during the same period, according to county statistics. The 
number of civil cases has increased 103% since 1985, with 1,400 civil filings 
projected by the end of the year, Grignon said Friday. 
</P>
<P>
Grignon, supervising Deputy Dist. Atty. Stephen L. Cooley and other Lancaster 
officials have been lobbying for additional judges, citing studies that show 
the caseload calls for at least six judicial officers. 
</P>
<P>
"We've been talking about this for two years," Cooley said. "It's welcome and 
it's long overdue." 
</P>
<P>
Byrne said judicial vacancies and a countywide shortage of judgeships delayed 
the appointment. 
</P>
<P>
To keep up with the workload, Grignon has been taking work home and diverting 
some criminal cases to the San Fernando courts. She also has postponed hearing 
civil cases; there has not been a civil trial in Lancaster this year, and last 
year there were only two, Grignon said. 
</P>
<P>
Horan will take over the bulk of criminal cases when he arrives, Grignon said, 
with a juvenile commissioner handling the overflow. Meanwhile, Grignon said she 
will concentrate on civil matters. 
</P>
<P>
At the end of the year, Grignon will leave the Antelope Valley to fill an 
appellate court position to which she was appointed recently. She and other 
officials will meet with County Supervisor Mike Antonovich, seeking a 
commitment that the new judgeship will be retained. 
</P>
<P>
Byrne said the decision will be left to the new presiding judge, Ricardo A. 
Torres, who will take over in January. 
</P>
<P>
Horan, 39, comes to Lancaster after three years on the Municipal Court bench. 
Before his appointment in 1987, he was a deputy district attorney in the major 
narcotics and forfeiture section of the Los Angeles County district attorney's 
office. 
</P>
<P>
Horan has also gained a name as a part-time rock musician. He plays lead guitar 
in a band named Use a Guitar, Go to Prison.
