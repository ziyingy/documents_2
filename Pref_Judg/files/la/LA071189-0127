Residual oil inside the hull of the crippled tanker Exxon Valdez, washed loose 
by seawater, was the likely source of a 10-mile oil sheen off the coast of San

Concern about the offshore oil slick and the discovery of five flaps of steel 
hanging from the bottom of the tanker will delay the disabled tanker's entry 
into San Diego Bay at least several days.
