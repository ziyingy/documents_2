Felipe Gomez, a native of Mexico who has lived in Fullerton and worked for the 
same nursery 11 years, became a legal resident of this country last year. His 
three children were born here, so they are U.S. citizens. 
</P>
<P>
But Felipe's wife did not qualify for amnesty. So she has placed her name on 
the long list of foreigners seeking legal residency in this country. Because 
the number of applicants for visas far outpaces the legal ceiling imposed by 
Congress, Rosalva Gomez had faced a 10-year wait for that piece of paper saying 
she can stay here permanently. 
</P>
<P>
But the most comprehensive reform of U.S. immigration laws in 25 years, passed 
by Congress Saturday night by a vote of 264 to 118, could dramatically reduce 
the long wait for Rosalva Gomez and thousands of others like her waiting to 
become legal residents or citizens. 
</P>
<P>
The landmark measure would expand the number of people allowed to enter the 
United States by an estimated 40% and change the mix of skills and ethnic 
backgrounds. 
</P>
<P>
When the law goes into effect in 1992, it will more than double the number of 
immigrants allowed entry because of their job skills, grant temporary "safe 
haven" to Salvadoran refugees and open the borders to tens of thousands of 
immigrants from Ireland and other nations who have been largely excluded under 
current laws. 
</P>
<P>
It also wipes from the statute books decades-old restrictions barring entry to 
people on the basis of their beliefs or homosexuality. President Bush has 
indicated he will sign the bill. 
</P>
<P>
For California, which has about 54% of the nation's immigrants in the amnesty 
program, it would mean the legalization of many people who are already here 
illegally, and it could mean a chance for employers who have trouble attracting 
workers to import more people from overseas. 
</P>
<P>
"This is a very smart bill," said Maria Hsiu, a co-chair of the Pacific 
Leadership Council, a Los Angeles-based national lobbying group of Asian 
business leaders and professionals. "Everybody is very happy." 
</P>
<P>
For two years, she said, a number of groups representing immigrants and 
business leaders have been in Washington buttonholing congressional 
representatives to hammer out a compromise on the complex issue. 
</P>
<P>
"We worked real, real hard," Hsiu said. "We went back to Washington once a 
month and walked from office to office to lobby this bill." 
</P>
<P>
About 500 members of Hermandad Mexicana Nacional, a Latino civil rights group, 
traveled from California, Illinois, Texas and New York to Washington this 
summer, said Nativo Lopez, executive director of the Orange County chapter. 
</P>
<P>
"We've watched this very carefully for two years," she said. "And we're now 
watching very closely the negotiations in the conference committee." 
</P>
<P>
The new law would remove prohibitions on some immigrants and would open the 
nation to many new immigrants who are skilled workers and managers. It would 
permit a total of 700,000 immigrants annually in 1992, 1993 and 1994, up from 
the current 500,000, and 675,000 a year thereafter. 
</P>
<P>
While it is difficult to quantify what that would mean for Orange County, which 
had the second highest number of amnesty applicants in California after Los 
Angeles, immigrant rights experts and lawyers who specialize in the field say 
the changes would be significant. 
</P>
<P>
The new mix of immigrants allowed to enter the country would include more 
skilled workers such as scientists and engineers, who are expected to be in 
short supply in the next decade. 
</P>
<P>
Jim David Acoba, an immigration lawyer in Buena Park, said that Orange County, 
with its ever-expanding economy, would gain because employers would face a more 
streamlined process for importing much-needed technical workers such as those 
in the medical field, computer engineering and aircraft industries. 
</P>
<P>
He also said that as more companies that do business abroad locate here, there 
is a need for foreign professionals, such as lawyers, who could help the parent 
company understand the ways of doing business in a country with different laws 
and culture. 
</P>
<P>
"There are a lot of businesses here that are extremely concerned about what is 
going to happen because, frankly, there are a lot of skills that we need here 
that we don't have workers for," said Acoba, who is also chairman of the 
immigration section of the Orange County Bar Assn. 
</P>
<P>
Of the 700,000 people allowed to enter in the first year, 465,000 would be 
relatives of American citizens and permanent resident aliens; 140,000 would be 
skilled workers or their close family members -- up 80,000 from the current 
levels; 40,000 would be residents of nations that have been allowed relatively 
few immigrants in recent years; and 55,000 would be spouses and children of 
aliens who gained legal status under the last major immigration reform law -- 
the amnesty bill -- in 1986. 
</P>
<P>
The bill provides more generous quotas for immigrants from most countries, but 
it especially would open the nation's doors wider to Europeans, some Africans 
and other foreigners. 
</P>
<P>
The proposed change in the law would benefit a Filipino-born client of Acoba, 
who married her childhood sweetheart just before she became a U.S. citizen. She 
and her husband, who did not yet have his U.S. citizenship, adopted a daughter 
in the Philippines. But because the daughter had not lived with the mother the 
two years required by current immigration law for adopted children and the 
father's citizenship was also pending, they could not bring the daughter to 
Orange County. 
</P>
<P>
Her application for a visa was placed on a waiting list that is seven years 
long, Acoba said. 
</P>
<P>
"If we now classify her as the child of a U.S. citizen under the proposed law, 
they should be able to apply and bring her over within about three months," he 
said. "The effect is drastic." 
</P>
<P>
The new law would also benefit Claro and Tayde Rojas of Santa Ana, natives of 
Mexico. The husband came to Orange County in 1980 and works at a company that 
builds irrigation systems. His wife and two children joined him four years 
later. 
</P>
<P>
He has obtained legal residency through the amnesty program, and two of their 
children born here since they arrived are also U.S. citizens. But Tayde Rojas 
and the other two children are not. 
</P>
<P>
If the new law passes, they too would be able to gain legal residency in a 
matter of months, something that would enable her to travel back and forth to 
Mexico to visit her parents, who have never met her two youngest children, she 
said. 
</P>
<P>
Claro Rojas, newly legalized himself, was among the group of delegates from the 
Orange County chapter of Hermandad Mexicana Nacional who traveled to Washington 
to lobby for the bill. 
</P>
<P>
"We went from building to building to speak with senators and congressmen," he 
said. "I thought it was very beautiful. We went to work for all the Latinos. I 
am very happy. 
</P>
<P>
"I would say to myself, 'Well, we are Mexican so they won't want to listen to 
us,' but they did. We would go once, and if they could not see us, we would ask 
what time we should come back. We would wake up at 5 in the morning to prepare 
for the meetings. Nativo told us, 'Tomorrow when you see on television that 
they passed this bill, it will be because of you."' 
</P>
<P>
Lawyer Kathryn E. Terry, a board member of the Orange County Coalition for 
Immigrant Rights, said she is pleased that this proposal would clear the way 
for more employer-sanctioned immigration -- something she said the 1986 amnesty 
bill discouraged. But the part of the proposed new law she likes the best, she 
said, is that it emphasizes unity of citizens and legal residents with their 
immediate family members. 
</P>
<P>
"The reality is that in Orange County we still have a tremendous influx of 
illegal aliens, and not just Mexicans -- that's a misnomer," she said. 
</P>
<P>
"This kind of law deals more with the reality that they are already here, so 
let's let them into our system and let them and us benefit from it," she said. 
"This kind of immigration policy also announces to the world what our national 
values and goals are, that we have a commitment to family unity and a 
commitment to pluralism."
