<P>
Marjorie Grisak wonders if a job she took to help the environment was slowly 
poisoning her. 
</P>
<P>
She sold gopher and squirrel poison for the county, and thinks that over a 
year, she sniffed so much of the stuff that her body rebelled in ways that 
might play in a Stephen King novel. 
</P>
<P>
She had excruciating headaches. She was nauseated. She had trouble staying 
awake at her desk. Others said they saw her drooling. 
</P>
<P>
She's on the mend now, but "I'm still undergoing psychological therapy," she 
said of her slow recovery. "I wanted to work for an agency that was helping the 
environment, and they were poisoning the environment themselves." 
</P>
<P>
Grisak contends that while working as a secretary for the Ramona-Julian 
Resource Conservation District, she was exposed to poisonous phosphine gas 
emitted by the poison she was selling on behalf of the county Department of 
Agriculture. At least three doctors agree. 
</P>
<P>
And at least two other persons working in the adjoining county Department of 
Social Services office in Ramona complained that they, too, were made ill by 
exposure to phosphine gas. 
</P>
<P>
Those workers were granted sick days to recuperate from their maladies, but 
Grisak filed a personal injury lawsuit against the county and filed for 
disability payments with the state's Workers Compensation Appeals Board. 
</P>
<P>
County officials publicly insist there is no substance to Grisak's complaint, 
and are fighting her in court. Her former employer, the conservation district, 
opposes her disability request. 
</P>
<P>
But county memorandums and other internal reports obtained by The Times show 
some county officials harshly criticizing the Department of Agriculture for 
storing the pesticide improperly and for failing to train Grisak in how to 
handle it. 
</P>
<P>
County employees who bag the poison wear protective clothing, according to 
county officials. But Grisak, who sometimes handled spilled bait directly, was 
given no protective clothing, no training and, she said, no warnings. 
</P>
<P>
Grisak did not even work for the county, whose poison she was selling. The 
conservation district is a small state-funded agency whose main purpose is to 
offer advice on plantings and soil for farmers and homeowners. But because the 
district used space in the county branch office, it agreed to have its 
secretary sell the Department of Agriculture's bait. 
</P>
<P>
The pesticide -- packaged, distributed and sold by the county -- is grain bait 
tainted with zinc phosphide. When triggered by moisture -- typically after it 
is ingested by rodents -- the bait emits enough phosphine gas to kill small 
animals. The pesticide was sold by Grisak in 5-pound paper bags, over the 
counter in her Ramona office, for $1.89 a pound. 
</P>
<P>
While proximity to packaged, dry zinc phosphide is not in and of itself 
dangerous, inhalation of the dust, or of the phosphine gas after the poison is 
touched with water, can lead to varying degrees of headache, fatigue, nausea, 
vomiting, coughing, diarrhea and shortness of breath, according to authorities 
and technical papers. Too much exposure can be fatal. 
</P>
<P>
In a Social Services Department investigation of what had happened to its own 
sickened employees, the resulting report complained that "the Dept. of 
Agriculture improperly stored, for several months, a toxic pesticide. The 
matter was stored in an unvented closet with cement flooring. The secretary 
(Grisak) was not trained or authorized in the handling of this material. The 
cement floor, when even moderately moist, will cause the pesticide to exude 
toxic fumes into the environment." 
</P>
<P>
Where the form asks what contributed to the problem, the report says, "The 
apparent or alleged disregard of Dept. of Agriculture personnel in seeing to it 
that this pesticide was more appropriately stored with properly trained 
personnel. 
</P>
<P>
"Our employees were not aware of this potentially dangerous situation until so 
informed by (Grisak)," the report continued. "At this point . . . (Cal/OSHA) is 
involved. Their representatives informed our workers of the potential danger 
and special care required in handling these materials." 
</P>
<P>
Such precautions generally include keeping the chemicals dry and avoiding 
inhaling any fumes or handling the bait with bare hands. 
</P>
<P>
In another interoffice memo within the Department of Social Services, it was 
noted that Grisak "was observed to occasionally be drooling and suffering from 
headaches." 
</P>
<P>
At least two employees in the Social Services Department got time off for their 
illnesses. One of them, Naomi Dummitt -- who no longer works for the county -- 
was diagnosed by her doctor with "exposure to phosphine." 
</P>
<P>
But Grisak's case was by far the worst. Three doctors examined her and 
concurred she showed signs of exposure to zinc phosphide, including "severe, 
incapacitating headaches," lethargy, fatigue, nausea and depression, according 
to files on record at the Workers Compensation Appeals Board. 
</P>
<P>
Dr. James G. Dahlgren, an assistant clinical professor of medicine at UCLA, and 
an internal specialist who examined Grisak, said she also might have sustained 
damage to her peripheral and central nervous system. 
</P>
<P>
Today, Grisak, 39, believes she is on the mend -- but worries about chromosomal 
damage, which is addressed in technical literature as a possible result of 
exposure to phosphine. She and her husband, Mike, had been thinking about 
having children, and now they're in doubt, she said. 
</P>
<P>
She wants disability income, and she wants the county to own up to what she 
said it did to her. 
</P>
<P>
"It would have made life so much simpler if the county would have just said, 
'Gee, we made a mistake.' But they won't." 
</P>
<P>
For their part, county officials dismiss Grisak's allegations. 
</P>
<P>
The county employees who bag the poison wear protective clothing, said Bill 
Snodgrass, the assistant county agricultural commissioner, in defending how 
carefully the county handles the poison. 
</P>
<P>
"The health department reviewed our procedures in handling it, and they did air 
samples in the Ramona office, and they haven't found any problem with the air 
in there," Snodgrass said. 
</P>
<P>
The county no longer distributes the poison through its branch offices, 
Snodgrass said. The practice was eliminated about a year ago -- not, Snodgrass 
said, because of the Grisak incident but because requests for it were dwindling 
and because the poison is available "through private vendors." 
</P>
<P>
In its formal response to Grisak's lawsuit, the county counsel's office said 
any risk she might have faced was "insignificant." The county's defense added 
that Grisak "herself acted unreasonably, carelessly and negligently (because 
she) did not exercise ordinary care, caution or prudence for her own safety or 
protection." 
</P>
<P>
Still, various county workers, in their reports to supervisors, acknowledged 
the problem. 
</P>
<P>
Neil Connelly, a pesticide enforcement officer for the county, wrote that the 
county's "General Services (Department) had some concern about materials on 
floor (due to leaky nature of the building) and hazards resulting from the 
smell of zinc phosphide." 
</P>
<P>
And a supervisor in the Department of Social Services' child protective 
services office wrote in a memo clarifying the request by her two employees for 
worker's compensation: 
</P>
<P>
"At this time I verified that both workers had indeed been exposed to phosphine 
gas. The gas was a byproduct of inappropriate handling/storage by the county 
Department of Agriculture," wrote Betsy Terrazas, the supervisor whose two 
employees work in the same office as Grisak. 
</P>
<P>
Grisak was hired as the sole staff person for the Ramona-Julian Resource 
Conservation District in February, 1988. (The agency has since merged with its 
sister Palomar Resource Conservation District, based in Escondido.) 
</P>
<P>
The zinc phosphide poison began arriving at her office in May or June of 1988 
-- after the county, following an Environmental Protection Agency ruling, 
stopped providing strychnine as rodent poison. 
</P>
<P>
Over the next year or so, according to office records, Grisak handled more than 
400 pounds of the poison, which often was delivered in 50-pound bags holding 
individual 5-pound bags. Saying she had no advice from the county on how to 
handle the material, she put the poison on the cement floor and on the shelves 
inside the small closet -- which was just 10 feet or so from her desk. 
</P>
<P>
Immediately, she said, she noticed a distinctive odor, which later was linked 
to the poison, and is described as similar to either dead fish or garlic. 
</P>
<P>
"I was getting headaches, lethargic, sick," she said. "Others in the office 
were noticing it, too. I was handing out Nuprin like it was candy because of 
all the headaches we were getting, and we'd make extra-strong coffee to try to 
stay awake. I'd find myself going into a stupor." 
</P>
<P>
Dummitt, one of the two employees mentioned in Terrazas' memo, but who has 
since moved to Oregon, remembered the smell too. 
</P>
<P>
"I worked under the same roof, but down the hallway," she said. "It was stinky. 
You'd always notice the odor when you got to work in the morning, but then 
you'd get use to it. In fact, what I most remember were the few days when I 
didn't smell it." 
</P>
<P>
But, Dummitt said, she didn't figure the odor suggested something dangerous. 
</P>
<P>
"We assumed the county wouldn't put something in there that was physically 
dangerous," she said, "because the county is always so conscious about 
protecting itself." 
</P>
<P>
Dummitt said she remembered Grisak bringing the poison in from the back service 
door on a large cart, and how some bags were broken as they were unloaded in 
Ramona. "I'd see her sweeping the loose poison up into a dust pan," she said. 
</P>
<P>
And Grisak herself said she would sometimes simply use her hands to pick up 
fallen poison bait, pour it back into a broken bag and tape it shut. Nobody had 
warned her not to, she said. 
</P>
<P>
Nor was she told to keep it dry, Grisak said. 
</P>
<P>
Yet, her office typically was filled with plants and small trees donated by 
local nurseries for distribution as anti-erosion controls, and nightly she 
would water them. It wasn't unusual, she said, for the water to drip through 
the containers and wet the floor -- in and around the closet -- before she got 
a chance to mop it up. 
</P>
<P>
The building also had a leaky roof, people familiar with the structure said. 
</P>
<P>
On the same day in May of 1989 -- after almost a year of handling the stuff -- 
two people complained about the smell, she said. One was a passer-by who walked 
into the office to look for someone. 
</P>
<P>
"As soon as I walked into the front door of the building, I was overwhelmed by 
a chemical-kind of fume. It smelled like something you didn't want to be around 
or work in," the passer-by, Lawrence Peabody, told The Times recently. 
</P>
<P>
That day, Grisak said, a county maintenance worker, now deceased, noticed the 
smell too. 
</P>
<P>
"He said, 'What do you got in there?' When I opened the door to the closet, he 
said, 'You can't store that in there!' He said the county was breaking every 
regulation on the books." 
</P>
<P>
Within days, a county pesticide inspector was called to the office, put pallets 
on the floor to elevate the poison, and installed a small ventilation fan. 
</P>
<P>
Still, Grisak's nausea and headaches didn't diminish, and in early June she saw 
a doctor. He started her on a series of referrals that ultimately put her with 
Dahlgren, in Los Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
At the same time, she wrote a letter to her bosses -- the board of directors of 
the conservation district -- alerting them that she would not be able to return 
to work for a month. In fact, she decided to quit altogether. 
</P>
<P>
And she complained to the state Occupational Safety and Health Administration, 
or Cal/OSHA, fearing that her workplace was contaminated. 
</P>
<P>
Grisak said the Cal/OSHA inspector was astounded by what he saw, but that he 
could do nothing about it. That inspector could not be reached by The Times. 
Both times he was called, his supervisor -- regional Cal/OSHA manager Don Amos 
-- returned the call. 
</P>
<P>
His office didn't pursue the Ramona complaint, Amos said, because of an 
agreement with the county for its own Department of Agriculture to investigate 
complaints involving the use of pesticide -- even if those complaints focus on 
the Department of Agriculture itself. 
</P>
<P>
The state Department of Agriculture sent a pesticide enforcement officer to 
Ramona, but according to a spokesman for that agency, nothing amiss was found. 
</P>
<P>
While the agency was miffed that it was called in to investigate "because we 
don't regulate storage or if workers are accidentally exposed to it," an 
investigation was nonetheless conducted, said Veda Federighi. 
</P>
<P>
"We could find no apparent exposure to zinc, and no evidence that phosphide had 
leaked out of the bags," she said. 
</P>
<P>
Grisak and Dummitt said they were not surprised because, they contend, the 
poisons were removed -- and the closet walls and floor washed down -- by a 
county worker before the inspection. There simply was nothing left to detect. 
</P>
<P>
The problem was a major focus of conversation among the county employees in 
Ramona, according to one worker at the time. "One of our supervisors told us to 
keep this quiet, to keep our dirty laundry to ourselves," the worker said. 
</P>
<P>
Even the directors of the resource conservation district seemed to turn against 
her, Grisak said. "They turned into a company of strangers," she said of the 
volunteer board. "And when they heard that Cal/OSHA had lost jurisdiction on 
the case because of the agreement with the county, they looked like the cat 
that ate the canary." 
</P>
<P>
Raymond Foster, president of the board, did not return phone calls put to his 
office for this story. 
</P>
<P>
For several weeks in June and July of 1989, the office was closed for the 
investigation. The closure was a "safety precaution," a spokeswoman for the 
Department of Social Services told the Ramona Sentinel newspaper at the time. 
"Some of the workers came down with headaches, but they may have been because 
the building had been sprayed for ants or it might have been psychological 
because someone was alleged to have gotten sick," the paper quoted Yolanda 
Thomas as explaining at the time. 
</P>
<P>
And in another county memo to his Ramona staff workers, Bill Bransford, a 
district chief for the Department of Social Services, announced that the 
building would be reopened because "no contamination was found. No symptoms nor 
illnesses that can be attributed to the chemicals stored were found. One 
person, who became very ill, may be suffering from lead poisoning not 
associated with the building." 
</P>
<P>
But Dahlgren, Grisak's doctor, strongly disagrees. 
</P>
<P>
"You can't say the symptoms she had are unique to phosphine, but it was clear 
she did not have symptoms compatible with lead poisoning," he said 
</P>
<P>
Unfortunately, he said, there are no laboratory tests to identify phosphine 
poisoning, so doctors must rely on the symptoms, coupled with the environment 
where the person worked and got sick. 
</P>
<P>
"Her's was a kind of clean case -- she was an office worker with an exposure to 
just one chemical. The only credible explanation that would explain her 
symptoms" was exposure to phosphine, Dahlgren said. 
</P>
