This week, two milestones in the annals of fame (or is it infamy?) are being 
recorded. The first is that Zsa Zsa Gabor has gone on trial for slapping a 
Beverly Hills policeman, disobeying an officer of the law, driving with an 
expired license, having an open container of alcohol in her Rolls-Royce and 
operating a vehicle without registration. 
</P>
<P>
The second is that the "New Hollywood Squares" TV game show has gone off the 
air. 
</P>
<P>
Now, on the surface, these two events don't seem to have much in common. But 
think about it for a minute. 
</P>
<P>
Where was Gabor always welcome no matter who else thought she was a washed-up 
actress? Where could she always count on being photographed at least from the 
waist up? Where was she always allowed to say the most outrageous things 
without risking even a raised eyebrow? 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Incarnated and Reincarnated 
</P>
<P>
"Hollywood Squares," of course. Because in its first inception from 1976 to 
1981, and then in its reincarnation from September, 1986, until its final rerun 
aired last week, the show was a home for people like her. Or, more 
specifically, for People Who Are Famous for Being Famous. 
</P>
<P>
Make fun of PFBFers all you want. Everyone does. But no matter if they were 
spotted hanging out at the old Studio 54 disco in New York, hamming it up on 
the "Love Boat" or hosting late-night cable TV commercials -- all favorite 
haunts -- they've always managed for better or for worse to carve out a hunk of 
space in the public's consciousness. 
</P>
<P>
And how have such PFBF Hall of Famers as Gabor, Charo, Bianca Jagger and George 
Hamilton achieved this reknown despite very little talent, not much physical 
effort and no visible means of financial support? 
</P>
<P>
Through those three S's of Continuous Celebrity -- Sex, Scandal and Staying 
Power. 
</P>
<P>
"They're sort of like pimples," explains Hollywood publicist Michael Levine, 
who represents such PFBFers as Vanna White and Dr. Joyce Brothers as well as 
Non-PFBFers. "They rise to the surface and burst open. Then, some leave a 
scar." 
</P>
<P>
Already, in the days leading up to the courtroom drama of the People of the 
State of California v. Zsa Zsa Gabor, journalists have reported every twist and 
turn no matter how absurd -- from the tidbit that Gabor would wear a basic 
black Donna Karan dress (though she had told some media that the frock was from 
Valentino) to the nubbin that the Society for the Prevention of Anything 
Against Zsa Zsa is selling "Free Zsa Zsa, Dahling" T-shirts for $19.95. And the 
trial itself seems certain to attract almost as much media coverage as, say, 
Oliver North's, Leona Helmsley's or Jim Bakker's, all of whom were at one time 
major figures in the fields of politics, business and religion. 
</P>
<P>
And, yet, amazingly, right up there with them is a Hungarian has-been whose 
only serious acting credit was the 1952 fictional biopic of artist 
Toulouse-Lautrec, "Moulin Rouge." Whose most interesting accomplishment is her 
marriages to eight men. And whose primary contribution to society consists of 
two books ("Zsa Zsa's Complete Guide to Men," and "How to Get a Man, How to 
Keep a Man, How to Get Rid of a Man"), face creams and fake jewelry. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Bevy of Blatherers 
</P>
<P>
Still, that was enough to earn her at least a half-dozen appearances on the 
"New Hollywood Squares" as well as umpteen number on the original version, 
which also managed to make network TV and syndication stars of a bevy of 
blatherers including Paul Lynde, Rose-Marie, Wally Cox, Charlie Weaver and 
George Gobel. Not to be outdone, the "New Hollywood Squares" provided a 
showcase for such wanna-be PFBFers as actor Jm J. Bullock and announcer Shadoe 
Stevens. 
</P>
<P>
"It's easy to make those snide remarks about these people. I probably thought 
that way, too, when I first started," says "New Hollywood Squares" executive 
producer Rick Rosner. 
</P>
<P>
"But book a Charles Nelson Reilly, and you've got a lot of fun. Put Zsa Zsa 
next to ALF, and it's explosive. I used to think if it weren't for these shows, 
where would these people go? But now I know that if it weren't for these 
people, where would these shows be?" 
</P>
<P>
To Rosner, the appeal of PFBFers lies in their personalities. Call it charm, 
call it charisma or just call it a charade. "But many of these guests are 
wonderful guests, and they're just good at being wonderful guests," Rosner 
says. "You could almost say they act like catalysts. They know how to make the 
show interesting." 
</P>
<P>
Leo Braudy, USC's Bing Professor of English and author of "The Frenzy of 
Reknown: Fame and Its History," also believes PFBFers provide a valuable 
community service: to remind us that anyone can become famous. "I think they're 
cozy," he contends. "They present the possibility that you can rise from a log 
cabin and become an aristocrat who does nothing." 
</P>
<P>
PFBFers also share certain characteristics, none of which have anything to do 
with winning Academy Awards, climbing Mt. Everest or performing Mother 
Teresa-like acts of charity (though Gabor was the goodwill ambassador for the 
Montgomery Ward Auto Club in 1980). 
</P>
<P>
Instead, they live for those rare invitations to sit next to Johnny or Arsenio. 
They go into withdrawal if their photographs aren't in the tabloids weekly. 
They can't help acting as if the world owes them a living. They get younger 
with each passing year, thanks to face-lifts and altered driving licenses. They 
cling to their ex-spouses' fame like a life preserver. They rely upon their 
good looks like a life annuity. 
</P>
<P>
And, in the most crucial requirement for active membership, they get into legal 
scrapes, romantic liaisons and business deals as regularly as Gabor hires 
divorce lawyers. 
</P>
<P>
Though few can match Gabor's penchant for playing Peck's Bad Girl -- whether it 
was that ruckus over her dogs on Delta Airlines, or her refusal to act in front 
of a dinner theater audience when some handicapped persons sat in the front row 
-- many have tried. 
</P>
<P>
For years, sometime actress Grace Jones merely lived up to her reputation as an 
obnoxious guest on "Late Night with David Letterman," until she recently found 
herself in real trouble, in a Jamaican jail accused of possessing cocaine. 
</P>
<P>
And Margaret Trudeau didn't limit her bizarre behavior to embarrassing her 
prime minister husband or trailing after the Rolling Stones; she, too, was 
arrested on a drug charge (later dropped). 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
The Name Lingers 
</P>
<P>
In the romantic sector, Apollonia's relationship with Prince may have faded, 
but somehow her name still lingers. Philippe Junot, the French playboy who was 
Princess Caroline's first husband, is still worthy of a tabloid headline. And 
Donna Rice, Fawn Hall and Jessica Hawn continue to be household words after 
their real or imagined celebrity relationships. 
</P>
<P>
Like moths to a flame, advertisers seek out PFBFers with quite lucrative 
consequences. Take, for instance, socialite Cornelia Guest, who calls herself 
an actress even though she hasn't yet secured a part. Nevertheless, her name 
was enough to snare a six-figure deal to hawk a hair product. And actress Jill 
St. John, whose most significant role was dating Henry Kissinger, has a new 
career as a cookbook author and cooking columnist. 
</P>
<P>
The PFBF Hall of Famer, however, manages to hit a home-run on all fronts. 
George Hamilton, for instance, knew his TV and movie career had stalled. Yet he 
found a new lease on life -- or at least, the cover of supermarket tabloids -- 
when he started squiring around Elizabeth Taylor. And today, he is marketing 
not one but two different skin care lines -- an anti-aging cleansing regimen 
advertised on late-night cable TV, and a tanning formula sold in discount 
stores. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
A Sudden Transformation 
</P>
<P>
So, too, has Bianca Jagger succeeded in every category, from her sudden 
transformation from the model of obscurity into the wife of Mick Jagger, to her 
132 mentions in "The Andy Warhol Diaries," most of them so scandalous in nature 
that she is pursuing a lawsuit against the book, to her recent recovery from an 
accident after which, according to a People magazine article, she exercised her 
way back to health. Naturally, an exercise video is afoot. 
</P>
<P>
Even Charo, that wriggling wonder who was a regular on "Hollywood Squares" both 
old and new, parlayed her love affair with geriatric bandleader Xavier Cugat 
into a recurring role on "Love Boat" episodes and most recently ownership of a 
swank Hawaiian restaurant. All she needs now to complete her PFBF profile is a 
late-night cable commercial. 
</P>
<P>
Of course, PFBFers are not to be confused with those other PFBFers -- People 
Who Are Famous for Being Failures. These people also show up on late-night 
cable commercials, like "MASH" star McLean Stevenson, whose bald spot grabs the 
spotlight these days in an ad for a hair-loss remedy, or former Hugh Hefner 
playmate Barbi Benton, who now sells piano-playing videotapes. 
</P>
<P>
If in doubt, true PFBFers -- that is, People Who Are Famous for Being Famous -- 
can always be measured by their ability to turn out a crowd. Indeed, they know 
how to create a media event with the same native instinct that salmon use to 
swim upstream, like the time that Bianca rented a Malibu beach house, rounded 
up reporters and announced the start of her film career, which didn't last 
nearly as long as her press conference. 
</P>
<P>
And what about Richard "Mr." Blackwell's annual Worst-Dressed List, which has 
been a lot more famous than his dress designs over the years. 
</P>
<P>
Or consider the time that Zsa Zsa almost created a riot while posing for 
photographers at London's Heathrow Airport in 1973 wearing nothing but 
stockings under her fur coat. "It was hot on the plane, dahling," she cooed. "I 
just had to peel off." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Garnered Certain Tributes 
</P>
<P>
And by keeping herself in the media eye, Gabor has received certain tributes 
that many would envy, from lecturing at colleges (Saddleback College's 
Celebrity Series) to receiving political honors (guest speaker at a 
$1,000-a-plate dinner for the Michigan GOP party). 
</P>
<P>
In the end, the real secret of the success of People Who Are Famous for Being 
Famous is the fact that we talk about them at all. "If the audience didn't 
respond to these people, they wouldn't exist," says academic Braudy. "It's all 
for our benefit." 
</P>
<P>
Publicist Levine agrees. "Why are they famous? The fault lies in ourselves, not 
in our stars." 
</P>
<P>
And while few things about the future can be called certain, two things surely 
are. The first is that Zsa Zsa Gabor will make headlines again. 
</P>
<P>
And the second, says producer Rosner, is that "in four or five years' time, 
'Hollywood Squares' will be resurrected. And, once again, we'll all wonder 
why." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>

</P>
