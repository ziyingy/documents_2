In the aftermath of Hollywood's race for the rights to the story of Chico 
Mendes, the martyred Brazilian rubber tapper who fought to save the rain forest 
from cattle ranchers, a crop of films with rain forest themes or backdrops has 
taken root. 
</P>
<P>
First to blossom: Columbia Picture's "The Fifth Monkey," starring Ben Kingsley 
as a hunter journeying from forest to city, encountering a woman and four 
monkeys that change his life. It's due Oct. 5 from producer Menahem Golan and 
21st Century Pictures. Eric Rochat directs.

actor Kari Vaananen, Robert Davi and Rae Dawn Chong. Finland's Mika Kaurismaki 
directs, co-produces. Distributor not set.

* "At Play in the Fields of the Lord," based on the Peter Matthiessen novel, 
now filming in Brazil. Hector Babenco directs and co-writes the screenplay in 
which missionaries, soldiers-of-fortune and developers scheme to push the 
Indians out of the forest. Produced by Saul Zaentz, the $28-million film stars 
Tom Berenger, John Lithgow, Daryl Hannah, Aidan Quinn, Kathy Bates and Tom 
Waits.

As for the Mendes project, Warner Bros., producing with David Puttnam and 
Brazilian-based J.N. Filmes, has approved a screenplay outline by William 
Mastrosimone, based partly on Andrew Revkin's nonfiction book about Mendes' 
murder, "The Burning Season."

<P>
Neither a director nor start date is set, according to Colin Vaines, director 
of development for Puttnam's London-based Enigma Prod.

The battle for the rights to Mendes' story -- including such participants as 
Redford, Steven Spielberg and Ted Turner -- was the subject of headlines in the 
summer of 1989. 
</P>
<P>
"It's fair to say that all of us were slightly aghast at how things got out of 
hand," says Vaines. "All that bidding -- for the story of a man who led a 
modest life.
