Stocks fell Monday in the slowest session in four years, as pre-Christmas 
trading was dominated by fears about the tension in the Persian Gulf and Soviet 
Union. 
</P>
<P>
The Dow Jones industrial index fell 12.37 to close at 2,621.29. Declining 
shares led advances 862 to 511 on paltry New York Stock Exchange volume of 57.2 
million shares, compared to 233.4 million Friday. 
</P>
<P>
The session, shortened by two hours for the holiday, was the slowest since 48.9 
million shares changed hands Dec. 26, 1986. 
</P>
<P>
Sharp losses on the bond market also discouraged stock investors. 
</P>
<P>
Comments over the weekend from U.S. and Iraqi officials heightened concerns 
about a possible Persian Gulf war. 
</P>
<P>
Iraqi President Saddam Hussein said in an interview with Spanish television 
that Tel Aviv would be his first target if war broke out. 
</P>
<P>
In addition, Defense Secretary Dick Cheney said that Iraq showed no sign of 
planning to withdraw from Kuwait and that the clock was ticking toward war. 
</P>
<P>
The resignation of Soviet Foreign Minister Eduard A. Shevardnadze last week has 
also raised concerns about the Soviet Union's political stability. 
</P>
<P>
"All this talk is making people nervous," said Ladenburg Thalmann's Richard 
Meyer. 
</P>
<P>
"It's the combination of worry about a revolution in Russia and (concerns about 
the) Mideast," said Phil Roth, chief technical analyst at Dean Witter. 
</P>
<P>
"One of the factors here is the small attendance," said Gene Jay Seagle, 
Gruntal &amp; Co.'s director of research. "It's a lack of buying rather than a 
lot of selling." 
</P>
<P>
Still, some analysts believe that stock prices could stage a rally after 
Christmas. 
</P>
<P>
"We usually see a Santa Claus rally in the last four days of the old year and 
first two of the New Year," Larry Wachtel at Prudential-Bache Securities said. 
</P>
<P>
Among the market highlights: 
</P>

merit. Halliburton rose 1/4 to 44.

heightened Middle East war talk. 
</P>
<P>
The Treasury's bellwether 30-year bond dropped 25/32 point, or $7.81 per $1,000 
in face amount. Its yield rose to 8.35% from 8.29% late Friday. 
</P>

</P>
<P>

the holiday in the early afternoon. 
</P>
<P>
In New York, the dollar rose to a closing 1.5453 German marks from late

Wheat Prices Rise on Weather Damage 
</P>
<P>
Wheat futures prices rose moderately Monday on the Chicago Board of Trade in a 
late rally linked to new export sales and fears of weather damage to the winter 
wheat crop. 
</P>
<P>
Oat futures also advanced, while corn and soybean futures ended mostly lower on 
light volume in a shortened Christmas Eve trading session. 
</P>
<P>
Most cattle futures rose, and pork futures finished mostly lower in a shortened 
session on the Chicago Mercantile Exchange. Other U.S. commodity markets were 
closed. 
</P>
<P>
Wheat futures settled 1 3/4 to 5 cents higher, with the contract for delivery 
in March at $2.64 1/4 a bushel; corn was 1 1/4 cents lower to 1/2 cent higher, 
with March at $2.33 1/4 a bushel; oats were 1/2 cent to 1 1/4 cents higher, 
with March at $1.12 1/2 a bushel, and soybeans were 1 3/4 cents lower to 1 1/4 
cents higher, with January at $5.62 1/4 a bushel. 
</P>
<P>
Wheat futures drew some support from news of government-subsidized sales of 
U.S. wheat to Colombia, Yemen and Sri Lanka, analysts said. 
</P>
<P>
The rally also reflected speculation about possible damage to the winter wheat 
crop after nearly a week of record-breaking frigid weather in the Great Plains, 
said Victor Lespinasse, an assistant vice president in the grain trading 
division of Dean Witter Reynolds Inc.
