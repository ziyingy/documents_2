Who speaks for the malt? The malted milkshake occupies a safe but basically 
humble position in the soda fountain repertory. Probably nobody downing a malt 
-- whether the classic '30s and '40s foamy variety or the post-'50s semi-frozen 
sort -- suspects its colorful and downright heroic history. Disease! 
Starvation! Prohibitionism! The South Pole!

Technically speaking, malt is a mixture of sugars produced from starch. The 
thing that converts the starch is an enzyme with the silly-sounding name 
gibberellin, which is secreted by grain as it sprouts. Eventually the enzyme 
action is stopped by roasting the malt, which also caramelizes some of the 
sugars and produces attractive toasted flavors.

Mostly malt is fermented and turned into beer or whiskey. However, malt sugars 
are easy to digest, and 19th Century doctors often prescribed malt for children 
and invalids. There were problems with it, though. In liquid form it tended to 
ferment, and for years every attempt to produce a stable dried form of malt 
failed.

The man who succeeded in making malt powder was William Horlick, an Englishman 
who emigrated to Chicago in the 1870s. His process consisted of drying malt 
extract with wheat extract in a vacuum. He called the resulting product 
Horlick's Food, patented it and set up a business in Racine, Wis. (where he 
also married a woman who must have been a cousin -- her maiden name was 
Arabella Horlick). 
</P>
<P>
Doctors blessed his name and prescribed their patients Horlick's Food, which 
made a tasty drink when mixed with milk. However, in the late 19th Century, 
cow's milk was often unwholesome. Before modern refrigeration and 
pasteurization (which did not become universal until the '40s), milk was 
commonly infected with diseases, such as the dreaded tuberculosis. The 19th 
Century expression "the summer sickness" referred to diseases spread by milk. 
</P>
<P>
Horlick was unhappy about this, so he conceived the idea of making a form of 
Horlick's Food that wouldn't have to be mixed with milk. In 1882 he perfected 
the process of drying milk right along with the wheat and malt, making a 
product that only needed to be mixed with water. 
</P>

It was a convenience food as well as a health food. Travelers carried it to the 
tropics, the Himalayas and the Poles. Horlick's Malted Milk Tablets were 
renowned as a cheap, reliable food during the Depression, when they were a 
standard item in school and work lunch pails. Even as late as the '50s, members 
of the Depression generation often made sure to keep malted milk tablets in the 
pantry for emergencies.

All of these attractions would have made Horlick's business a success, but as 
it happened, there was another factor at that particular time as well. In the 
late 19th Century, the Temperance Movement was constantly trying to wean men 
away from saloons. One bright idea along these lines was the milk bar, also 
known as the ice cream parlor or soda fountain, where only ice cream and 
nonalcoholic beverages were served. 
</P>
<P>
Malted milk was a natural for the soda fountain. It was not only nonalcoholic 
but regarded as healthful. American taste turned a health food into a pleasure 
food, as it would later do with peanut butter and granola. 
</P>
<P>
With tens of thousands of ice cream parlors making him a wealthy man, Horlick 
became a public benefactor. He donated a school, a hospital and a park to the 
city of Racine. He supported wholesome youth movements like the Boy Scouts. 
</P>
<P>
And probably out of a sense of gratitude to the Scandinavians of Wisconsin, he 
donated to many Norwegian causes. When King Haakon of Norway made him the first 
American to receive the Order of St. Olaf, it was because Horlick had been one 
of the principal backers of Roald Amundsen's expedition to find the South Pole. 
</P>
<P>
If you look at a map of Antarctica today, you will find proof. About 125 miles 
from the Pole -- a little closer than the Wisconsin Range -- you will find the 
Horlick Mountains. The man to whom ice cream had been so good is memorialized 
in the continent of ice.
