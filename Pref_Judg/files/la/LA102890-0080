Throughout our lives my wife and I have enjoyed companionship of both dogs and 
cats who enriched our lives with their loyalty and devotion.

For that reason, we will vote yes on Proposition C.

Animals benefit from animal research. Vaccines developed from animal research 
now protect pets and domestic animals from diseases that were fatal not too 
long ago.

<P>
Humans also are dependent on animal research. Medical procedures first tested 
on animals have saved the lives of uncounted humans. We believe that the 
conditions of medical research are entirely adequate to protect the well-being 
of abandoned pound animals who would otherwise be destroyed.
