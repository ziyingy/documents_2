The white wall beside the front door of Hella-Barbara Rank's home and studio in 
Brentwood reads "Villa d'Esperance" -- the house of hope.

For the German-born clothing designer who relocated here in the late '80s, it 
has indeed been a house of hope, a place to restart a fashion career by way of 
a small-scale couture business. 
</P>
<P>
After 7 1/2 years of fashion education and training at the Munich Fashion 
School and various designing jobs in Munich-based couture houses, Hella-Barbara 
Jahke unexpectedly found herself moving to Mexico to become the art director of 
Vanity, a large clothing company. At the end of 15 years in Mexico, she married 
an American and moved to Los Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
Now divorced, she turned to designing, which seemed the logical choice, 
"because it was what I learned and what I did best." 
</P>
<P>
"My clothing has a terribly understated style that's nothing like Hollywood."

Her fabrics are opulent: brocade, quilted iridescent taffeta, silk chiffon and 
organza, sheer lace and crushed velvet. But shapes are clean and simple -- 
fingertip-length cardigans are the basic pieces upon which the entire 
collection revolves. These long and lean jackets are paired with a choice of 
short skirts, palazzo pants, lean trousers or sweeping floor-length skirts, 
usually of a different fabric.

Prices for a complete outfit start at about $1,000.

In California, the studio is the only place to purchase her label.
