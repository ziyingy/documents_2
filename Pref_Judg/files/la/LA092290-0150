Especially poignant and praiseworthy was festival director Peter Sellars' 
invitation to the local Native American community to participate. The inclusion 
of indigenous American artists and performers, the reverence and respect for 
Native American spirituality and the opportunity for the traditional, 
indigenous cultures of the Pacific Rim to share their arts will have a deep and 
long-lasting effect on all who were able to be there and even those who 
weren't.
