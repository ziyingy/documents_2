Sylmar -- once viewed as the quiet, rural outback of Los Angeles -- was the 
fastest-growing community in the city during the 1980s, with a 30.7% population 
increase for the decade and an almost equal growth rate in housing 
construction, according to city figures released Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
The community has topped the city's population growth every year since 1982. 
Its population surged from 41,922 in 1980 to 54,779 in 1989, city planners 
said. 
</P>
<P>
San Pedro, which experienced a development boom in private and military housing 
in the mid-1980s, was the second fastest growing area in Los Angeles in the 
decade just ended, with a 21.7% population increase. Arleta, which is next to 
Sylmar, ranked third with an 18.7% growth rate, city planning statistics 
showed. 
</P>
<P>
The population of the San Fernando Valley portion of Los Angeles grew 12.2% 
from 1980 to 1989, rising from 1,017,365 people to 1,142,447. 
</P>
<P>
The overall population of Los Angeles grew 11.6% between 1980 and 1989 to more 
than 3.3 million people, according to the estimates. The figures, released by 
the city Planning Department, are based on census data, statistics from the 
city's Building and Safety Department and utility bills. 
</P>
<P>
The San Fernando Valley was the scene of the biggest housing boom in the city 
in the last decade with a 14.8% increase to 58,915 new dwelling units. Planners 
said 48% of all new housing in the city was built in the Valley, which is home 
to about a third of the city's population. 
</P>
<P>
The accelerated population growth in the northeast Valley, which includes 
Sylmar and Arleta, was spurred by the completion of the Foothill Freeway in 
1981 and the availability of large swaths of undeveloped land. Almost overnight 
a remote section of the city became easily accessible by freeway. 
</P>
<P>
Apartments and condominiums now flank Sylmar's busy Foothill Boulevard, once a 
two-lane road bordered by sprawling ranch houses and stables. Spacious tract 
homes have crept into the foothills of the San Gabriel Mountains. 
</P>
<P>
The population boom has prompted a series of interim development control 
measures in Sylmar, which is the first of the city's 35 planning areas to 
undergo general plan revisions to draft new growth control regulations. 
</P>
<P>
"When you look at the city as a whole, population has increased at a strong, 
healthy rate," said City Planner Jeffrey Beckerman. "But certain areas 
individually have grown much faster than others." 
</P>
<P>
The three most crowded areas of Los Angeles are the Westlake, Wilshire and 
South-Central districts with an average of 47, 28 and 23 people respectively 
living on one acre of land. By contrast, there is plenty of elbow room in 
Bel-Air and Brentwood, where an average of only two residents share one acre of 
land, and Sunland, where there are three people per acre. 
</P>
<P>
The most densely populated Valley communities are North Hollywood with 15 
residents per acre, followed by Van Nuys with 14. After Sunland, residents in 
Sun Valley and Porter Ranch have the most space, with five residents per acre.
