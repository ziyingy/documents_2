Ben Davidian relishes the fact that he's visited just about every outpost under 
his jurisdiction as the U.S. Immigration and Naturalization Service's top 
official in the West. He remembers a visit he paid Christmas Eve on 
unsuspecting Border Patrol agents near Nogales, Ariz. 
</P>
<P>
"Can we do something for you?" several uniformed agents asked Davidian, not 
recognizing him to be the INS Western regional commissioner. "Well," he 
replied, "I was hoping to do something for you." 
</P>
<P>
After a few more questions, the embarrassed agents figured out who Davidian 
was. 
</P>
<P>
"I'll say this," one agent later confided, "any man who wants to freeze his 
buns with us on the Mexican border on Christmas Eve is OK by me." 
</P>
<P>
The episode seems to say much about the 38-year-old Sacramento lawyer in the 
six months since he succeeded the controversial and colorful Harold Ezell as 
one of four regional INS commissioners in the United States. He enjoys meeting 
many of the immigration service's 5,500 employees in his sprawling region that 
encompasses California, Nevada, Arizona, Hawaii and the Pacific island of Guam. 
</P>
<P>
The problem, according to his critics, is that he isn't meeting the right kind 
of people. 
</P>
<P>
Davidian has been attacked -- both inside and outside the INS -- as being an 
"invisible commissioner" who is afraid to meet with adversaries in the 
immigration field who are interested in finding out his views on important 
issues. 
</P>
<P>
He also has been accused of being a weak leader and being afraid of making 
decisions that might anger superiors in Washington. 
</P>
<P>
Part of the criticism stems from Davidian's avowed intention to reverse Ezell's 
publicity-seeking posture and turn the spotlight back to the "hard-working, 
dedicated (INS) men and women in the field." For example, he makes no apology 
for the fact that he has not yet held a news conference to articulate his views 
or those of the INS. 
</P>
<P>
In doing so, critics believe Davidian's silence has helped undermine the morale 
of many INS bureaucrats and has given a subtle message to Southern California's 
large immigrant population that it can expect little help from him. 
</P>
<P>
"He's an invisible commissioner who has done little to reach out to immigrant 
communities," said Linda Mitchell, a top official with a coalition of immigrant 
rights groups in Los Angeles. "I mean, who knows who he is?" 
</P>
<P>
Ernest Gustafson, who retired last September as INS district director in Los 
Angeles, added: "My concern is that the silence out of the INS is very negative 
for the community. It could develop into a curtain blocking the INS from the 
communities it is trying to serve. 
</P>
<P>
"Six months have gone by and we don't know anything new about him or the INS." 
</P>
<P>
Davidian rejected the criticism, saying that controversy comes with the 
territory. 
</P>
<P>
"This is a job that is not going to make friends with everybody," Davidian said 
in an interview at INS regional headquarters in Laguna Niguel. "You cannot have 
a job that deals with enforcement as well as service and expect everybody to 
like what you do." 
</P>
<P>
Several problems have cropped up that critics say could have been avoided if 
Davidian were a more aggressive executive: 
</P>
<P>
* The post left vacant by Gustafson's retirement, considered by many to be the 
second most important agency job in the West, is not filled. Without a 
replacement at the top, INS staffers say morale has plummeted in the downtown 
Los Angeles office while Davidian and officials in Washington deliberate about 
who should be appointed. 
</P>
<P>
* Davidian's office is lax in persuading aliens to complete their amnesty 
applications under the latest phase of the landmark immigration reform law. To 
achieve legal residency, applicants must complete courses on U.S. history and 
English by November. To date, 70% of the 1 million applicants in the West have 
completed the second step, but critics say the percentage could be much higher 
if Davidian was personally involved. 
</P>
<P>
* Davidian's views on various immigration issues, such as political asylum and 
increased funding for the agency, are unknown. Davidian said he chooses not to 
talk publicly about his views, partly because that is the job of his boss, INS 
Commissioner Gene McNary in Washington. 
</P>
<P>
* Some Latino activists involved in immigration work accuse Davidian of 
refusing to meet with them. He rejects that charge, saying he has met in recent 
months with representatives from such well-known Latino organizations as the 
American GI Forum and the League of United Latin American Citizens (LULAC). 
</P>
<P>
But Arnold Torres, national political adviser for LULAC, said those contacts 
were unauthorized and not substantive. "Since August, we have repeatedly sought 
meetings with him but he has officially closed the door after our opposition to 
the confirmation of McNary as INS commissioner." 
</P>
<P>
Such criticism does not seem to faze Davidian, a man of reserved demeanor who 
chaired the California Agriculture Labor Relations Board for 2 1/2 years as an 
appointee of Republican Gov. George Deukmejian before assuming the INS post 
Aug. 15. 
</P>
<P>
Davidian said he has worked hard to forge links with some Asian, Latino and 
other ethnic groups, adding that he's willing to meet with members of 
"responsible groups" when his schedule permits it. 
</P>
<P>
To the criticism that he has been slow in appointing a Los Angeles district 
director to replace Gustafson, Davidian said he takes "full responsibility." 
</P>
<P>
"I'd love to fill that job," he said. But he said McNary, who must have a hand 
in the selection, is still relatively new to his post and has other items to 
deal with first. 
</P>
<P>
"It's such an important job that I think we'll be very slow, very 
deliberative," Davidian said. 
</P>
<P>
Some of Davidian's strongest supporters are those who work with him at the INS 
Laguna Niguel headquarters. They give him top marks in his first six months. 
</P>
<P>
"He's very popular with the people who work with him," said career INS official 
William King, who is in charge of the amnesty effort in the West. "He's very 
bright, very energetic. He's playing it low-key until he learns his job 
properly." 
</P>
<P>
Even Ezell, whose publicity stunts and outrageous statements sometimes got him 
into hot water with higher-ups during his six-year tenure as INS Western 
regional commissioner, has kudos for Davidian. 
</P>
<P>
"I've heard nothing but good things about him from guys close in (who work with 
Davidian)," Ezell said. "And they ought to know." 
</P>
<P>
Officials within the Justice Department, which oversees the INS, say Davidian's 
demeanor is a marked improvement over Ezell's flamboyant, controversial style. 
Ezell came under fire for threatening to cut off federal funds to cities that 
supported the sanctuary movement for Central American refugees and once 
embarrassed the agency by attending a party thrown by Ferdinand and Imelda 
Marcos at a time when they were under investigation by the Justice Department 
for allegedly stealing tens of millions of dollars from the Philippines 
treasury. 
</P>
<P>
Davidian, who favors pinstripe suits and button-down collars, would never be 
mistaken for Ezell, who repeatedly donned a Mexican sombrero to publicize 
amnesty. 
</P>
<P>
"Davidian's not running around with sombreros on, talking all kinds of stuff 
that was not cleared with anybody in Washington," said one Justice Department 
official, who asked not to be identified. "He's competent, steady and working 
hard." 
</P>
<P>
But there are others inside the INS Western region who accuse Davidian of being 
a "wimp" who is afraid of offending his superiors. The criticism is so stinging 
that they asked not to be identified. 
</P>
<P>
"He's a joke, a political hack," said one INS middle-manager. "We ought to have 
INS professionals running the show." 
</P>
<P>
Said another mid-level official inside the agency: "His office has copies of 
correspondence stacked from the floor to the ceiling waiting for his signature 
for several weeks because he is afraid of making a decision. He hasn't filled 
the L.A. job yet. He manages like a puppet by only reacting when Washington 
tells him how and when to take action. 
</P>
<P>
"Ezell was overzealous but Davidian is the invisible wimp behind his closed 
office door." 
</P>
<P>
Davidian said his door is always open and does not understand the criticism by 
those under him. 
</P>
<P>
"I have to say I have an open-door policy and I can't meet with everybody who 
wants to meet with me," he said. "I've never had . . . somebody walk up to me 
and tell me we have a morale problem that has anything to do with what I'm 
doing." 
</P>
<P>
Davidian's reluctance to speak out publicly is tied to a restrictive policy 
imposed on the INS by McNary, who followed the lead of his boss, Atty. Gen. 
Dick Thornburgh. 
</P>
<P>
Last November, Thornburgh started a campaign within the Justice Department 
against unauthorized leaks to reporters. McNary then issued a directive 
requiring that all news media inquiries, unless they are of the most routine 
nature, be cleared with INS headquarters in Washington. It requires 
Washington's approval before any INS official, including ranking ones like 
Davidian, can speak officially with a reporter. 
</P>
<P>
But in the months since the policy began, overly cautious immigration officials 
at every level have checked with Washington before releasing any information. 
Recently, when one official at the Laguna Niguel regional headquarters was 
asked for his title, he replied that he would have to get clearance from 
Washington. 
</P>
<P>
The official never called back. 
</P>
<P>
Davidian refuses to be drawn into a debate on the issue. 
</P>
<P>
But Ezell, who was never shy about voicing his opinions, said he opposes the 
new policy. 
</P>
<P>
"The attorney general can be the one spokesman for the Justice Department and 
that's his decision," Ezell said. "But it's a lousy one. He's not omnipresent. 
You have a department with qualified appointees who are commissioners. That's 
what you got them there for. The attorney general's 3,000 miles away from the 
action." 
</P>
<P>
Furthermore, Ezell said, the aggressive public posture the agency took during 
the Reagan Administration is "going down the tubes." 
</P>
<P>
Instead of reacting to the criticism, Davidian is content to go out and meet 
the troops and face the challenges of his job, even if he lacks Ezell's 
showmanship. 
</P>
<P>
One of those challenges is the agency's growing role in the interdiction of 
illegal drugs smuggled across the U.S.-Mexican border. 
</P>
<P>
The INS role in the drug war comes at a time when Bush Administration officials 
admit there are dwindling funds for an already overworked immigration service. 
</P>
<P>
Davidian said he was surprised when he learned how much drugs his Border Patrol 
agents are seizing while apprehending illegal aliens. 
</P>
<P>
"One day, a coyote (alien smuggler) may be bringing over undocumented aliens. 
The next day, he or she may be bringing over marijuana. The next day, it may be 
cocaine and the next day, it may be undocumented aliens again," Davidian said. 
</P>
<P>
"We didn't go looking for the war on drugs. It came to us." 
</P>
