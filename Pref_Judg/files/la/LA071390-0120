This summer's newest hairstyles come straight from the history books -- 1960s 
history, that is. Back-combed "bubbles," wash-and-wear geometrics, and 
hippie-like, long, straight styles are being reshaped. 
</P>
<P>
At Cristophe and Vidal Sassoon, two top Beverly Hills salons, recent shows 
featured versions of looks first seen on the pages of Vogue and Harper's Bazaar 
more than 20 years ago. 
</P>
<P>
In Cristophe's show, 20-year-old Samantha Klink modeled a blond flip like 
socialite-actress Dina Merrill wore in the 1960s. Klink's version had long 
bangs that almost obscured her heavily made-up eyes. "I look exactly like my 
mother did in high school," the model cooed. "She was so cool." 
</P>
<P>
This particular nostalgia kick has been building for some time. For Guess? 
jeans ads, model Claudia Schiffer started wearing a '60s Bridget Bardot 
hairstyle more than a year ago. Her messy blond bangs and wispy French twist 
had an obvious impact. But it was the tousled, piled-up topknot that Ivana 
Trump wore on the May cover of Vogue that brought the Bardot look mainstream. 
</P>
<P>
Demi Moore's newest hairstyle for the movie "Ghost" is a short, wispy bubble 
reminiscent of the boy cut worn by '60s model Twiggy. Jodie Foster went '60s 
when she wore a sleek, one-length style -- a clone of Barbra Streisand's 
post-"Funny Girl" look -- to the Academy Awards. 
</P>
<P>
The resurgence of interest in '60s fashion has fueled the hair revival. A 
number of vintage items, including hip-hugger pants, Pucci prints, and 
Courreges and Rudi Gernreich dresses -- all copied by fashion designers today 
-- still look best with the hairstyles that were created for them. 
</P>
<P>
"But it's more than just the fashion," explains Cristophe, owner of the Beverly 
Drive salon. "Look at politics, the current peace movement, the environmental 
concern. And everyone is fascinated with the music again. The entire decade is 
back." 
</P>
<P>
Aitch Peters, senior creative director at the Sassoon salon in Beverly Hills, 
says that after his recent style show, "dozens of women have come in, talking 
about '60s hairdos and asking for a '90s version of the look." To Peters, the 
new styles are derivatives of the original wash-and-wears Sassoon popularized 
in the mid-'60s, but they are "softer, less hard-edged. There's also more 
versatility to the cut. Today women want to be able to wear their hair more 
than one way." 
</P>
<P>
Long hair allows for the most versatility. At the Cristophe show, blunt-cut 
shoulder-length hair was swept up into French twists and top-knots, slicked off 
the face into tight chignons worn at the crown, or worn long and straight, 
reminiscent of singer-actress Cher when she was still wearing bell-bottoms and 
singing with her then husband, Sonny Bono. The hair was bone straight. 
</P>
<P>
Says Cristophe, "Right now perms are out, unless they are very soft and only 
slightly wavy. No more curls." 
</P>
<P>
Most of the styles shown by Sassoon were short, above-the-chin length cuts. In 
their original versions, typical geometric cuts from Sassoon looked one way all 
the time and demanded constant trims to maintain a sharp, well-defined 
perimeter. "That kind of precision look is not part of this new take on the 
'60s," says Peters. 
</P>
<P>
Neither is heavy back-combing, or "teasing" as it was called then. Eric 
Lintermans, owner of Lintermans La Coupe in Beverly Hills, predicts that women 
won't tease their hair to achieve the definitive high crown of the 1960s. 
</P>
<P>
Instead, he says, "The fullness is achieved with a cut." Lintermans adds, 
"Women have grown accustomed to hair that can be touched. They won't give that 
up. In the '60s men were afraid to touch a woman's hair for fear of ruining an 
expensive hairdo. That won't work anymore." 
</P>
<P>
Another hallmark of the '60s that doesn't work now is the roller, which helped 
to shape bubbles and beehives of the early part of that decade. Today rollers 
have been replaced by blow-dryers, round hairbrushes and high-tech hair 
mousses, gels and sprays. These products make it possible to style an updated 
bubble shape like the one Kenneth, New York's king of hair creations in the 
'60s, designed (without rollers) in 1961 for First Lady Jacqueline Kennedy. 
</P>
<P>
Likewise, those who want the ultra-straight looks of the later '60s won't have 
to resort to pressing their long hair on ironing boards. Wide, flat brushes and 
gels and sprays that straighten as well as mold hair into shape, produce the 
look now. 
</P>
<P>
With the return of '60s hairdos comes a resurgence in interest in hairpieces. 
Falls and postiches (shorter than a fall and used to add fullness) positioned 
high on the crown give the extra height that defined many of the most popular 
teased styles 25 years ago. They are worn with wide headbands, reminiscent of 
those Elizabeth Taylor wore when she was being courted by Richard Burton. At 
the Cristophe show one model wore a short postiche topped with another that was 
shaped into a wide bow of hair that hinted of the past, yet looked thoroughly 
modern. 
</P>
<P>
If the current homage to '60s hair doesn't quite work, it is because stylists 
are attempting to compress all the hairdos of the decade into the trend. In 
their day, these styles represented several mini fashion revolutions, and the 
time span between each new look was in keeping with the changes in fashion and, 
more importantly, society. 
</P>
<P>
A bubble was right for the Camelot days of the early '60s, Sassoon's geometrics 
were in keeping with the mod mood of '64, and long, shapeless looks were suited 
to the flower children of the latter part of the decade. But taken out of 
context, these styles become a humorous collage, destined to be a short-lived 
fad rather than a revolution. Like most retro looks, they may be a means of 
biding time until a truly new style emerges. As Lintermans, who has been 
styling hair since the early '60s points out, "I can't believe that women will 
be serious about these looks. It's fun for now."
