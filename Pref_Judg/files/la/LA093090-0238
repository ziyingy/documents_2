Many recycling centers do not accept hazardous wastes commonly found around the 
home, such as car batteries, paints and oven cleaners. But with a little extra 
effort, those products can be recycled too -- or at least disposed of properly. 
</P>
<P>
Several government agencies hold periodic hazardous waste roundups, where 
household wastes of all types are collected for free. The County Sanitation 
Districts has tentatively scheduled its next roundup Oct. 20 at Hollywood Park 
in Inglewood. For information, call (213) 908-4286.

Los Angeles also sponsors municipal roundups, although none is scheduled. To 
get on the city's mailing list for announcements about upcoming collections, 
call (213) 237-1634. Contact your local city government for information about 
roundups in other cities.

The publishers of "The Recycler's Handbook: Simple Things You Can Do," 
scheduled to be in bookstores Nov. 15, make suggestions about how best to 
handle household wastes that are difficult to recycle. The book is available by 
sending $4.95 plus tax and a $1 shipping fee to the EarthWorks Group, 1400 
Shattuck Ave., 25, Berkeley, Calif. 94709, or by calling (415) 841-5866.

Among the recommendations: 
</P>
<P>
* BATTERIES. If a service station changes your battery, check to make sure it 
will be recycled. If you replace your own battery, buy the new one from a 
retailer who will recycle the old one. If you cannot find someone to recycle an 
old battery, take it to a hazardous waste facility or to a hazardous waste 
roundup. Do not store old batteries for any length of time in your garage or 
house. 
</P>
<P>
* MOTOR OIL. If a gas station changes your oil, check to make sure it will be 
recycled. If not, take your car elsewhere. If you change your own oil, store it 
in a screw-cap container that will not leak, such as a plastic milk jug, or use 
a recycling kit available in hardware and automotive stores. Avoid spilling oil 
on the ground, where it will leak into ground water or wash into storm drains 
-- and eventually go into the ocean. Take old oil to collection sites at gas 
stations and garages or to a hazardous waste facility or roundup. 
</P>
<P>
* PAINT. If old latex paints still look fresh, mix them together and use them 
as a primer. Some communities have paint exchange programs, where people bring 
reusable paint to trade or give away. Check with your city government. Unusable 
paint should be disposed of at a hazardous waste facility or roundup. 
</P>
<P>
* PAINT THINNER. Put used thinner in a jar. After it settles, reuse the clean 
thinner on top and let the sediment sink to the bottom. When enough sediment 
accumulates, dispose of it at a hazardous waste facility or roundup. 
</P>
<P>
* HOUSEHOLD PRODUCTS. The EPA estimates that 25% of hazardous wastes comes from 
homes. The culprits include lighter fluid, pesticides, furniture polish, nail 
polish, nail polish remover, drain openers, scouring powders, oven and toilet 
bowl cleaners, caulk, mothballs and adhesives. Give unneeded products to 
neighbors or friends who could use them or properly store and label them for 
future use. Otherwise, take them to a hazardous waste facility or roundup.
