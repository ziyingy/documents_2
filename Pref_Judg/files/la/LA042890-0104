For Roger Richman, fame came only after he hit the wall. 
</P>
<P>
Richman is that guy in the Chrysler TV commercial who nonchalantly buckles 
himself into a Plymouth Acclaim, then drives it smack into a concrete, 
steel-enforced wall at 21 m.p.h. That might not sound like much, but experts 
say that's the rough equivalent of hitting another moving car at 50 m.p.h. 
</P>
<P>
The highly dramatic commercial -- the first one to ever replace a crash dummy 
with a real person -- was filmed last month on a landing strip at Inyokern 
Airport in Kern County, about 150 miles north of Los Angeles in the Mojave 
Desert. 
</P>
<P>
The ad promotes Chrysler's placement of air bags in all of its American-built 
cars. 
</P>
<P>
Richman, a 37-year-old Hollywood Hills resident and professional stunt driver, 
said the mental and physical impact of driving that car into the wall has 
persuaded him to trade in his Ford Bronco for a car with air bags. 
</P>
<P>
"I knew that I was strictly a live piece of meat," said Richman, who is 
employed by Hollywood-based Drivers Inc. "But it's rare that we stunt drivers 
get to do something that might benefit mankind. How many lives have been saved 
by watching stunt drivers on 'The A-Team' or 'Starsky &amp; Hutch?' " 
</P>
<P>
More than altruism attracted him to appear in the commercial. Besides the pay 
-- which he declined to reveal -- the ad represented that one chance in a 
million for a stunt driver to get his mug on TV. Stunt drivers' faces are 
rarely shown in films or on television because they're standing in for another 
actor. But this time, Richman was no one but himself. 
</P>
<P>
In the 30-second ad, Richman, dressed in street clothes, walks up to a Plymouth 
Acclaim, opens the driver's door and tosses out a crash dummy. He then sits in 
the driver's seat, buckles his seat belt and proceeds to drive his car into a 
specially built, steel-reinforced concrete wall, without so much as wincing. 
</P>
<P>
"They wanted me to act as if I didn't know what was coming," said Richman, who 
used only standard lap and shoulder restraints. "So I tried to defocus my 
vision to not see the wall." 
</P>
<P>
The car used in the stunt was right off a dealer's lot and was not specially 
prepared in any way. 
</P>
<P>
Seconds before the crash, tension on the set was great. "We were naturally 
quite concerned about safety," said Sidney Rothberg, executive producer of 
Werner Hlinka Products, which filmed the ad created by the Minneapolis office 
of Bozell Inc. "Not only would we have contributed to injuring the driver, but 
the negative publicity surrounding such an accident would have been disastrous 
both for our company and for Chrysler." 
</P>
<P>
Immediately upon impact, Richman's air bag exploded open and completely 
cushioned the blow, but Richman hardly remembers it. "I didn't even realize 
that the bag came out," he said. "It all happened so fast." 
</P>
<P>
After the crash, Richman steps out of the car, unharmed. "If you're looking at 
a Japanese car, see if it's got an air bag," says an off-camera narrator. "Then 
ask yourself if you can live without one." 
</P>
<P>
Paramedics stood by, just in case something went wrong. They also examined 
Richman immediately after the crash. 
</P>
<P>
"It was the hardest hit I've ever taken in my career," Richman said. "I never 
thought I'd die from the crash, but if the bag had failed, I knew broken bones 
and internal injuries were likely." 
</P>
<P>
Just in case all six cameras filming the crash somehow missed the impact, 
another Acclaim was waiting on the set for him to try it a second time. 
</P>
<P>
And what if Richman -- who is single -- had chickened out? Well, even Chrysler 
Chairman Lee A. Iacocca, a longtime opponent of air bags who only recently 
became an air bag cheerleader, was considered at one time. 
</P>
<P>
"When he was first reviewing the concept for the commercial, he laughingly 
volunteered," said Joe Hickey, Chrysler's manager of corporate advertising. But 
Iacocca wasn't there for the filming of the ad, although he did send Richman a 
thank-you note. 
</P>
<P>
Richman has since received plenty of other correspondence. Several advertisers 
have asked him to ram cars into walls for them too. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm being called the Hollywood crash dummy," said Richman. He jokingly 
recalled what went through his mind moments before he hit the wall: "Is it too 
late to become a CPA?"
