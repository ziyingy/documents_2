El Camino (3-0, 2-0) football Coach John Featherstone says his team got one 
monkey off its back with last week's victory over Fullerton, the team that 
handed the Warriors their only loss last season. 
</P>
<P>
On Saturday, in a 7 p.m. Mission Conference game at El Camino, he plans to 
remove the other one: Golden West, a team the Warriors tied last year. 
</P>
<P>
"They're usually tough," Featherstone said. "They've given us fits in the 
past." 
</P>
<P>
The task will be difficult for Golden West (2-1, 2-0) this time. The top-ranked 
Warriors (No. 4 nationally) lead the Mission conference in offense (they 
average 404 yards), and their offensive line is extremely tough. 
</P>
<P>
Quarterback Frank Dolce has completed 53 of 91 passes for 785 yards and six 
touchdowns in El Camino's victories against Antelope Valley, Orange Coast and 
Fullerton. 
</P>
<P>
Golden West prefers to keep the ball on the ground. Running back Sean Chiatham 
leads the Rustlers with 54 rushes for 232 yards and three touchdowns. Sophomore 
quarterback Rip Slippo has completed 23 of 43 passes for 336 yards and three 
touchdowns. The Rustlers have conference wins over Southwestern and Pasadena 
City. 
</P>
<P>
No. 14 L.A. Southwest (3-0, 2-0) may tarnish its perfect record in Saturday's 
7:30 p.m. Western State Conference game at Bakersfield. The Cougars will have a 
difficult time with Bakersfield (2-0-1, 1-0-1), a strong offensive team that 
thrashed Harbor 56-0 last week. 
</P>
<P>
The Renegades, ranked No. 12 in the state, have two lethal quarterbacks in 
left-hander Mike Smith and Lance Geary. 
</P>
<P>
The Cougars possess the state's second-best defense, which limited L.A. Valley 
to 126 total yards in last week's 12-9 win. 
</P>
<P>
Craig Manigo will run Southwest's offense. The freshman quarterback passed for 
145 yards and one touchdown last week. He completed 36 of 64 passes for 490 
yards on six touchdowns for the season. 
</P>
<P>
Harbor's (1-2, 0-2) best hope for a conference victory will come in Saturday's 
7:30 p.m. WSC contest at L.A. Valley. 
</P>
<P>
A triumph would be therapeutic for the Seahawks, who have lost two in a row, 
including last week's 56-0 shutout by Bakersfield. 
</P>
<P>
Valley is 0-3 after losing to Southwest last week. The Monarchs have also 
fallen to Moorpark and Mt. San Antonio College.
