A group of Indian teen-agers got their first whiff of the academic big time 
this week. 
</P>
<P>
"It's a lot bigger than I expected," said Becky Flynn, 16, a Cheyenne Indian 
from Watanga, Okla., midway through a guided tour of the campus at Cal State 
Long Beach. 
</P>
<P>
When asked what surprised her the most about California, Corrine Maillelle, 15, 
a member of the Athabascan tribe of Alaska on her first trip outside that 
state, did not think too long. "Palm trees, stars in the summer and crickets," 
she replied, listing things which she said are never seen in the small village 
from which she comes. 
</P>
<P>
Flynn and Maillelle are among 30 American Indian high school students, from 
reservations throughout the United States, spending four weeks on campus this 
summer in an unusual program. Its immediate purpose, according to director Lee 
Francis, is to steer them toward careers in engineering and science, fields he 
says are woefully under-represented in tribal life. But more than that, he 
said, the experience will broaden their horizons. 
</P>
<P>
"Many students prefer their home environments," said Francis, himself a Laguna 
Pueblo/Teton Sioux and director of the university's Indian Studies program. 
"(This will give them) access to a major university." 
</P>
<P>
Paid for with a $45,000 grant from the John D. and Catherine T. MacArthur 
Foundation of New York and funds from the university, the program is sponsored 
by the American Indian Science and Engineering Society, a professional 
organization based in Colorado, which chose Cal State Long Beach from among 
dozens of campuses nationwide for the project. 
</P>
<P>
Although the grant pays for instruction, dormitory rooms and food, the students 
were responsible for their air fare to Long Beach. Chosen on the basis of 
academic performance and interest in science or engineering, they will receive 
five hours of instruction a day in computer science, engineering, algebra and 
calculus. In addition, Francis said, the students will go on field trips to 
area museums and amusement parks and will hear lectures from Indians who have 
succeeded in science or engineering-related fields. 
</P>
<P>
Project organizers hope that some of the students will pursue higher education 
and careers in those fields. Ultimately, they say, they would like as many as 
possible to return to their reservations and make contributions in such areas 
as building construction, water reclamation and land management. 
</P>
<P>
"We don't see a lot of role models," Francis said. "What we want to do here is 
translate all of this into a tribal context." 
</P>
<P>
As part of doing that, he said, the summer courses will emphasize such Indian 
contributions to engineering as the cliff dwellings of New Mexico and Arizona, 
precursors of modern-day condominiums; the early dome structures now favored by 
some environmentally conscious developers, and early irrigation systems that 
heavily influenced those built later. 
</P>
<P>
"The Indian emphasis is respect and understanding for the earth, our mother," 
Francis said. "(The question is how to) build on that tradition." 
</P>
<P>
Not all of the students intend to use their educations exclusively for the 
benefit of their tribes or reservations, however. 
</P>
<P>
Garek Murphy, a Sioux from Fort Yates, N.D., said he hopes to become a teacher 
somewhere other than on his reservation. "The kids on the reservation have a 
bad attitude," said Murphy, 16. "I wouldn't want to teach there." 
</P>
<P>
And Delford Johnson, 16, a Navajo from Chinle, Ariz., said he too will probably 
leave the reservation on which he was raised to find better opportunities. 
</P>
<P>
But some of the youngsters say they are committed to staying. 
</P>
<P>
James Couture, a Chippewa from Duluth, Minn., said he would like to become an 
electrical engineer, then return home to put his skills to good use. "Around my 
reservation not too many Indians graduate with degrees," Couture, 16, said. 
"They mostly take jobs to support families." 
</P>
<P>
And Maillelle, the Athabascan from Alaska, said she intends to become a nurse, 
then return to her home village to serve as an example to others of what is 
possible. 
</P>
<P>
"The place I live is remote, and they don't know a lot about the outside 
world," Maillelle said. "It would help them to know that I got out." 
</P>
