In the photograph accompanying Brian Peterson's worthy review of "Bernard Shaw 
on Photography" (Book Review, Dec. 31), Shaw is pointing his (Leica 35 mm 
camera) at a subject but, strangely, looking through the view finder with his 
left eye with the finger of his right hand on the shutter button. 
</P>
<P>
 This isn't quite normal unless Shaw's right eye is "better" than his right 
eye. 
</P>
<P>
Was Shaw left-handed and possibly posed this way to exhibit more of his face? 
Or was the picture "flipped" in printing?
