A former mathematics teacher at Willard Intermediate School has been charged 
with molesting two male students on campus, and police said Friday that he has 
reportedly fled the state to avoid prosecution. A federal arrest warrant was 
issued Wednesday, charging Enrique Solorzano Provence, 37, with felony unlawful 
flight to avoid prosecution, said Lt. Robert Helton of the Santa Ana Police 
Department, which investigated the alleged molestations. 
</P>
<P>
Provence, who allegedly fled the area April 3, was charged in an arrest warrant 
issued April 11 with two counts each of child molestation and child annoyance 
involving the students, Helton said Friday. 
</P>
<P>
Child molesting is a felony; child annoyance, a crime in which there is no 
actual skin contact, is a misdemeanor charge. "It's the type of case when an 
individual attempts to excite an individual (without) skin contact," Helton 
explained. 
</P>
<P>
Besides the two students, police are concerned about the welfare of a 
14-year-old Willard student whom Provence identified as his son. Investigators 
who checked the boy's Mexican birth certificate with officials in Mexico were 
told that no such record could be found. Helton said they are now uncertain of 
the boy's identity, and believe that Provence may have produced a bogus birth 
certificate. 
</P>
<P>
Provence and the youth referred to each other as son and father but police are 
concerned because of the nature of the charges. 
</P>
<P>
"There's some concern because of a discrepancy with the birth certificate," 
Helton said. "We're very concerned with identifying who he actually is. We're 
not positive that he is his son, so we're concerned for his well-being. 
</P>
<P>
"The information that we have uncovered has led us to believe that he may be in 
either Alberta, Canada, or Laredo, Tex.," Helton said. He would not elaborate. 
</P>
<P>
Provence, who taught math in both Spanish and English to seventh graders, is 
accused of twice molesting an 11-year-old student, and of two acts of child 
annoyance involving a 12-year-old student. 
</P>
<P>
All four incidents allegedly occurred during school hours on the campus at 1342 
N. Ross St., Helton said. The boys told investigators that the encounters 
occurred during the 1989 holiday season. 
</P>
<P>
One of the victims spoke in March to a school counselor, who then contacted the 
Orange County Child Abuse Registry. The Santa Ana Unified School District 
placed Provence on administrative leave while police began an investigation 
into the charges. 
</P>
<P>
Helton said 60 students of Provence were interviewed by police investigators, 
and that two more boys came forward, claiming they had sexual encounters with 
the teacher. 
</P>
<P>
Before he disappeared, Helton added, Provence was "very distraught" during the 
investigation. 
</P>
<P>
District spokeswoman Diane Thomas said Provence had worked at the school less 
than a year, and taught no other subjects besides math. She said he was 
involved in a program called family math, in which parents are invited to join 
their children at the school for math classes. 
</P>
<P>
"We are aware that a warrant is out for his arrest," Thomas added. "It is our 
policy not to comment further when a matter is under police investigation." 
</P>
<P>
A teacher at Willard, who asked to remain anonymous, said the faculty was aware 
of the investigation for months but was asked not to talk about it. Provence 
had been hired last September to teach math, the teacher said. 
</P>

Provence lived in a Durant Street apartment a block from the campus from 
January until late March, the manager of the Durant Court Apartments said 
Friday. He shared his $525-a-month studio apartment with a teen-age boy, 
possibly his son, said the manager, who asked not to be identified. 
</P>
<P>
Near the end of March, the manager said, a woman claiming to be a friend of the 
Provence family said Provence was in the hospital and she was at the apartment 
to pick up his son. The manager said the boy left willingly. Neither the boy 
nor Provence has been seen at the apartment since. 
</P>
<P>
Police described Provence as a Latino, 5 feet, 6 inches tall, 145 pounds with 
black hair, brown eyes and glasses. He drove a blue 1978 Mercury Marquis. 
</P>
<P>
A detective has been assigned full time to the case and Santa Ana police have 
sought the help of Texas and Canadian authorities, alerting them to the arrest 
warrants. The warrant charging Provence with child molestation and annoyance 
carries a $100,000 bail.
