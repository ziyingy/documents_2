The Orange County district attorney's office Wednesday filed two second-degree 
murder charges against a man suspected of drunk driving who allegedly struck 
four pedestrians, killing two, when he accelerated through a crowded crosswalk 
last week. 
</P>
<P>
Authorities also said the suspect, Ciriaco Mendoza, 46, of Costa Mesa, was 
involved in a hit-and-run accident about two hours before the April 9 incident. 
</P>
<P>
Mendoza will be arraigned April 27 on two murder charges, two felony counts of 
driving under the influence of alcohol, a felony count of hit-and-run driving 
and a misdemeanor count of hit-and-run driving. 
</P>
<P>
The misdemeanor count involved the earlier hit-and-run incident in which 
Mendoza allegedly hit a Pacific Bell van near the intersection of Anaheim and 
Superior avenues. 
</P>
<P>
Lt. Alan Kent said the van's driver, Kenneth Melendres of Huntington Beach 
identified Mendoza in a photo lineup as the man who drove away after his 
company van was hit broadside. 
</P>
<P>
Melendres told police that Mendoza's Pontiac drove on the wrong side of the 
road, ran a stop sign and crashed into his van before continuing on Superior 
Avenue, Kent said. 
</P>
<P>
About two hours later, Mendoza allegedly plowed into four pedestrians in the 
crosswalk. Officers, who said they found several empty beer cans in Mendoza's 
car, initially arrested him on suspicion of felony drunk driving and 
hit-and-run. His blood-alcohol level was reported at 0.19%, more than twice the 
legal limit of 0.08%. 
</P>
<P>
However, Deputy Dist. Atty. Jim Marion said he decided to upgrade the charges 
after one victim, Luis Payno Rodriguez, 24, died at Mission Hospital Regional 
Medical Center in Mission Viejo on April 11. On Sunday, Rodriguez's friend, 
Oscar Zacaria Arellanos, 35, died at Western Medical Center-Santa Ana. 
</P>
<P>
Marion said the murder charges are supported by the evidence that investigators 
have uncovered. 
</P>
<P>
"This is more than just a DUI," Marion said. "Because of the earlier 
hit-and-run . . . we thought the facts warranted filing of murder charges. 
There is evidence to show wanton disregard for the safety of others."
