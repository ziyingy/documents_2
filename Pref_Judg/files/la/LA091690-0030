In all too many cases we have a drug policy being set by individuals with 
limited expertise in the field of alcoholism and other drug addictions.

Chief Gates and many others would be surprised to learn that our patients are 
ordinary people (doctors, lawyers, teachers, nurses, etc.) whose lives have 
become unmanageable due to their dependence on alcohol and other drugs. The 
focus and benefit of treatment is to provide an opportunity for these 
individuals and their families to recover from chemical dependency and to 
repair the damage done to their lives. These individuals have the right to 
proper care and treatment.
