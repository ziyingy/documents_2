A man who lost his family in the worst alcohol-related road accident in U.S. 
history said in court Wednesday that he wants an apology from the driver who is 
being tried on 27 counts of murder. 
</P>
<P>
"I want to know if he's hurting as bad as I am," Lee Williams said of the 
defendant, Larry Mahoney. "I want him to tell me he's sorry. This is the second 
Christmas I've spent without my daughters." 
</P>
<P>
Williams' wife, Joy, and daughters Kristin and Robin died in the fiery 
collision between Mahoney's pickup truck and a church bus in Carrollton on May 
14, 1988. Williams has since married the bus driver's widow.

Mahoney, 36, a chemical plant worker from Worthville, is charged with 27 counts 
of murder and 55 lesser offenses. He faces life imprisonment if convicted in 
the trial, which began Nov. 8 in Carroll County Circuit Court.

Williams was the last of 24 survivors of 26 of those killed to be called to the 
stand by Assistant Atty. Gen. Paul Richwalsky, special prosecutor in the case.

Williams, who had to pause several times during his testimony to regain his 
composure, said that a life sentence was the least punishment Mahoney should 
receive. 
</P>
<P>
"What we want is for Mr. Mahoney to go to prison and stay there for the rest of 
his natural life," said Williams, who has been the unofficial spokesman for 
several families who lost relatives in the collision. 
</P>

Mary Taylor, the nurse in charge of the emergency room at a hospital in 
Louisville to which Mahoney was taken after the accident, testified Wednesday 
that he had been unconscious and was suffering from a collapsed lung when he 
arrived. 
</P>
<P>
Analyses of whole blood and blood serum taken from Mahoney found alcohol levels 
of 0.18 and 0.24. Kentucky law defines intoxication as 0.10 or more. 
</P>
<P>
Other witnesses had testified that the pickup Mahoney was driving hit the bus, 
which was loaded with 67 people, and then another car when traveling the wrong 
way on Interstate 71.
