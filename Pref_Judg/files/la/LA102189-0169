In November, days will become shorter and cooler, but don't be fooled. It can 
be very dry during this time of the year, and regular watering remains a very 
important part of any gardening schedule, especially when Santa Ana winds 
appear. 
</P>
<P>
Keep those fall and winter annuals you have planted -- such as Iceland poppies, 
pansies and primroses -- healthy by feeding with a balanced liquid fertilizer 
every two weeks. 
</P>

As the cool months of winter are approaching, the ideal growing season for 
cyclamen begins. A member of the primrose family, cyclamen flower colors 
include white, pink, rose, red and purple. To dress up a patio or garden entry, 
plant several small potted cyclamens, four to six inches in size, into a larger 
bowl or container for a very effective splash of color. When transplanting use 
a rich, well-drained soil, but take care not to cover the crown of the tuber as 
this will cause the leaf and flower shoots to rot. 
</P>
<P>
Cyclamens develop a tuber much like the tuberous begonia, and they prefer a 
cool, bright filtered-light location. Once these plants are well established, 
feed every two to three weeks with a balanced fertilizer.

. . . AND GENERAL NOVEMBER CARE TIPS 
</P>
<P>
Stop feeding garden roses now since they're getting ready for their dormant 
winter period. 
</P>
<P>
Left to decay on your lawn or flower bed, fallen leaves are a haven for all 
sorts of pests and diseases. 
</P>
<P>
Don't forget to plant Dutch iris this month for a show of spring flowers. 
</P>
<P>
Plant Iceland poppies now to bring colorful blooms to the winter garden or as 
cut flowers indoors. 
</P>
<P>
Cut back or eliminate fertilizer for your houseplants and give them a rest for 
the winter. As active growth slows, take care not to overwater. 
</P>
<P>
If your bulb plants are turning yellow, cut them back and dig them for storage 
or be sure they are mulched well enough to keep them from freezing or being 
drowned -- assuming, of course, we have rain again. 
</P>
<P>
Now is an excellent time to plant new trees, shrubs and lawns. Lawns that 
should be overseeded can be worked now or, with an added feeding, you might be 
able to maintain the lawn longer. 
</P>
<P>
It's even the right time of year to seed the wildflowers in the areas where you 
want a show of spring color. Check with your local professional garden center 
and find out more about wild flowers that can naturalize. 
</P>
<P>
Take care with chrysanthemums -- dust for pests, stake for support, discontinue 
pinching out the tips, but start to disbud to get larger flowers. 
</P>
<P>
Consider raising flower beds to provide better drainage for your plants this 
winter. Use materials such as railroad ties and brick and add three or four 
inches of soil. 
</P>
<P>
There's still time to plant a berried shrub or two; choose from Christmas 
berry, holly and various pyracanthas. 
</P>
<P>
Houseplants need less water as the days get shorter and skies grow dimmer, 
especially those in plastic pots (which don't "breathe" like clay pots); keep 
an eye on those nearest the fireplace or heater.
