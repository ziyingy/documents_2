Brazil's President Jose Sarney announced a plan to protect the Amazon rain 
forest and castigated those who accuse Brazil of destroying the world's largest 
wilderness. Features of the plan include the creation of a national fund for 
environmental protection, suspension of subsidies for cattle ranchers in the 
Amazon Basin and new controls on pesticides. The government said the program, 
called "Our Nature," will have a budget of $178 million in its first year. "We 
are accused of something we cannot accept -- of destroying our own territory," 
Sarney said. "Our priority is the conservation of our ecological heritage."
