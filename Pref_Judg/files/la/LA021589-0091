One key scientist has died and several others have retired while waiting for 
the often-delayed Galileo spacecraft to blast off for Jupiter, but success 
moved a little closer Tuesday when a probe that will dash through the Jovian 
atmosphere was packaged for a trip across town. 
</P>
<P>
It was a small step perhaps. But for the men and women who have grown gray and 
weary while waiting for their mission to get off the ground, any progress is to 
be cherished. 
</P>
<P>
Built by the Space and Communications Group of Hughes Aircraft Co., the small 
probe is to be trucked today from El Segundo to the Jet Propulsion Laboratory 
near Pasadena. The probe will be carried to Jupiter aboard JPL's Galileo 
spacecraft. 
</P>
<P>
Sometime between Oct. 12 and Nov. 21, Galileo is scheduled to be carried to low 
Earth orbit by the space shuttle. Originally, the craft was to use powerful 
liquid fueled rockets to blast itself from Earth orbit to Jupiter, but 
heightened safety concerns over cargo carried aboard the shuttle compelled the 
National Aeronautics and Space Administration to switch to less powerful -- but 
safer -- solid rockets. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
A Tortured Route 
</P>
<P>
That means Galileo will have to follow a tortured route, flying first to Venus 
and using the gravity of Venus to pick up speed and fling it back toward Earth. 
Then it will fly past Earth twice, using the Earth's gravity to boost its speed 
more, finally sending it on toward the distant planet. 
</P>
<P>
The trip will be more than 2.4 billion miles, and the craft will not reach 
Jupiter until December of 1995. But for a lot of scientists who have feared 
many times over the last few years that the entire project was going to be 
scrapped, 1995 is better than nothing. 
</P>
<P>
Technical and scheduling problems had already delayed the project a couple of 
years even before the space shuttle Challenger exploded, delaying it even 
further. 
</P>
<P>
The wisdom of proceeding with the mission has been questioned by NASA 
executives "at least once every year," said Joel Sperans, chief of the space 
exploration project for NASA's Ames Research Center. "We've had a lot of 
challenges, but they are behind us. I'm confident we will make it now." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Hasn't Been Easy 
</P>
<P>
But for many who have devoted considerable portions of their careers to the 
project, it has not been easy. 
</P>
<P>
"There has been a lot of wear and tear on the bodies as well as the hardware," 
said Benny Chin, program manager for Ames. 
</P>
<P>
Robert Boese, principal investigator for one of the probe's six instruments, 
died in December of 1986. Other scientists have retired, and many others just 
drifted away to other agencies after growing weary over the seemingly endless 
delays. 
</P>
<P>
"It's been a very long program," said John Radecki, program manager at Hughes. 
</P>
<P>
During the lengthy delays, the mission has been "reprogrammed" six times. But 
if successful, the $1.36-billion mission will give scientists their first look 
at an asteroid, and it will tell much about the giant, gaseous planet known as 
Jupiter. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Two Main Parts 
</P>
<P>
Galileo consists primarily of two parts: Ames Research Center's atmospheric 
probe, which will plunge into the Jovian atmosphere at 107,000 miles an hour, 
and JPL's mother ship, which will orbit the planet for about 20 months, sending 
back data for that entire period. 
</P>
<P>
"It's a scientifically rich mission," said Richard Spehalski of JPL, who is the 
overall project manager. 
</P>
<P>
About 150 days before Galileo reaches the planet, the 4-foot-diameter 
atmospheric probe will separate from the main spacecraft. As the probe rips 
through the planet's atmosphere at that speed, it will slow down so quickly 
that "deceleration" forces will be equal to 350 times that of the gravitational 
pull of Earth. That will have the effect of making the 745-pound probe weigh as 
much as a DC-10 jetliner. 
</P>
<P>
For 75 minutes, the probe will plunge into Jupiter's atmosphere. Sometime after 
passing through the first layers of clouds, the probe will be crushed by the 
dense atmosphere. 
</P>
<P>
But before that happens, it will have sent back enormous amounts of data, 
scientists hope. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
To Make 10 Orbits 
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the "mother ship" will continue to study the planet and its four 
moons, making 10 orbits of the giant planet and sending back about 50,000 
pictures. 
</P>
<P>
There is, however, at least one other significant hurdle to overcome. Like all 
deep space probes, Galileo will use radioisotopes to generate the electricity 
it will need to run its instruments. And since it requires White House approval 
to launch any spacecraft with radioactive materials aboard, the mission must 
now undergo intensive review by several federal agencies before the President's 
approval for launch can even be requested. 
</P>
<P>
Spehalski, the project director, said he expects that approval to be granted in 
September -- the month before the scheduled launch.
