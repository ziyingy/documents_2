Remus and Romulus founded Rome. And, now, Silvana and Stefania Maisano, Italy's 
latest set of creative twins, have found Beverly Hills. 
</P>
<P>
But the Genoese-born sculptors encountered problems -- in fact, a couple of 
them -- trying to install their works in a new complex called Two Rodeo Drive. 
</P>
<P>
A fountain designed by Silvana flooded Friday (fortunately for the twins, the 
Drought Police weren't in the neighborhood). 
</P>
<P>
And a pillar designed by Stefania -- the twins usually work on separate art 
pieces -- is being detained by U.S. Customs because the paperwork isn't 
complete. (Oddly enough, a second pillar sailed through.) 
</P>
<P>
"They're pretty mad," said publicist Alex Auerbach, "particularly about the 
pillar. They can't understand why there's no way to lubricate the Customs 
process with a few dollars."

Only in L.A. Menu Item of the Week: "California-Mexican roll" at La Cocina 
restaurant in Signal Hill. It's a tortilla filled with chicken, tomato and 
cheese, then cut and wrapped with lettuce to look like sushi.

"Cop Rock," TV's police musical, is being touted as a revolutionary idea. But 
it's the same old song for the L.A. County Sheriff's Department. 
</P>
<P>
The only difference is that the sheriff's deputies who perform in the group 
Manhunter don't sing at work, like the stars of "Cop Rock." 
</P>
<P>
With a repertoire that includes such cop-oriented original tunes as "It's a 
Mystery" and "Driving Fast," Manhunter has played at the Crazy Horse in Santa 
Ana as well as at several anti-drug telethons and benefits. 
</P>
<P>
Because of the nature of show biz and cop biz, Manhunter's cast has undergone 
changes. 
</P>
<P>
Guitarist Van Mosley plans to work on his own album. David Leicht, a former 
member, is now a deputy in San Bernardino. 
</P>
<P>
Leicht wrote "Driving Fast," the story of a wild police pursuit narrated by the 
cop riding shotgun: 
</P>
<P>
"Had my feet on the dash and we were haulin'," it begins. 
</P>
<P>
Manhunter plays various styles of music, but "'Driving Fast,"' said Leicht, "is 
definitely rock." 
</P>

Now that Disneyland has changed its mind about replacing its robotic Abe 
Lincoln with Kermit the Frog at a park exhibit, the question remains: Where to 
put the loquacious Muppet? 
</P>
<P>
May we suggest a troubled Disney-operated attraction with a more fitting name. 
How about making Kermit the Frog the host of the Spruce Goose? There'd even be 
room inside for Miss Piggy. 
</P>

L.A. may be the only U.S. city to have a Beethoven Market. It stocks no 
T-shirts or items honoring the composer, though. It's a Mar Vista grocery store 
on Beethoven Street.
