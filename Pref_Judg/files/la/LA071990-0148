On an immense, dusty pasture about seven miles north of Merced, community 
activist Bob Carpenter envisions classrooms, dormitories, a library and a gym.

Along the gently sloping foothills between Fresno and the snow-capped Sierra, a

Big dreams all, and doable with enough money and foresight, contend those 
dreamers and others throughout eight San Joaquin Valley counties. But the rub 
is that only one such vision can come true. 
</P>
<P>
The farm-based communities are pitted against each other in a lively 
competition to be the next host city for a University of California campus and 
all the jobs, big bucks and prestige UC brings. Governments and volunteer 
groups are engaged in rival campaigns of boosterism and are dangling amazingly 
large plots of free or cheap land before the UC Regents, who are to announce 
Friday a list of eight to 10 semifinalists from about 70 possible land tracts. 
</P>
<P>
San Joaquin Valley interest in the school is so strong that Mark Aydelotte, 
UC's area representative in Fresno, said he was tailed after a recent community 
meeting by other drivers apparently hoping his route home would provide clues 
to the site decision. 
</P>
<P>
"People have only one question for me: 'Where is the new campus going to go?' " 
said Aydelotte, who insists he does not know. 
</P>
<P>
That a city would want a UC campus is not surprising. Such a campus can pump 
millions of dollars into the local economy, spin off high-tech industries from 
laboratory research and give residents better access to higher education. It 
also can put a town on the nation's intellectual map. After all, how many Ivy 
League scholars ever heard of Santa Cruz or Irvine before the initials "UC" 
appeared in front of those names? 
</P>
<P>
"There is a competition, but there hasn't been any kind of nastiness or 
negativeness associated with it," former Fresno Mayor Dan Whitehurst said. "But 
things might change when we get down to 10 specific sites." 
</P>
<P>
In advance of Friday's announcement, UC officials would only say the search is 
focused on eight counties: Tulare, Fresno, Madera, Merced, Mariposa, 
Stanislaus, San Joaquin and Tuolumne. The list of eight to 10 semifinalist 
sites, detailed down to crossroads and acreage, will be reduced to three 
finalists in November. A winner is to be chosen a year later after 
environmental impact studies are reviewed. 
</P>
<P>
Over the past few months, a dozen committees from places such as Los Banos, 
Modesto, Madera, Manteca and Hanford have besieged UC officials with reports, 
brochures, videotapes, T-shirts and telephone calls touting locations. 
Aydelotte sometimes is concerned that the reality of a campus can never match 
expectations that a UC "will mean a new renaissance, a new day, a solution to 
all sorts of problems." 
</P>
<P>
To be sure, there is opposition from farmers worried about pollution and the 
loss of agricultural land. UC says it wants between 1,500 and 2,000 acres away 
from the better soils of California's food-producing heartland. 
</P>
<P>
Others are concerned about the social and political effects an army of students 
could have on quiet, conservative farming communities. At a meeting in Sonora, 
an elderly gentleman angrily asked whether the main education at a UC is in 
"drugs and kinky sex," Aydelotte laughingly recalled. 
</P>
<P>
Still, most people in the region were delighted when the regents decided in 
February that the first of three new campuses to accommodate a projected 
enrollment boom should be built in the San Joaquin Valley by 1998. The two 
others might follow in the northern and southern parts of the state. The last 
major UC expansion was in the mid-1960s with the openings of the San Diego, 
Santa Cruz and Irvine campuses, and the valley has felt snubbed since. 
</P>
<P>
Partly because none of the nine UC campuses are in the valley, high school 
graduates from the area attend UC at a rate half the statewide average. And the 
population of the valley, from Calaveras County south to Kern County, is 2.6 
million and is expected to grow faster than that of any region in the state 
over the next 10 years, fueled by refugees from high housing prices elsewhere 
in California and from economic and political troubles in Asia, Latin America 
and Armenia. 
</P>
<P>
The valley is still dominated by agribusiness and family orchards. But the 
two-story homes and shopping malls blossoming on what were cotton fields a year 
ago suggest that the bucolic isolation is eroding. Long commutes to jobs in the 
San Francisco Bay Area are becoming more common, and white-collar employment in 
the valley itself is increasing faster than jobs in farming. Some people talk 
fearfully of "Los Angelization." Others say changes are inevitable and a UC 
campus with high-tech research as well as agricultural science courses would 
provide the education to cope with such change. 
</P>
<P>
"Sure we need the school," farmer Fred Giorgetti said at his produce stand in 
Centerville, about 20 miles east of Fresno and next to one of the possible 
sites in the foothills. Twelve ears of corn were selling for $1.50, and French 
tourists en route to Sequoia National Park were buying up nectarines and 
walnuts in apparent delight at the low prices. 
</P>
<P>
"Berlin is going to be the capital of Europe, Tokyo is going to be the capital 
of Asia, and if we don't get some educated people, we are going to be the 
capital of dope dealers," Giorgetti continued, saying he would be willing to 
sell the farm that has been in his family for 85 years. 
</P>
<P>
The cultural life and prestige of any town that became a UC town presumably 
would increase. "Whether it's condoms for cows or tiny robot bugs to eat grape 
leaf skeletonizers . . ., surely some absent-minded professor will stumble onto 
a world-class discovery and get us all on 'Good Morning America,' " Fresno Bee 
newspaper columnist Jim Wasserman joked. 
</P>
<P>
The new UC would start with 1,000 students and possibly grow over 25 years to 
as many as 25,000. That would require a faculty of about 1,400 and a 
non-teaching staff of about 9,000. In a region where unemployment runs as high 
as 15%, it would also mean thousands of new jobs serving hamburgers, selling 
houses and renting movies to UC students, workers and families. Student 
spending alone would eventually inject an estimated $5 million a year into the 
local economy. 
</P>
<P>
"The community needs it as an economic engine," explained Carpenter, the 
insurance agent who heads the UC Merced Campus Committee. Merced, in the 
northern part of the region, has 55,000 people, a lot of dairy farms and 
increasing amounts of light manufacturing. 
</P>
<P>
In addition, there is little doubt that the value of land near a campus would 
increase sharply. (That became a sore point after reports that relatives of UC 
Regent Leo Kolligian had purchased land near a possible campus site in Merced. 
Kolligian denied that the purchase had anything to do with the campus study, 
but the university subsequently asked 200 of its officials to reveal any land 
holdings in region.) 
</P>
<P>
The Merced group is pushing range land next to Lake Yosemite, an artificial 
lake popular with boaters. The land, with fine views of the Sierra Nevada, is 
part of 7,000 acres donated to the local board of education. Merced officials 
think their plan -- to give 2,000 acres to UC and sell off the rest to 
developers -- is so sure-fire that they already have scheduled a community 
picnic Sunday to celebrate being named one of the semifinalists. 
</P>
<P>
Other places are offering free land, too. But since the prices range from 
$2,000 to $12,000 an acre, land would be a relatively small cost compared to 
the estimated $300 million needed to build the campus. 
</P>
<P>
So communities are trying to show how much they match other UC requirements: 
not more than 30 miles from a population center of 50,000; proximity to an 
airport and major highways; solid infrastructure; job possibilities for spouses 
of faculty; cultural and recreational opportunities; plentiful and inexpensive 
housing; visual beauty. 
</P>
<P>
Backers contend that 29 possible sites in Fresno County fit the bill. Fresno 
County (population 625,000) is presenting a united front in claiming to be the 
capital of the region. Where else are there so many hospitals, courthouses, 
museums, shopping centers, television stations, airplane routes, different 
ethnic groups and varied places of worship? 
</P>
<P>
"It's obvious that any community that gets the campus would benefit from a 
selfish viewpoint, but by choosing a Fresno (County) site, UC can fulfill its 
own mission a lot easier," said banker Lutz, a Fresno leader in UC wooing. 
</P>
<P>
Rivals carp that Fresno already has a California State University campus. But 
supporters point out that UC offers doctorates and stresses research, while the 
Cal State system offers only bachelor's and master's degrees and stresses 
undergraduate education. UC also let it be known that any new campus will not 
have much of an athletic program compared to the rabidly popular sports teams 
at Fresno State. 
</P>
<P>
Other possible sites include parts of the nearly 10,100-acre Mapes Ranch west 
of Modesto; a large tract on the eastern edge of Lake Madera; another near Los 
Banos between San Luis Dam and California 140; and three perfectly flat tracts 
of cotton fields very close to California 99 within a few miles of Visalia, a 
city of 77,000 between Bakersfield and Fresno. 
</P>
<P>
The campaign for a UC Visalia pitches a self-proclaimed pleasant lifestyle, 
beautiful trees, homes for under $100,000 and an old-fashioned downtown that 
could accommodate student cafes and bookstores. 
</P>
<P>
Just as important, local officials say, is meeting the UC demand that there be 
no significant public opposition. UC does not want a valley duplication of 
town-gown friction in Santa Cruz and Santa Barbara over housing, traffic, water 
and politics. 
</P>
<P>
"Our expectation is that they will be selecting us not just because Visalia is 
a good area. But they'll be selecting us because 30 years from now we will 
still be enjoying a good relationship with UC," said Ramsey, Visalia's director 
of research and development. 
</P>
<P>
Attempting to prove goodwill, UC boosters in the valley lobbied hard and 
successfully for a decent margin of approval in last month's vote on 
Proposition 111, the state tax and spending changes that make campus 
construction possible. 
</P>
<P>
On the other hand, a survey by the Tulare County Farm Bureau, which includes 
Visalia, found that while 60% of its members who responded want a UC campus in 
the area, 40% oppose it. Laurena Johnson, bureau executive director, said 
farmers worry about population growth, water shortages and air pollution. 
"While there is a lot of support for the campus, there is that other faction 
that says, 'Hey, if we don't make a stand now, our county is going to be so 
overrun with people,' " Johnson explained. 
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, UC representative Aydelotte doesn't want people to lose sight of the 
real beneficiaries of a new campus. "Sometimes you get a question from a 10- or 
an 11-year-old and you realize this kid could be a freshman class member when 
this campus opens," he said. "It gives you pause." 
</P>
