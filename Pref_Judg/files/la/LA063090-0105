When Andrea Gurka saw the wall of flames racing up Old San Marcos Pass Road 
Wednesday evening, quickly approaching her home, she placed a frantic phone 
call to her husband at work. She was stuck without a car and didn't know what 
to do. 
</P>
<P>
That's the last anyone heard from Gurka. The 37-year-old woman fled her home on 
foot, apparently trying to outrun the violent blaze that would consume her home 
and hundreds of others along the winding mountain canyon, fire officials said. 
</P>
<P>
Gurka made it to the the dry creek bed that runs behind her home, but no 
farther. A search-and-rescue team found her body there Friday morning, after 
her husband reported her missing.

For all the massive destruction wrought by fire across Southern California this 
week, there have been only two deaths. The other came Thursday in Riverside 
County. 
</P>
<P>
Victor Ferrera, 23, of San Diego, an inmate from a Department of Corrections 
camp, was among a 17-member crew overrun by flames Wednesday afternoon near 
Hemet when a whirling wind suddenly shifted the brush fire they were fighting. 
Ferrera died of his injuries the next day. 
</P>
<P>
The young man, one of seven children of a San Diego metal worker and his wife, 
had been in minor trouble with the law over drugs since he was a kid, a 
Department of Corrections official said. He was serving his first long-term 
sentence, at the Bautista Conservation Camp in Hemet, this time for an armed 
robbery while high on drugs. 
</P>
<P>
Counselors at the camp said he was a well-behaved and "kind of quiet guy," the 
spokesman said. 
</P>

Ironically, smaller fires have frequently resulted in higher death tolls. For 
instance, the 1985 Baldwin Hills fire in Los Angeles, which destroyed 48 homes, 
killed three people. Ten people died in the 1970 fire that raged from Newhall 
to Malibu, destroying more than 400 homes. 
</P>
<P>
Fire officials attribute the low death toll in this year's fires, which 
consumed thousands of acres and more than 500 homes, to a combination of 
improved training, public education, interagency coordination -- and luck. 
</P>
<P>
"You have the best of your training and you put it into effect when emergencies 
like this come up -- sometimes you're fortunate and other times you're not," 
said Cindy Webster, a spokeswoman for the U.S. Forest Service and Santa Barbara 
County public agencies. "This time, our investment paid off and we're 
grateful." 
</P>
<P>
Training in recent years among fire-fighting agencies, including those serving 
Glendale and Santa Barbara -- two of the hardest-hit areas in this week's fires 
-- has increasingly focused on safety, officials said. 
</P>
<P>
"We stress safety more now than we did perhaps 10 years ago," said Capt. Al 
Kepler, a spokesman for the Glendale Fire Department. City firefighters are 
subjected to more intense and longer training, which continues even after 
firefighters are on the job, he said. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm not surprised by the low death toll, not with the training we're given," 
he added. 
</P>
<P>
Firefighters often are shown pictures and videotapes of fires where something 
went wrong and tragedy resulted, Webster said. 
</P>
<P>
"The training is very realistic, even grim," she said. "We see the mistakes 
that people have made that have gotten them killed, and we learn from them." 
</P>
<P>
Webster added that interagency emergency planning efforts have also helped in 
reducing the chaos that can lead to injury or death. Various agencies, 
including state forestry, county and city fire protection departments, have 
also stepped up public safety campaigns in recent years in the Santa Barbara 
area, she said. Residents have been bombarded with leaflets, radio public 
service announcements and presentations at homeowners' association meetings, 
she added. 
</P>
<P>
"It's really made a difference," she said. 
</P>
<P>
Still, given the severity of the wind-swept fires that destroyed entire 
neighborhoods in the Santa Barbara area, Webster said "it's amazing" that more 
people weren't killed in the blaze. 
</P>
<P>
In Glendale, where a fast-moving blaze destroyed 46 homes before the fire was 
brought under control Wednesday night, officials were grateful that the fire 
began during daylight hours and that it occurred in an area with easy access to 
fire equipment and for the evacuation of residents. 
</P>
<P>
"The potential for injury is much greater in the dark and when people may be 
sleeping," said Kepler, adding: "I guess luck explains the low injury rate as 
well as anything." 
</P>
<P>
Hernandez reported from Los Angeles and Dunn from Santa Barbara.
