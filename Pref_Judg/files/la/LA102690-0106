Small business owners have a hard enough time getting customers in the door. 
But the merchants of West Washington Boulevard in Venice had an even tougher 
time because there are several other Washington streets or boulevards around 
Los Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
"I'd given directions to enough people through the years to be very 
frustrated," said Carol Tantau Smith, who has been selling jewelry and gift 
items on the boulevard for about eight years. 
</P>
<P>
Two years ago, Tantau Smith helped spearhead a successful drive to rename the 
street Abbot Kinney Boulevard, in honor of the wealthy landowner who founded 
Venice and built canals resembling their Italian counterparts in the early 
1900s. 
</P>
<P>
The name change was the catalyst for an overall effort by business people to 
spruce up the district in hopes of boosting business. 
</P>
<P>
Changing the character of your neighborhood isn't easy, but business owners 
nationwide are teaming up to rub out graffiti, clear trash from vacant lots and 
brighten their surroundings. 
</P>
<P>
Every dollar invested in fixing up your business district can generate up to 
$17 in additional income, according to Matt Hussman, a program associate for 
the National Trust for Historic Preservation in Washington. Over the past 10 
years, the Trust's Main Street Center has helped 661 communities from Boston to 
Hollister, Calif., revitalize their commercial streets. 
</P>
<P>
"The projects across the country have generated thousands of dollars and 
created thousands of jobs," said Hussman. 
</P>
<P>
Involving local residents who shop in your store is critical to insuring the 
success of any revitalization plan, according to Mark Futterman, director of 
urban design and planning for Urban Innovations Group in Westwood. He also 
recommended contacting local city planners and politicians to gain support. 
</P>
<P>
Futterman, who chairs the urban design committee for the Los Angeles chapter of 
the American Institute of Architects, said AIA chapters around the country can 
serve as resources for business owners seeking help. 
</P>
<P>
Redevelopment experts say what is happening along Abbot Kinney Boulevard is 
typical of revitalization projects elsewhere. Once the physical area is 
improved, rents go up and the caliber of businesses generally improves. 
</P>
<P>
Although the street is still tricky to find, the general feeling along Abbot 
Kinney Boulevard is that business is perking up. 
</P>
<P>
"It just feels different," said Tantau Smith. "There is a real energy." 
</P>
<P>
Within five short blocks, visitors can find a plumber, travel agency, grocery 
store, liquor store, barber and beauty shops, a kick-boxing school, several 
antique stores, a contemporary lighting gallery, a vintage clothing store, a 
myriad of art galleries and a millinery shop. 
</P>
<P>
Dozens of palm trees are due to be planted along the parkways to soften the 
harsh lines of many of the older brick and concrete buildings. 
</P>
<P>
"The quality of merchants is a clear cut above what we've had here before," 
said Richard Rosenthal, principal broker and real estate consultant for Richard 
Rosenthal and Associates. "The energy along the boulevard is created by the 
rehabilitation and new construction."

Sunya Currie, a jewelry designer and antique dealer, bought the old Elk's Club 
building at 1130 West Washington Blvd. in 1968. In the 1970s, she ran her 
antique business in the airy space. In 1981, when the boulevard's energy 
reached a low ebb, she moved to Beverly Hills. 
</P>
<P>
Currie returned to Abbot Kinney Boulevard in September, determined to be part 
of the renaissance. 
</P>
<P>
"I just had a feeling this area was ready to take off," said Currie. "There is 
a feeling of the original Venice here, with artists living and working in the 
same space." 
</P>
<P>
Lori Henle, a modern-day milliner who specializes in traditional techniques, 
said she is very busy with retail customers when she opens her door on Saturday 
and Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
She moved her studio to Abbot Kinney Boulevard in July and is about to move 
into an apartment behind her workshop. "Everybody on the street is really 
pulling together," said Henle, who worked as a fashion stylist before turning 
her skills to hat making. "I'm just happy to be down here."
