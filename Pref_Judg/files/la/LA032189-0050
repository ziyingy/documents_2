The Supreme Court, exposing a loophole in federal copyright law, said Monday 
that book publishers, composers, film makers and computer programmers may not 
go to court to charge state universities, public schools, libraries and other 
public agencies with illegally using their copyrighted works. 
</P>
<P>
The high court action, in denying an appeal from a computer software firm, 
could mean a loss of millions of dollars in fees for companies whose 
copyrighted products are used illegally by government agencies, copyright 
holders said. 
</P>
<P>
The justices left standing a ruling by the federal appeals court in California, 
which said that the Constitution forbids damage suits against states or state 
agencies unless Congress has specifically said otherwise. In the 1976 Copyright 
Act, Congress said that all damage suits for copyright infringements must go 
into federal courts -- not state courts -- but it said nothing about allowing 
states to be sued. 
</P>
<P>
The unintended result, said the appellate court, is to "allow states to violate 
the federal copyright laws with virtual immunity." 
</P>
<P>
The Assn. of American Publishers, the Information Industry Assn., the Music 
Publishers Assn. and the major Hollywood film corporations, among others, urged 
the high court to hear a test suit against UCLA and to overturn the appellate 
court ruling. But without comment, the appeal was denied (BV Engineering vs. 
UCLA, 88-1099). 
</P>
<P>
"The Supreme Court has allowed this (1976) law to be gutted," said Michael A. 
Ladra, a Palo Alto lawyer who represented BV Engineering, a computer software 
maker. "I guess they are saying it is up to Congress to change the law." 
</P>
<P>
In 1986, BV Engineering sued UCLA, contending that its professors had illegally 
copied seven of its computer programs. But Judge Harry L. Hupp dismissed the 
suit on grounds that UCLA, as an agency of the state, is immune from federal 
suits under the 11th Amendment. Last year, the U.S. 9th Circuit Court of 
Appeals in Pasadena affirmed that conclusion.

Possible Threat Cited 
</P>
<P>
These rulings "permit a state university to purchase one copy of a computer 
program and provide unlimited copies to each of its students," Ladra said in 
his brief to the court. "Such an outcome would be financially devastating to 
authors of copyrighted works and threatens the future of emerging intellectual 
property industries." 
</P>
<P>
The publishers and the film corporations complained in their briefs that state 
prisons, libraries, state hospitals and schools regularly violate the 1976 laws 
by illegally copying books or videos. 
</P>
<P>
University lawyers deny that copyrighted materials are often misused. 
</P>
<P>
"There are no widespread abuses of the copyright law that we know of," said UC 
attorney George Marchand. UCLA professors, he added, thought it was legal to 
make some copies of the BV Engineering program and they immediately quit the 
copying program when the company objected.

In other actions, the court: 
</P>
<P>
* Let stand a federal appellate court ruling from California that forbids 
cities, school boards and counties to use at-large election districts if they 
have the effect of discriminating against minority candidates (Watsonville vs. 
Gomez, 88-1236). 
</P>
<P>
The 9th Circuit Court of Appeals, in a suit by the Mexican American Legal 
Defense and Educational Fund against the city of Watsonville, said that 
Watsonville discriminated against Latinos by electing its seven-member city 
council through citywide elections rather than through districts. 
</P>
<P>
Attorney Joaquin Avila of Fremont, who won the case in the appeals court, said 
that the outcome may force many California localities to switch to district 
elections. 
</P>
<P>
* Agreed to let an attorney for the Bush Administration join the April 26 oral 
argument in a Missouri abortion case (Webster vs. Reproductive Health Services, 
88-605). Lawyers for Missouri are seeking to revive their state law prohibiting 
the use of public facilities or employees for assisting in abortion. The 
Administration is seeking a much broader ruling that would overturn the 1973 
Roe vs. Wade decision that made abortion legal. 
</P>
<P>
* Turned down an appeal from "Freeway Killer" William Bonin, who was convicted 
of murdering 14 young men in Los Angeles and Orange counties in 1979 and 1980. 
Bonin, who is now on Death Row at San Quentin, contended that the instructions 
given to his jury were unfair. 
</P>
<P>
On a 7-2 vote, the justices dismissed the appeal (Bonin vs. California, 
88-6341) without comment. Justices William J. Brennan Jr. and Thurgood Marshall 
routinely dissent in all death penalty cases in the belief that capital 
punishment is barred by the 8th Amendment. A public defender in Los Angeles 
says that he expects to file further appeals on Bonin's behalf. 
</P>
<P>
* Agreed to decide whether the Constitution's protection of religious freedom 
forbids a state to fire a drug counselor who ate an illegal hallucinogenic drug 
as part of a religious service. The case concerns two American Indians who were 
fired from their jobs and denied unemployment benefits after they used peyote 
at a religious ceremony (Employment Division vs. Smith, 88-1213). 
</P>
<P>
* Allowed the partial merger of Detroit's two newspapers to proceed (Michigan 
Citizens for an Independent Press vs. Thornburgh, A-695). Former Atty. Gen. 
Edwin Meese III authorized the merger of the business operations on the grounds 
that either the Detroit Free Press and the Detroit News would fail without 
relief. A group of advertisers, employees and readers urged the court to block 
the merger, but their request was denied.
