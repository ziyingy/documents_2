An outbreak of legionnaire's disease at a 50th high school reunion was blamed 
Thursday for the deaths of three elderly celebrants and the pneumonia-like 
illness of 13 others. 
</P>
<P>
State health officials contacted 250 other people from 21 states who attended 
the Lamar High School reunion for the classes of 1937 through 1941 but found no 
new cases, Dr. Ellen Mangione, a Colorado Department of Health epidemiologist, 
said. 
</P>
<P>
Since the disease has a four- to 10-day incubation period and the reunion was 
held in late September, Mangione said it is "not likely" that the outbreak will 
spread. 
</P>
<P>
Because of this, she said, the health department recommended but so far is not 
enforcing temporary closure of the hotel where the reunion was held. 
</P>
<P>
However, the owner of the Cow Palace Inn in Lamar, about 200 miles southeast of 
Denver, said the facility would close voluntarily on Monday, while a team of 
health investigators tests the hotel's ventilation, heating and water systems 
in an attempt to trace the bacteria which causes legionnaire's disease. 
</P>
<P>
State health officials are consulting with the federal Centers for Disease 
Control, and the CDC is assisting in testing. 
</P>
<P>
Health officials are also contacting 12 other groups which held conventions at 
the Cow Palace in September and early October. 
</P>
<P>
"There's a potential for continuing risk, but we feel it's relatively small," 
Mangione said. "We're reevaluating it hourly and it's possible that we'll tell 
them to close before Monday." 
</P>
<P>
One of the 13 surviving victims remained hospitalized Thursday. Although 
laboratory results are back on only one of the 16 cases, Mangione said it is 
"exceedingly likely that all the others are legionnaire's disease." 
</P>
<P>
Colorado has reported 37 individual cases of legionnaire's disease in the past 
five years but this is the first outbreak. Nationally, the disease is fatal in 
about 15% of the cases and can be effectively treated with antibiotics. 
Symptoms include high fever, headaches and loss of appetite. The disease is 
most common in men over 50, smokers and people in frail health. The Colorado 
victims were in their 70s and 80s.

<P>
The mayor of Lamar, Nancy Turner, told Denver's KUSA-TV Thursday night that "we 
don't think they caught it in Lamar . . . . They could have brought it with 
them. At least two of the people who were sick in Lamar had been very ill for 
several months." 
</P>
<P>
Mangione noted that there had been several outbreaks of legionnaire's disease 
across the country since the 1976 American Legion convention at the Bellevue 
Stratford Hotel in Philadelphia in which 34 died, and the current Colorado 
outbreak "isn't one of the biggest."
