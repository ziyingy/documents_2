AT&amp;T signed an agreement Monday to share a key ingredient used to make 
advanced semiconductors under the auspices of Sematech, the consortium of 
computer chip makers formed to boost U.S. semiconductor competitiveness. 
</P>
<P>
Under the agreement, American Telephone &amp; Telegraph Co. will allow a 
division of Olin Corp. to make and sell a chemical used to etch extremely 
detailed electronic circuitry on chips. 
</P>

The chemical, called "deep UV resist," allows chip designers to pack a greater 
number of circuits on chips than with current technologies. In making chips, 
circuitry is etched on silicon wafers using a light-sensitive chemical -- or 
resist -- and a "mask," whose function is similar to that of a negative in 
photography.

AT&amp;T Bell Laboratories of Murray Hill, N.J., has invented a version of the 
chemical that is used with ultraviolet light instead of the visible light now 
used. 
</P>
<P>
UV resist can produce highly complex computer chips with circuits as thin as 
0.3 micrometers, or about 400 times smaller than a human hair, AT&amp;T said.

Circuitry on most chips today is 1.0 to 1.2 microns wide; they reach 0.8 
microns in advanced chips.
