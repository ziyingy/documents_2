Question: I read with interest your suggestion to slit the side seams of a 
too-tight jacket from waist to hips the way some Paris designer has done. Would 
the same premise work for a too-tight skirt? I seem to remember reading that 
skirts with deep slits were out now. Can you set the record straight? -- P.L.P. 
</P>
<P>
Answer: Skirts with deep slits were indeed passe until fashion king Yves Saint 
Laurent decided to slit the skirts in his last haute couture collection. Now, 
not only is this look catching on with other designers, it has occasioned a 
whole new trend in panty hose -- namely, shimmery, iridescent legs for day. 
</P>
<P>
Saint Laurent's slits aren't always in the seam, but close enough for the 
comfort you seek. These deep slits presume, of course, that you have legs worth 
baring and a setting in which they're appropriate. 
</P>
<P>
While the Paris designer's leggy looks were shown for day, they will probably 
be reserved for evening by most consumers as they might well be too distracting 
for most offices and too revealing for most luncheon napkins.

Q: What shoes look best with the new folkloric clothes such as the choli 
blouses and ornate vests you've been writing about? -- T.U. 
</P>
<P>
A: Milan design guru Giorgio Armani shows his Nepal/India look with flat, 
sling-back sandals. Shoe queen Maud Frizon says her "turn toes" that curl back 
like Turkish slippers also are appropriate, adding that perhaps the most 
versatile shoe for all ethnic looks is that old favorite, the thong. Frizon's 
new thong-of-thongs is in black patent with raffia platforms.

Q: Please comment on the style of clothing best suited for the mature woman 
with osteoporosis. I have a feeling there are many of us with curving spines 
that make the tummies protrude. Which patterns would be best for petite women 
with such conditions? -- V.R.S. 
</P>
<P>
A: The shirring and/or gathers on dresses, jackets and tops with shoulder yokes 
are especially helpful in disguising dowager's hump and other figure problems 
caused by osteoporosis. 
</P>
<P>
Avoid dresses with waistlines, as the curvature of your spine will cause them 
to pull up, down or to one side. Smocks and smock-like jackets are especially 
becoming. 
</P>
<P>
Here are some patterns that will help compensate for your curving spine: 
McCall's 2718, 3770, 3511, 4100, 3921, 3963, 3487 and 4022.

In ready-made clothes, the spring catalogue published by Vicki Wayne's Old 
Pueblo Traders, Palo Verde at 34th St., Box 27800, Tucson, Ariz. 85726-7800, 
offers several styles ideal for those with osteoporosis. Note the dress and 
jacket on the cover, the blouses on Page 4, the jacket dress on Page 8 and the 
pantsuit on Page 25.

Q: All of a sudden my panty hose are bursting out in runs. Is it true that 
freezing panty hose before wearing helps preserve their longevity? -- L.N. 
</P>
<P>
A: That's one of Heloise's famous hints. I've never tried it, but it's one the 
research-and-development team for Hanes Hosiery (they also manufacture L'Eggs) 
puts in the category of old wives' tales. 
</P>
<P>
The National Assn. of Hosiery Manufacturers suggest some tips for prolonging 
the life of panty hose. "Be honest about size," the hosiery experts urge. "Too 
small hose can mean runs from tugging." 
</P>
<P>
If you've gained weight recently, perhaps your panty hose runs are emanating 
from tugging as well as the additional pull and pressure of added girth. 
</P>
<P>
Here are other tips from the association: Buy hose with a little spandex for 
stretch; pull hose on gently; watch for rings, hangnails and rough fingernail 
edges that cause snags.

Q: Lately, I find many garments with fiber content labeled ramie. Could you 
tell me more about this fiber? I note that the care instructions always suggest 
ironing at a high temperature. Does this mean that the fiber is in the linen 
family? As you probably know, that fiber also requires high ironing 
temperatures. -- G.K. 
</P>
<P>
A: Ramie, also known as China grass, grows in tropical and subtropical climates 
and yields a fiber similar to flax, so your hunch about linen is essentially 
correct. 
</P>
<P>
This strong, lustrous fiber was used traditionally to make fishing nets and 
fire hoses. Like cotton and linen, it is absorbent and comfortable to wear. 
</P>
<P>
The people at the International Fabricare Institute recommend caring for ramie 
as you care for linen and cotton -- either wash or dry clean, according to 
care-label instructions. They say ramie is somewhat difficult to iron. 
</P>
<P>
For best results, they suggest ironing while still damp or misting thoroughly 
with a water spray and ironing with a steam iron. 
</P>

Q: I'm nearly 70 and living on a very small stipend. I wrote a novel, hoping to 
salvage my situation, and it has been accepted by a New York agent for 
representation. If the novel sells, I will be invited by the publisher to an 
expense-paid trip to New York, a night in a fine hotel and dinner with an 
editor to discuss a contract. Here's where you come in. What do I wear? I can 
come up with the price of an outfit, but it must be reasonable. I am 5-feet-4, 
140 pounds (well-distributed, considering) and young looking for my age -- 
despite my white, pageboy-style hair. I have an imperishable theatrical bent. 
Any ideas? -- V.T. 
</P>
<P>
A: How about renting a tuxedo for the time you'll be in New York? Tuxedo 
dressing for women -- a look the French call le smoking -- is the height of 
fashion right now. You can rent a tux for $50 to $75 -- far less than the cost 
of a new outfit -- and satisfy your theatrical bent at the same time. 
</P>
<P>
For day, wear the tux jacket with a black skirt and plain, non-tuxedo blouse in 
the color of your choice. For night, put on the whole works. 
</P>
<P>
Q: What kind of man's shirt is best for wear with a classic, three-button 
navy-blue suit? The striped shirts with white collars don't seem to look right 
with this cut. -- T.P. 
</P>
<P>
A: You may call the three-button suit a classic, but it's also the big new look 
in European menswear. Wear it with a clean, classic all-white shirt. 
</P>
<P>
Many of the new white shirts have a subtle texture, as in a white-on-white 
satin stripe, a dobby or a herringbone weave, but just plain old cotton 
broadcloth also is enjoying a return to grace. 
</P>
<P>
The new passion for white also has affected striped shirts, with the latest 
versions featuring fine pinstripes rather than the bolder stripes that Ivan 
Boesky first made famous as an inside-trader look.
