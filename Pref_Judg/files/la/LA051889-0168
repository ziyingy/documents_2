Outlining an unyielding approach to narcotics policy, the official in charge of 
the Bush Administration's war on drugs Wednesday urged professional sports to 
adopt uniform regulations that would put an end to the careers of any athletes 
found twice to have used illegal drugs. 
</P>
<P>
William J. Bennett, director of the White House office of drug control policy, 
said that such severe penalties would complement a similarly harsh policy for 
teen-agers, whom he said should be expelled from school if caught for the 
second time using or possessing drugs. 
</P>
<P>
"If that is the standard for 16-year-olds, shouldn't it at least be the 
standard for professionals?" Bennett asked after a meeting here with 
commissioners and players' officials from professional football, baseball and 
basketball. 
</P>
<P>
Participants in the session said that the sports officials responded without 
enthusiasm to Bennett's suggestion. But in what the White House official called 
a "frank and candid exchange," they agreed to discuss the issue further at a 
meeting later this summer. 
</P>
<P>
The proposal, more stringent than any now in place in the sporting world, 
represents the latest in a series of Bennett initiatives calling for a national 
refusal to tolerate even casual drug use. Among the penalties Bennett has 
proposed for minor drug offenders are weekend imprisonment in jails or "boot 
camps" and the confiscation of automobiles. 
</P>
<P>
"How do I justify a policy like this for kids when I don't have one like it for 
adults?" Bennett said in an interview later. He said that he had "pressed the 
issue" repeatedly during the session, which marked the first time that 
officials of the three major sports had gathered to discuss the drug problem. 
</P>
<P>
"Professional sports play a very important part in American life, a very 
important part in American imagination," Bennett said. "Since they are so 
important, they ought to be a focal point of our effort." 
</P>
<P>
In addition to rules banning drug use by players, Bennett indicated that he 
might call for mandatory drug testing of professional athletes. He said, 
however, that he had not discussed that idea with the sports officials. 
</P>
<P>
Although the officials said that they favor stiffer penalties for drug use, 
most voiced qualms about the severity of Bennett's approach. 
</P>
<P>
"We're always behind harsher penalties but we're also behind the need for 
rehabilitation," said Gene Upshaw, executive director of the National Football 
League Players Assn. 
</P>
<P>
Said Baseball Commissioner Bart Giamatti: "One can quarrel about discipline but 
what we found out today was that (Bennett) and we have very similar views 
without having identical views either philosophically or practically." 
</P>
<P>
Only professional basketball now requires the expulsion of players who use 
drugs and that punishment is enforced only after the third offense. 
</P>
<P>
Charles Grantham, executive director of the National Basketball Assn. Players 
Assn., indicated that his group would be likely to oppose any effort to remove 
the "third strike" from the league's policy. 
</P>
<P>
Bennett has no direct authority to impose rules on professional sports, just as 
he has no authority to order schools to expel drug-using students. But his 
recommendations conceivably could be implemented in Administration-backed 
legislation. 
</P>
<P>
Although the commissioners and players' representatives praised Bennett's 
approach to the drug problem in sports, most said that their remaining 
differences with him could not easily be resolved. 
</P>
<P>
"I don't know how many people around that table agreed with his approach," said 
Upshaw. "But I don't know that that's going to stop him from writing the policy 
that he is going to write."
