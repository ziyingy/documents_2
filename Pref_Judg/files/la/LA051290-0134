Australian biologist Charles Birch, co-recipient this week of the $684,000 
Templeton Prize for Progress in Religion, said he will donate part of his share 
to a religious philosophy center based at the School of Theology at Claremont. 
</P>
<P>
The donation was confirmed by John B. Cobb Jr., founder-director of the 
17-year-old Center for Process Studies, who said it will be used to establish 
an endowment fund. "It gives us much greater confidence that we can keep 
going," said Cobb.

The 1990 Templeton Prize was presented Tuesday in London by Prince Philip to 
Indian lawyer Baba Amte, 75, a Hindu whose work for the sick crosses India's 
religious divisions, and Birch, 72, a retired Sydney professor who has explored 
links between science and religious faith. 
</P>
<P>
The Australian was praised as an "original thinker (who) uses modern 
discoveries in natural science to expand man's understanding of God as designer 
and creator of the universe and its creatures." 
</P>
<P>
Birch said he will use his prize to fund an annual lecture at the University of 
Sydney on human aspects of science and technology and a Christian social ethics 
project in Geneva as well as helping the Claremont center. The Methodist layman 
has served as vice chairman of the World Council of Churches' Church and 
Society committee. 
</P>
<P>
Birch, co-author with Cobb of a book titled "The Liberation of Life," is 
scheduled to appear at a seminar from 3 p.m. to 5 p.m. Sunday at the School of 
Theology at Claremont. 
</P>
<P>
Cobb said he was not free to disclose the amount of the expected donation. 
</P>
<P>
Some concern had arisen on the research center's future because of the 
approaching retirement of Cobb, a world-renowed theologian. Cobb retires from 
the seminary faculty next month. Although he will stay with the center and do 
some teaching in Claremont, he will also lighten some of his duties.

Process studies focus on the philosophy of the late mathematician-physicist 
Alfred North Whitehead and other scholars who have interpreted and applied his 
insights to a unifying theory of life, the nature of deity and the universe. 
</P>
<P>
The center has attempted to apply Whitehead's metaphysical views in conferences 
and seminars to practical problems of interfaith dialogue, environmental 
problems and, most recently, male sexuality. The center also publishes a 
scholarly journal and is working on a film project for television, Cobb said.

The Rev. Frederick J. Beebe, who will turn 64 in October, will retire Jan. 1 as 
executive of the 122,200-member Presbyterian Synod of Southern California and 
Hawaii. Beebe, a former pastor in Claremont, has held the top synod post since 
1978. The synod, which embraces 310 congregations, will convene next Saturday 
at Westminster Gardens in Duarte to conduct its first semiannual meeting this 
year.

The interfaith VISN cable television network, launched in September, 1988, is 
reportedly seen, for at least part of each day, on 10 cable systems in Southern 
California. Last Saturday, about 50 people from some of the 22 religious bodies 
that contribute to VISN's nationwide programming met in Pasadena to coordinate 
lobbying efforts to expand the list. Nelson Price, newly elected president and 
chief executive officer of the New York-based network, spoke to the meeting. 
Interfaith cooperation is still a new venture for some organizers, however. 
Because the gathering was on a Saturday, Jewish and Muslim representatives did 
not attend. A second planning meeting is scheduled for Thursday, June 7.

series began Easter Sunday. JOHN DART
