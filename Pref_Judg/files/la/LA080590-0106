INS officers entered houses in the 200 block of South 36th Street and the 3000 
block of Imperial Avenue at 4 p.m. Friday to make the arrests, officials said.

The houses served as staging areas for multinational illegal aliens waiting to 
be transported to Los Angeles and then to final destinations across the 
country, officials said.

INS agents and San Diego police also pulled over a vehicle northbound on 
Interstate 5 near Del Mar Heights that they said contained two principal
