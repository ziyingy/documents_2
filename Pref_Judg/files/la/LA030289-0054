There are three statements we can make with assurance about oats. One, a bowl 
of oatmeal or cold oat cereal served with low-fat milk is an excellent 
breakfast food. Two, the fiber in oats seems to lower cholesterol. And three, 
the importance of oats in this latter role has been exploded way out of 
proportion. All the hype has accompanied steady streams of new products -- some 
oat-based and others containing little more than "essence of oats" -- that are 
inundating the supermarket shelves. 
</P>
<P>
The oat and serum-cholesterol link is not as new as you might think. It was 
established 25 years ago when researchers fed a group of 21 volunteers almost 
five ounces of rolled oats, baked into bread, for three weeks. At the beginning 
of the study, the subjects' cholesterol averaged 251 milligrams, a figure 
within the high-risk range for coronary heart disease. 
</P>
<P>
By the end of 21 days, levels had dropped 11%. According to current 
recommendations, the subjects would now fall into what the National Cholesterol 
Education Program terms the "borderline to high category." The result is 
impressive, but a very heavy dose of oats was involved. When the special 
oatmeal bread was replaced with regular bread, within two weeks cholesterol 
levels had climbed back almost to where they had been when the study began. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Cholesterol Levels Dropped 
</P>
<P>
Since then, several investigators have confirmed and expanded the 
cholesterol-lowering finding, using rolled oats, oat bran and a mixture of oat 
bran and beans. Of particular interest are two studies in which subjects were 
asked to consume more moderate amounts of oat fiber. In both investigations, 
average cholesterol levels were below the recommended 200 milligrams per 
deciliter. In one, reported three years ago, 208 volunteers were first placed 
on a fat-modified diet. Less than 30% of the calories they ate came from fat, 
and dietary cholesterol intake was less than 250 milligrams per day. 
</P>
<P>
At the end of six weeks, cholesterol levels had dropped a little more than 5%. 
At that point, subjects were divided into three groups. In one, 60 grams of oat 
bran replaced a calorically equal amount of carbohydrate. In a second group, 60 
grams of oatmeal was used in place of a calorically equal amount of 
carbohydrate. A third continued with the basic diet. After the second six 
weeks, serum-cholesterol levels among those whose diets included the oats 
dropped about 3% more. 
</P>
<P>
And in a small study reported last year, 72 volunteer medical students were 
divided into three groups and given one of three types of muffins. One 
contained wheat, a second wheat and oats, and a third, oats. After 28 days, 
cholesterol levels among those taking just 17 grams of oat bran (a little over 
half an ounce) fell about 5% from 179 to 170 milligrams per deciliter of blood. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Research Supports Findings 
</P>
<P>
And significantly, it was the LDL, or low-density lipoprotein, cholesterol 
fraction -- the type associated with higher risk of heart disease -- that fell. 
Levels of HDL-cholesterol, the "good" type that helps prevent arteries from 
clogging, remained unchanged. In terms of oat bran, the amount used in this 
study translates to about two-thirds cup of cooked oat bran or one cup of 
cooked oatmeal. 
</P>
<P>
The upshot of this research is that oat bran, either plain or in oatmeal or 
cold oat cereal, does appear to help lower serum cholesterol. But we must 
highlight the word help. The hefty amounts of oat bran used in earlier studies 
clearly are not appropriate to consume day-in, day-out. And if taken in the 
reasonable amounts used in the medical-student study by someone whose 
cholesterol level was, say, 253 milligrams per deciliter, the resulting 5% that 
might occur would still put cholesterol levels in the high-risk range, more 
than 240 milligrams. So adding oats is no license for shedding a diet low in 
fat, especially saturated fat and cholesterol. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Check Ingredient Lists 
</P>
<P>
And by the way, when it comes to buying oat products, be sure to read the 
labels carefully. You know what you are getting when you buy oatmeal or some of 
the traditional types of cold oat cereals. But with newer products the picture 
quickly muddies. 
</P>
<P>
Some oat cereals, which may contain considerable oat bran, also contain highly 
saturated coconut oil. In oatmeal bread, oats may be so far down on the 
ingredients list that the amount contained is small. Others, like a package of 
cookies we examined recently in which oat bran appeared after juice concentrate 
in the ingredients list, contain an insignificant quantity of oat bran. 
</P>
<P>
And still others, such as potato chips dusted with oat bran, are too outrageous 
to deserve comment.

Pantothenic Acid Pills OK for Chickens, Not Humans 
</P>
<P>
Question: I was in a health-food store with a friend recently when she bought 
some pantothenic acid pills as a treatment for dermatitis. She said it was a 
nutrient, but I had never heard of it. What is it? And is there any reason to 
think it might work? 
</P>
<P>
Answer: Not unless your friend is a chicken, and even then under usual 
circumstances she wouldn't need it. Pantothenic acid is one of the B vitamins. 
It is associated with dermatologic problems in animals fed experimental diets 
deficient in the vitamin. Back in the 1930s a severe dermatitis developed in 
chicks fed a special diet. The condition could be reversed by giving the birds 
a preparation made from liver, which was labeled the "chick anti-dermatitis 
factor" and soon identified as pantothenic acid. 
</P>
<P>
The vitamin is necessary to health; it participates in a great variety of 
reactions in the body. But here's why your friend was bringing coals to 
Newcastle: Pantothenic acid is so widely available, present in so many foods, 
that there is little reason to be concerned about getting enough. The name 
itself comes from the Greek pantothen, which means "from everywhere." 
</P>
<P>
In fact, it took researchers years to produce experimental pantothenic acid 
deficiency in humans, and they succeeded only by using a vitamin antagonist 
along with the purified diet. There were no dermatologic symptoms associated 
with the deficiency, by the way. And there is no reason to believe it would be 
of benefit in treating skin conditions with no nutritional cause. 
</P>
<P>
Among the best food sources of pantothenic acid are liver, kidney, egg yolk, 
wheat bran and fresh vegetables. 
</P>
<P>
Q: I have always been curious to know how puffed cereals are made, other than 
that they are "shot from guns." Can you explain the process? 
</P>
<P>
A: The principle involved resembles popping corn. In making puffed cereals, the 
starchy endosperm of the wheat or rice kernel is first cooked to gelatinize the 
starch and then partially dried. Or, sometimes, a mash of cereal dough is 
pressed into moist pellets. At this point the kernels are placed in a puffing 
gun, where they are heated under very high pressure and very hot temperature, 
converting the moisture in the kernels to steam. 
</P>
<P>
The gun is then opened, the steam under pressure within the kernels expands 
explosively and the kernels puff. They are then toasted, sometimes sugar 
coated, and then dried. Rice may also be oven puffed, a process in which the 
grain is cooked, rolled flat, and then toasted quickly, where blistering 
lightens the grain. 
</P>
<P>
Puffed cereals are among the oldest members of the dry-cereal industry. 
According to Harold McGee, in "On Food and Cooking: The Lore of the Kitchen" 
(Charles Scribner's Sons), they were the creation of Alexander Anderson. 
</P>
<P>
In experiments conducted at the New York Botanical Gardens, he filled test 
tubes with cereal starch, then sealed and heated them. When they shattered, a 
porous puffy mass of starch emerged. He then repeated the experiment with whole 
grains. And working at Quaker Oats, in Chicago, he developed the first 
steam-injected puffing guns. Puffed rice was first sold at the St. Louis 
World's Fair in 1904 as a snack food. A year later, it was marketed as a 
breakfast cereal.

Q: I really enjoyed your recent column about easy-to-prepare, low-fat soups. I 
have an additional request: We are very fond of lentil soup, but most of the 
recipes I've seen include much too much fat. The few I have tried that had less 
fat did not turn out well. Do you have a suggestion.? 
</P>
<P>
A: We recently came across a lentil soup that fills the bill nicely. Saute a 
large chopped onion and one cup chopped celery in two tablespoons oil until 
lightly colored. Place in a large pot. Wash one pound of lentils and add them 
to the pot. Add eight cups water, a 12-ounce can of plain tomato sauce, a 
little salt and plenty of black pepper. Simmer until the lentils are tender, 
about an hour or so. Then add one or two bunches of roughly chopped escarole. 
</P>
<P>
A serving of the soup has 295 calories and as much protein as two ounces of 
meat, and it is virtually fat free. The escarole not only contributes to the 
flavor, but provides generous amounts of beta carotene, which the body converts 
to Vitamin A. You may, if you want, add a cup or two of diced potatoes or 
carrots or both when the lentils are just tender. The soup can be topped with 
Parmesan cheese. 
</P>
<P>
Q: I know that different studies have presented conflicting information about 
the link between coffee drinking and heart disease. Has anyone checked into 
whether different brewing methods might be a factor? 
</P>
<P>
A: Researchers from the Tromso, Norway, heart study recently focused on just 
that question, using a group of 18,000 men and women between the ages of 20 and 
59. They were asked how many cups of coffee they drank each day and what method 
was used to prepare it. By far the most common method was boiled coffee, a 
process in which the grounds are in longer contact with the water than in other 
techniques. 
</P>
<P>
In fact, 8% of the subjects drank boiled coffee most or all of the time. Next 
most popular was filtered coffee, while decaffeinated and instant coffee were 
used only rarely. Only 7% of the men and 9% of the women drank no coffee. 
</P>
<P>
The investigators found that serum-cholesterol levels rose significantly with 
increasing coffee consumption only among those who drank boiled coffee. Indeed, 
among men who consumed a formidable 9 cups of coffee or more a day, cholesterol 
concentrations were 11% higher than among men who drank none. In women, the 
difference was 8%. 
</P>
<P>
The investigators suggest that differences in brewing methods may help explain 
the fact that their results differ from those of other groups who have found no 
effect. They suggest that some unidentified substance in coffee may affect 
cholesterol levels. In Norway, the combination of high consumption and 
widespread use of boiled coffee may represent a special case. Indeed, they 
suggest that in Finland, some of the decline in serum cholesterol may well be 
attributed to a change in brewing methods since the 1960s. 
</P>
<P>
Q: I read a new potentially harmful substance has been discovered in alcoholic 
beverages. Can you tell me about it? 
</P>
<P>
A: A compound called urethane, or ethyl carbonate, forms as a by-product during 
the manufacturing of certain alcoholic drinks. It has been shown to cause 
cancer in some laboratory animals. The compound forms during fermentation and, 
if heated during the processing of alcohol, levels can increase. To some 
extent, therefore, the effect is unavoidable. 
</P>
<P>
Levels also may be affected by the soil in which grapes are grown, the variety 
of grape used and even the weather. Urethane levels can increase in some 
products, especially wines, during shipping, storage and handling. Some 
processing can raise urethane levels. Using urea to stimulate fermentation in 
wine production has been abandoned for that reason. 
</P>
<P>
Concern first surfaced late in 1985 when Canadian authorities found the 
chemical in certain wines and distilled spirits. At that time the Food and Drug 
Administration (FDA) and the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco and Firearms (ATF), 
which share responsibility for regulating alcohol, began to seek ways to reduce 
or eliminate the compound from alcoholic beverages. Because as many as 400,000 
different labels of alcoholic beverages may be on the market, sampling to 
assess urethane levels is a formidable task. 
</P>
<P>
Evidence suggests that bourbons -- because of the type of distilling process 
required -- generally contain the highest levels, while vodka and gin have 
negligible amounts. Levels in plum and cherry brandy have varied from 200 to 
12,000 parts per billion (ppb); in dessert wine from less than four to several 
hundred ppb, and in table wine from zero to 25 ppb. 
</P>
<P>
Manufacturers are experimenting with alternating production methods that will 
reduce urethane levels in finished products. And they have set time goals for 
reducing urethane content. Both the FDA and ATF are working with foreign 
countries to lower the urethane levels in imported beverages. 
</P>
<P>
But while this burst of effort is under way, we have yet to quantify the risk 
to humans. In 1988, the National Toxicology Program agreed to give the problem 
of urethane its highest priority, to better define potential hazards. 
</P>

Q: One of the things I love is mincemeat pie, but I don't know anything about 
its nutritional value. I always eat it at other people's houses and don't make 
it myself, so I don't even know what's in it. For example, does mincemeat pie 
contain meat? 
</P>
<P>
A: According to John F. Mariani's "Dictionary of American Food and Drink" 
(Ticknor and Fields: 1983), mincemeat typically contains chopped fruits, suet, 
spices and sometimes meat, usually baked in a pie crust. The name is derived 
from the word meaning "to chop finely," says Mariani, which in turn comes from 
the Latin minuere, meaning "to diminish." Dating from the 16th Century, the 
word connoted a pie of fruit, spices and suet, only occasionally containing any 
meat at all. In Colonial America, these pies were often made during the fall 
and preserved to be eaten during the long winters. 
</P>
<P>
Nowadays, mincemeat made both with and without some type of meat is available 
in the supermarket. But the amount of meat (which appears in the ingredients 
list after salt) is too small to make a difference nutritionally. One-third of 
a cup of mincemeat provides about 200 calories, 96% of them from the 
carbohydrate in both the fruit and sugar used to prepare it.
