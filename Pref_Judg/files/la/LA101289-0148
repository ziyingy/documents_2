Tropical Storm Dan pounded Manila and nearby Philippine provinces, killing 31 
people and raising to 149 the death toll in two storms that struck the country 
in less than a week, news reports and officials said. Carrying peak winds of 60 
m.p.h., the storm roared across provinces on the southern portion of the main 
Luzon island from the Pacific Ocean and swiped Manila as it swirled out into 
the South China Sea.
