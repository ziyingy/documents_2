The San Diego Housing Commission slapped a San Ysidro tenant activist with a 
lease-violation notice when she posted public signs in a campaign against 
neighborhood drug dealers, stirring neighbors' fears of retaliation, according 
to testimony to the Housing Commission Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
Donna Byrd-Reis said she posted the signs in her car windows after she found 
her tires slashed Labor Day, in the midst of her yearlong battle against drug 
dealers, drug users, alien smugglers and transients who she said used the 
parking lot of her Alaquinas Drive apartment complex. 
</P>
<P>
Byrd-Reis, who said she and her family had been threatened by dealers because 
of her campaign to drive them from the Vista del Valle project, plastered her 
windshield with banners reading "TIRE WORK: COURTESY OF DRUG DEALER &amp; 
'GANGS', INC." and "DRUG DEALER, WHAT'S NEXT, WHO'S NEXT?" 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Fear of Retaliation 
</P>
<P>
Three other tenants, fearful that they could be hurt by retaliating dealers, 
complained to the Housing Commission, which operates the complex, said Dana 
Sievert, housing program director. 
</P>
<P>
Byrd-Reis was given 24 hours to remove the signs or be given a lease-violation 
notice for endangering the safety of other tenants. On Nov. 4, the sanction was 
made official, eliminating Byrd-Reis' status as a tenant in good standing. 
</P>
<P>
Although the penalty has little practical effect -- Byrd-Reis would have to 
commit three more infractions before facing eviction -- it does prevent 
Byrd-Reis from becoming the apartment block's official representative if it 
forms a tenant council, Sievert said. 
</P>
<P>
"It's the most ridiculous thing I've ever heard," said San Diego Councilman Bob 
Filner, who represents San Ysidro and has worked with Byrd-Reis and Residents 
Organizing to Assist Residents, or ROAR, the tenant group she leads. "If I get 
a parking ticket, I'm not disqualified from being a city councilman. We should 
be working with her, instead of ignoring her." 
</P>
<P>
Filner, who is a housing commissioner, promised to investigate Byrd-Reis' claim 
Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
"If we want to express ourselves, the San Diego Housing Commission should allow 
us to do it, whatever form it takes, as long as it's non-libelous, non-profane, 
and doesn't incite a riot," Byrd-Reis said. 
</P>
<P>
But Sievert, who agreed that the project was the site of drug activity, said 
that Housing Commission administrators took action in consideration of other 
tenants' safety. 
</P>
<P>
"As property managers, we need to be concerned with the overall safety of the 
place, and we'd had some calls about that," she said. "The residents were 
concerned that whoever did the first action would come back and retaliate for 
the sign." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
'Beyond Activism' 
</P>
<P>
"It goes beyond activism that is totally constructive," said Evan Becker, the 
Housing Commission's executive director. 
</P>
<P>
The commission fulfilled Byrd-Reis and fellow tenants' most urgent request 
Thursday, when it approved a contract to hire security guards for Vista del 
Valle and two other apartment complexes it manages. 
</P>
<P>
Three security guards will patrol Byrd-Reis' parking lot from 8 p.m. to 4 a.m. 
on a trial basis beginning Feb. 1, Sievert said. The move is a significant 
policy shift for the Housing Commission, which had been wary of the expense, 
potential liability and precedent of getting into the security business, Becker 
said. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Protection Needed 
</P>
<P>
But Byrd-Reis and some other tenants believe that security guards are the only 
way to permanently rid the complex of dealers. Although police have been 
responsive to calls, even Byrd-Reis has refused to testify in court because of 
fear of retaliation, she said. 
</P>
<P>
The Housing Commission has secured doors and windows, improved outside lighting 
and added landscaping in an effort to deter drug activity, but failed, she 
said. Byrd-Reis said she has taken photos of drug dealers and confronted 
transients to no avail. 
</P>
<P>
"That type of activity is like cockroaches," she said. "You bring the light and 
they disappear." 
</P>
<P>
Byrd-Reis said she plans to appeal the lease-violation notice.
