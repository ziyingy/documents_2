Cousteau Wants Antarctic Mine Ban: To save the "last unspoiled continent of the 
planet," Jacques Cousteau has called for a permanent ban on mining on 
Antarctica. He has already forced France to endorse the effort, after gathering 
more than 1 million signatures in protest the Antarctic Mineral Convention, 
which would allow commercial prospecting and exploitation of resources in the 
Antarctic. Australia and New Zealand are among other nations opposing that 
convention.
