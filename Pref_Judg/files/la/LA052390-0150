Perhaps the best way to judge the excitement building Tuesday for the opening 
of a newly expanded FAO Schwarz toy store at South Coast Plaza was to count the 
number of noses pressed to the glass. There were many. 
</P>
<P>
Few could resist a peek at the big stuffed lions and giraffes staring back at 
them through the window as workers readied the store for its opening today. 
Some stopped for a glimpse at the miniature red BMW with Babar the Elephant 
behind the wheel, or the giant talking moon face that will greet shoppers. 
</P>
<P>
The goal, explained an exuberant FAO Schwarz President Peter L. Harris, is to 
go beyond being the pre-eminent name in toy retailing and create a giant 
retailing fantasy land that no kid -- or parent -- can resist. 
</P>
<P>
"We really have gone far out to create the ultimate experience of music, color 
and animation," Harris said as he bounced between displays to show off some of 
the latest toys. "It's not just a box with merchandise. The store itself is a 
plaything." 
</P>
<P>
The South Coast Plaza store is the last of FAO's 16 U.S. stores to receive a 
face lift in a program that began when the flagship store on Manhattan's Fifth 
Avenue moved across the street and was redone. Harris said the Orange County 
toy shop has been such a success that he wanted to tinker with ideas in other 
FAO stores before incorporating the best of them. 
</P>
<P>
For starters, FAO Schwarz has moved to a location with one-third more display 
space than its former location. The new store is near the Carousel Court and 
next door to the Disney store. 
</P>
<P>
When browsers drift past the giant building block entrance and into the store, 
the big happy moon face with twitching eyes will detect their presence and 
greet them with a cheerful: "Welcome to fun, to happiness, to FAO's World of 
Toys!" 
</P>
<P>
To their right will be mounds of giant stuffed animals with giant price tags to 
match. To their left, strollers will find a sea of dolls and stacks of board 
games and video screens displaying Nintendo games. 
</P>
<P>
A special FAO Schwarz song plays over and over to set the theme for the store. 
A talking five-foot robot will converse with youngsters, who can also squeal at 
the sight of an acrobatic monkey doll wheeling across a 30-foot-long high wire. 
</P>
<P>
Harris, a native Californian who once headed the new defunct Gemco department 
store chain, said the store will maintain its distinctive inventory and 
services that make FAO Schwarz "the Tiffany of toy stores." 
</P>
<P>
The chain, for instance, was first to sell a new Sony Corp. toy that allows 
children to electronically sketch pictures that can be transferred to a TV 
screen, he said. For Christmas, the store will stock a special collectors' 
edition of a Barbie doll dressed in a blue satin gown. 
</P>
<P>
The larger store isn't trying to be an upscale version of toy supermarkets such 
as Toys R Us, Harris said. Unlike the typical Toys R Us shopper, FAO customers 
usually arrive at the store without knowing what they want to buy but expecting 
to find the unique. To help affluent working parents, the store offers such 
service as telephone ordering and same-day delivery. 
</P>
<P>
Harris said he expects sales at the new South Coast Plaza store to be double 
what they were at its former location.
