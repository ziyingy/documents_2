ANSWERS 
</P>
<P>
1. True. This is an autosomal dominant disorder; if you have one parent with 
this faulty gene, you have a 50% chance of inheriting it. 
</P>
<P>
2. True. 
</P>
<P>
3. True. 
</P>
<P>
4. True. (CF is an autosomal recessive disorder. If both parents carry the 
harmful gene, the child who receives the defective gene from both parents may 
have a significant birth defect.) 
</P>
<P>
5. False. 
</P>
<P>
6. True. This is a disorder that affects mainly blacks. 
</P>
<P>
7. True. This is a disorder that affects mainly people of Eastern European 
Jewish heritage. 
</P>
<P>
8. True. This is an X-linked (or sex-linked) disorder passed from a mother to 
her sons. Each son has a 50% risk of inheriting the gene. Each daughter has an 
equal chance of being a carrier as her mother was but is usually unaffected. 
</P>
<P>
9. True. This is an X-linked disorder. 
</P>
<P>
10. True. This tends to run in families. 
</P>
<P>
11. True. 
</P>
<P>
12. False. 
</P>
<P>
13. True. Recent research suggests that our genes play a great part in obesity. 
</P>
<P>
14. False. 
</P>
<P>
15. True. An autosomal dominant disorder characterized by elongation of bones. 
</P>
<P>
16. True. Evidence for genetic predisposition to alcoholism continues to grow. 
However, many researchers believe it results from the interaction of heredity 
and environment. 
</P>
<P>
17. True. However, research indicates only 10% of cases are clearly inherited. 
</P>
<P>
18. True. 
</P>
<P>
19. True. A genetic origin of small-cell lung cancer, a particularly deadly 
form that only recently has been identified. 
</P>
<P>
20. False.
