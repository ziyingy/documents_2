A chain of low hills began to rise. Moving plates beneath the earth's crust 
pushed them skyward. They climbed imperceptibly at first, fractions of an inch 
over centuries. On the western flank of the central range, a river accelerated 
into a torrent. The crashing water cut a narrow, V-shaped canyon out of the 
granite. 
</P>
<P>
 Twenty-three million years passed. An icecap enshrouded the summit of the 
range. Tongues of ice streamed down into the canyon. The ice thickened. It 
pushed and ground against the canyon walls and polished the granite domes. More 
glaciers came. They scoured the canyon into a U-shaped valley, about a mile 
wide and seven miles long. 
</P>
<P>
 Sheets and blocks of rocks broke loose from the valley's granite sides. The 
falling rocks deepened the cliffs into abruptly rising walls. Sculpted spires, 
crevices and alcoves appeared. Waterfalls leaped over the recesses. During the 
past 10,000 years, the river filled the glacial lakes with sediment and gravel. 
Seeds blew in. And shimmering flower-sprinkled meadows grew, bordered by the 
towering, sheer walls of rock. 
</P>
<P>
 Man arrived about 3,000 years ago; from where, nobody is certain. He hunted 
deer and burned fires but left few enduring scars. And then descendants of 
European settlers discovered the wondrous valley, and the wars over Yosemite 
began. 
</P>
<P>
 THIS WAS SUPPOSED TO BE a special year for Yosemite National Park. It turns 
100 tomorrow, and festivities and fanfare will mark the milestone. But a nasty, 
raging battle threatens to overshadow the entire centennial. It is a 
late-breaking skirmish in a classic American conflict: use versus preservation 
in the nation's wild lands. This time, the battle lines have been drawn over a 
park concessioner's contract. And the prize is the heart of Yosemite, the 
seven-mile-long Yosemite Valley. 
</P>
<P>
In the high season, from a ledge halfway up the valley cliffs, the conflict is 
clear. Majestic granite walls, carved and sculpted over eons, tower overhead. 
Half Dome looms in the distance. But look downward, and Yosemite Valley might 
be taken for a suburban subdivision. The baby-blue tint of a large swimming 
pool catches the eye first; then dozens of brown buildings and white tent 
cabins compete for attention. Cars and buses sit sandwiched neatly into asphalt 
parking lots, a sea of metal gleaming in the sunlight. A garbage truck passes 
by, its engine loud enough to puncture the mesmerizing thunder of a waterfall 
only a few feet away. 
</P>
<P>
There are about 1,300 buildings in Yosemite Valley, plus 30 miles of paved 
roads, eight miles of paved bikeways, 17 acres of asphalt parking lots, a 
vehicle maintenance garage, three swimming pools, a tennis court, an 
ice-skating rink, a jail, a courthouse, a gas station and two warehouses. To a 
preservationist, the roar of traffic and the stretch of development are 
intrusions. To a concessioner,the garbage trucks, parking lots and swimming 
pools are the price that must be paid if visitors are to enjoy comfortable 
access to the park. 
</P>
<P>
In 1993, the biggest concessioner contract in Yosemite goes up for grabs. The 
Yosemite Park and Curry Co. -- owned by MCA Inc., the entertainment giant that 
brought you "Jaws" and "Back to the Future I," "II" and "III" -- must negotiate 
to renew its for-profit hold on most of the buildings and many of the services 
in Yosemite, including the Ahwahnee Hotel and Yosemite Lodge. In the running 
against MCA will most likely be a nonprofit organization formed by 
conservationists. 
</P>
<P>
The conservationists want nothing less than MCA's ouster from the park. The 
terms of the new contract, they say, should mandate fewer hotel rooms, fewer 
cars, fewer parking spaces and less of everything that isn't "natural" in 
Yosemite. 
</P>
<P>
But the contract is just a symbol of the contention at Yosemite. The real 
conflict is about power and who will wield it. As the park's 100th anniversary 
kicks off, the balance of power is clear: The advantage lies not with the 
National Park Service, the agency nominally in charge, nor with the 
preservationists, the self-styled defenders of nature. The advantage in the 
battle brewing in Yosemite Valley lies with the Curry Co. and MCA, the 
corporation that makes millions of dollars off the most scenic valley in the 
world. 
</P>
<P>
SEATED AROUND A TABLE in the dining room of Yosemite's luxurious Ahwahnee Hotel 
several years ago, two government bureaucrats from Washington watched in 
fascination as Edward Hardy, president of the Yosemite Park and Curry Co., held 
court. The federal officials had come to Yosemite to go over the park's budget 
with Robert Binnewies, then park superintendent. "We had not asked to meet with 
the concessioner, but before we knew it, he was around us and we were around 
him," remembers one of the bureaucrats. "They definitely wined and dined us. Ed 
was a wonderful host." 
</P>
<P>
The Park Service, the legal caretaker and administrator of Yosemite, should 
have been running the show. Theoretically, the Park Service has complete 
control over the concession. It writes and awards the contract under which the 
concession operates, determines how much the concession pays for the right to 
operate in the park, and decides what the concession can and cannot do. It also 
must approve the prices the concession charges in its stores and for its rooms, 
and the addition of each new vending machine and profit-making center in the 
park. The Park Service even has the final word over the decor in the 
concession's accommodations. 
</P>
<P>
But to the two Washington bureaucrats, Ed Hardy seemed to be in charge at 
Yosemite. He had his ideas about what the park needed, and he was a forceful 
advocate. When he took positions that contradicted those of Binnewies', the 
superintendent fell quiet. In comparison to Hardy, one of the bureaucrats said, 
Binnewies seemed "almost timid. I got the impression that Hardy thought it was 
his park." 
</P>
<P>
More than anyone else, Hardy, 55, a barrel-chested, engaging former Marine, 
personifies the modern-day, MCA-owned Curry Co., and in some eyes, the park 
itself. Congressional staff members who know Hardy call him the "acting 
superintendent of Yosemite." Park superintendents come and go at Yosemite, but 
Hardy is always there, so far outlasting five of them. And he is a man worth 
knowing. A room at the Ahwahnee that might require reservations a year in 
advance may be proffered by Hardy in an instant. 
</P>
<P>
Schooled as a resort manager at the Los Angeles Athletic Club, the Riviera 
Country Club in Pacific Palisades and a Del Webb resort, Hardy came to Yosemite 
in 1974, the year after MCA bought the concession, and found himself in the 
midst of controversy. The corporation had used Yosemite as the setting for a 
television series called "Sierra." MCA crews obtained the Park Service's 
permission to paint a boulder in Yosemite Valley. They also crashed cars into a 
pine tree that had been covered with mattresses hidden under fake bark. 
Although the paint was water-soluble and the tree withstood the impact, 
environmentalists charged that the corporation had defaced a national shrine. 
</P>
<P>
Hardy immediately got to work rebuilding the corporation's image. "I want to 
establish a track record, over a period of time, as the No. 1 environmentally 
concerned company operating in any of the national parks," Hardy told 
Backpacker magazine in 1976. "I really want that image. I need that image." 
</P>
<P>
He went a long way toward improving MCA's reputation in the park. The Curry 
Co., like the largest employer in a company town, is responsible for much of 
what happens in Yosemite Valley. The company owns most of the stores and the 
accommodations, including tent cabins, restaurants and bars. It also rents 
horses, bicycles and rafts, and runs an ice-skating rink during the winter. 
</P>
<P>
Hardy hired an environmental consultant and removed from company stores all 
products harmful to the ozone layer. A recycling program was established, and 
the company bear-proofed its garbage cans, dumpsters and food lockers. Early 
on, Hardy even talked about moving 90% of the Curry Co.'s employee housing out 
of Yosemite Valley. He joined the boards of directors of the Yosemite Assn., a 
nonprofit park educational group with conservationist leanings, and the 
Yosemite Fund, a private group that raises money to restore the park. 
</P>
<P>
Someone who has worked with Hardy at the park for many years describes him this 
way: "He has the personality of a bulldog -- very confident, very persistent. 
Someone once called him the great seducer. He is a very smooth P. R. guy. When 
you go into his office, he flatters you and treats you like you're his 
long-lost brother. Then when you're leaving, he opens this little cabinet where 
he keeps his goodies and gives you a couple of free books." 
</P>
<P>
Hardy, after agreeing to an interview, followed the script. He opened the door 
of his Yosemite Village office and beamed. "Thank you for coming," he said, as 
though the meeting had been his idea. He wore tan trousers and a casual, 
long-sleeved shirt. Seated below portraits of David and Jennie Curry, the 
schoolteachers who founded the original Curry Co. in 1899, Hardy was congenial, 
complimentary and quick to withdraw an opinion if it seemed to offend. At the 
end of the interview, right on schedule, he walked over to a cabinet and pulled 
out a gift: a videotape about Yosemite. 
</P>
<P>
Hardy's commanding presence at the park stems in part from his clout in 
Washington. Park Service budgets that determine what is funded in a national 
park -- and hence what happens in a park -- are decided by Congress. The Park 
Service and its parent agency, the Interior Department, are run by political 
appointees susceptible to political influence. To ensure Congress and the 
Administration know their needs, concessioners are represented in Washington by 
the Conference of National Park Concessioners. 
</P>
<P>
Individual concessioners also do their own lobbying, and one of the most 
effective lobbyists is Hardy. Those who know him in Washington say he manages 
to depict the interests of his company as the needs of Yosemite, and he shows a 
great love for the park. "I don't know of anybody who didn't like the man," 
said Ira Whitlock, a former congressional liaison in the National Park 
Service's Washington headquarters. 
</P>
<P>
So influential is Hardy that he managed in 1986 to obtain a $1.2-million 
congressional appropriation for utilities for a new Curry Co. employee 
dormitory in Yosemite Valley -- when the financially strapped Park Service was 
skimping on maintenance of trails, campgrounds and restrooms. Hardy could make 
such company needs known to congressmen in informal settings. He hosted 
lawmakers on company-paid, mule-pack trips to the high country. Former Rep. 
Tony Coelho (D-Merced), one of Hardy's guests on these trips, obtained the 
dormitory money through a line-item add-on to the Park Service budget. 
</P>
<P>
For nearly two decades, MCA has benefited from the work of Hardy and his staff. 
The number of visitors to Yosemite has jumped from 2.3 million in 1974 to 3.4 
million last year. Accordingly, MCA's profits mushroomed and are estimated at 
$12 million to $17 million a year. The Curry Co. refuses to disclose any 
figures and contends that its profits are actually below average for resorts. 
It does acknowledge, however, that, while amounting to a mere fraction of MCA's 
overall earnings, the Yosemite concession gives the corporation access to one 
of nature's gems. "MCA takes great personal pride in participating in a place 
as world-renowned as Yosemite," a Curry Co. official said. 
</P>
<P>
Under the 30-year contract MCA acquired in 1973, the Curry Co. pays the federal 
government only .75% of its gross receipts each year. In 1988, the most recent 
year for which figures are available, that equaled $590,000, less than the 
Curry Co. spent that year on its public relations office and advertising, 
according to the Park Service. 
</P>
<P>
Recent efforts by preservationists to portray his company as profiteering at 
the expense of the park could unravel all that Hardy has built. He claims that 
environmentalists are being "used" by unnamed outsiders who want a foothold in 
Yosemite when MCA's contract expires. "They want to smear the Curry Co. so they 
can diminish the value of it and get the contract," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Yet Hardy does not seem particularly worried that the preservationists will 
succeed. "We have a long track record, we are well-financed and I believe we 
are the right players to be in the next contract," he said. He points to 
accomplishments: an upgrading of concession buildings in the park, 
company-provided nature education programs for visitors and the relocation of 
some company operations, including the reservation office, from Yosemite to 
Fresno. 
</P>
<P>
He no longer believes that 90% of Curry Co. housing can be moved outside the 
park. (As many as 1,200 Curry Co. employees -- including Hardy -- live in 
Yosemite Valley, a sore point for many preservationists.) Although he foresees 
the possibility of some cutbacks, he insists that most employees must be near 
guests to ensure good service. Moreover, he says, commuting would simply add to 
congestion on park roads. 
</P>
<P>
Looking ahead to the next contract, Hardy argues that more accommodations 
should be kept for tour-bus travelers. The Park Service now permits the Curry 
Co. to set aside 18% of its rooms for tour buses. If the Park Service would 
raise this to 22%, Hardy said, there would be 120 fewer cars overnight in the 
parking lots. But, of course, the kind of people who ride tour buses do not 
want to walk 100 yards in the middle of the night for a bathroom, he continued. 
So Hardy would like to replace about 200 of the company's historic tent cabins 
with two-story motel units with baths. 
</P>
<P>
In spite of Hardy's self-assuredness and his considerable plans, he 
occasionally is reminded that he does not call all the shots. After meeting 
with Interior Secretary Manuel Lujan Jr., the Park Service's boss, this summer 
to discuss concession contracts, Hardy was approached by Steven Goldstein, a 
longtime and influential aide to Lujan. Hardy made known his displeasure over 
news stories emanating from the Interior Department about Lujan's efforts to 
make concessioners share more of their profits with taxpayers. "Hardy gave 
Steve a steely-eyed look and said coldly, 'I see your name in the paper too 
much,' " related a colleague of Goldstein's who ran into the aide shortly after 
the encounter. " 'I don't want to read your name in the paper in connection to 
this. Can't we work something out without the papers?' " 
</P>
<P>
Goldstein, who will not publicly discuss the incident, was indignant. "I work 
for the secretary of Interior and the President of the United States," he 
replied icily. 
</P>
<P>
HOWARD CHAPMAN was the first Park Service official to be rolled by MCA's clout. 
For 15 years, until his retirement in 1987, the 40-year veteran of the Park 
Service served as director of its western region and was responsible for 
Yosemite. MCA came to the park just as Chapman and other park officials were 
developing a blueprint for Yosemite's future. The document was to set policies 
and goals that the park and its concessioner would have to follow. 
</P>
<P>
Chapman said the Park Service in the early 1970s envisioned a plan that would 
stress preservation of the park's natural resources; what he said MCA had in 
mind was a plan that would draw more visitors. 
</P>
<P>
A team of regional park officials led by Chapman met regularly with a team of 
corporate officials from MCA's headquarters in Universal City. As Chapman 
remembers them, the gatherings were at the best unpleasant and at worst 
"downright nasty." 
</P>
<P>
"We found ourselves completely outgunned by the MCA people, who were dead set 
on pursuing the profit motive of their operation," Chapman remembered. One of 
the MCA representatives, an accountant, "hard-lined it all the way. He made us 
feel like we were the ones who were carrying the black hat and trying to keep 
the public from enjoying the park. 
</P>
<P>
"When they were not satisfied with the positions we took," Chapman continued, 
"they would go over our heads to the (Park Service) director in Washington, and 
I'm reasonably sure, they were going over the director's head to the Interior 
secretary." 
</P>
<P>
At the time of his meetings with MCA, Chapman said, the corporation wielded 
political influence within the Nixon Administration, and Nixon appointees 
overrode him when MCA balked over provisions in the plan. 
</P>
<P>
Hardy, who participated in some of the talks, said he did not go over Chapman's 
head and is not aware of any calls by MCA to circumvent the regional director. 
"Our philosophy has been that we operate with the superintendent at Yosemite," 
he said. Hardy contends that the Park Service told MCA that it might be allowed 
an additional 300 lodgings in Yosemite when the corporation bought the 
concession. After the Park Service made it clear it did not want an expansion, 
he said, MCA settled for replacing some cabins and tent cabins without baths 
with 1974-style motel units with baths. 
</P>
<P>
Chapman takes some consolation in the fact that MCA did not obtain everything 
it sought. He said the entertainment conglomerate wanted, among other things, 
to build an aerial tramway from the valley to Glacier Point (a concept once 
favored by the Park Service and renowned Yosemite photographer Ansel Adams) but 
dropped the idea after Chapman and his team resisted. 
</P>
<P>
But the final plan -- completed in 1974 -- left Chapman bitter. Whatever MCA's 
compromises, one of the options attached to the plan included adding more than 
100 hotel rooms in the valley and replacing tent cabins there with motel units. 
To conservationists and Park Service professionals, who had begun with a goal 
of reduced development, this represented a major defeat. The park already was 
too congested for their taste. 
</P>
<P>
"We felt that we had been so knuckled under by MCA that our only salvation 
would be that we would present it to the public, and they would be so outraged 
they would throw it out," Chapman said. 
</P>
<P>
Chapman was right. Conservationists were furious. They denounced MCA in 
impassioned speeches in Yosemite Village, grabbed the attention of the national 
news media and enlisted support from members of Congress. An assistant Interior 
secretary quickly dumped the master-plan options, saying they "appeared to have 
been written by the concessioner." Government investigations were launched, and 
a congressional report charged that the Curry Co. exercised "undue influence" 
over park matters. Park Service Director Ron Walker, who had been Nixon's 
campaign advance man, resigned under fire. 
</P>
<P>
The episode was emblematic of the difficulty all levels of the Park Service 
encounters when it tries to limit concessioners. "If the park superintendent 
crosses the concessioner, the next thing the concessioner does is escalate it 
to the National Park Service director's office in Washington," said Philip 
Stewart, 66, a retired Park Service official in charge of concessions during 
the Carter Administration. "And if he can't get satisfaction or relief, then he 
elevates it to the next level, to Congress. It's just like a game." 
</P>
<P>
Park Service officials who have crossed concessions have lost their jobs. 
Interior Secretary James Watt, appointed by President Reagan, left little doubt 
about where his sympathies lay. At a 1981 conference of concessioners, Watt 
listened to a complaint from a concessioner upset about the actions of a park 
official. 
</P>
<P>
"If a personality is giving you a problem," Watt told the concessioner, in 
widely quoted remarks, "we're going to get rid of the problem or the 
personality, whichever is faster." Shortly thereafter, a Park Service official 
in Washington who had been at odds with some concessions was removed from his 
job. 
</P>
<P>
In addition, a revolving door exists between the Park Service and concessions. 
Those in charge of regulating concessions for the Park Service in Washington 
have included former concession employees and a relative of a park 
concessioner. A former Park Service director and former regional park director 
sit on the board of trustees of a corporation that runs three national park 
concessions. 
</P>
<P>
On top of this, park officials, especially at the superintendent level, where 
most of the concessioner-park action takes place, are hardly expert at dealing 
with corporate negotiators. "In a place like Yosemite, a guy with a forestry 
degree like I have is suddenly dealing with very big and complex business 
issues," said Binnewies, who granted Curry Co. requests for new profit-making 
services when he was Yosemite superintendent from 1979 to 1986. "We pride 
ourselves in thinking we can do the job, but dealing with multimillion-dollar 
corporations should suggest that some good business expertise on the Park 
Service's side of the table would be helpful." 
</P>
<P>
The first master plan debacle prompted the Park Service to hold public hearings 
in the late 1970s to develop a new blueprint for Yosemite. More than $1 million 
was spent, tens of thousands of people testified and Park Service staff pored 
over draft after draft. The Curry Co. had the opportunity to make its case but 
did not exercise inordinate influence. The public, it turned out, wanted less 
development, not more, in Yosemite Valley but tended to favor keeping 
accommodations at their current level. 
</P>
<P>
Nevertheless, the new master plan, completed in 1980 and approved by the Park 
Service hierarchy in Washington, called for reducing the number of guest rooms 
in the Valley by 17%. The plan also sought to remove about 370 Park Service and 
Curry Co. buildings and minimize traffic. Visitors without overnight 
reservations would be required to leave their cars at the periphery of the park 
and enter by bus. "The result will be that visitors can step into Yosemite and 
find nature uncluttered by piecemeal stumbling blocks of commercialism, 
machines and fragments of suburbia," the plan promised. 
</P>
<P>
As is the case with many national park master plans, which are not guaranteed 
funding, this one barely got off the ground: Fewer than 75 Park Service and 
Curry Co. buildings came down. The company says the Park Service never formally 
asked it to remove more. Chapman blames resistance from the Curry Co. "You 
would just be worn down over time," he said. "They would stall and put you off. 
You would come back to them, and they would find reasons to throw up a 
roadblock." And without money to reimburse the Curry Co. for buildings it owned 
by contract, Chapman said, "there was always the threat that they would take us 
to court." 
</P>
<P>
By 1986, Binnewies was reassigned and replaced by Jack Morehead, who had earned 
impressive conservationist credentials as superintendent of Everglades National 
Park in Florida. After three years at Yosemite, Morehead commissioned an 
"examination report," or status report, on the 1980 master plan. It argued that 
much of the plan, including the restrictions on accommodations, might no longer 
be realistic. The plan represented 10-year goals, he said, and he wanted the 
public to know why the objectives were not being met. 
</P>
<P>
But Morehead also had grown to consider Ed Hardy a "personal friend" while at 
Yosemite, and the relationship between the two men became a matter of much 
debate after the report was made public. Morehead and Hardy had lunch together 
once a week, often at the Ahwahnee, and Morehead seldom paid for his own meal. 
The two men and their wives dined at each other's homes. Morehead also joined 
Hardy, congressmen and other Curry Co. guests on Hardy's mule-pack trips. 
</P>
<P>
Morehead says that the friendship did not influence his decisions but that if 
he had to do it all over again, he would change one thing: appearances. He 
would have paid for his own meals with Hardy in front of the Ahwahnee waiters. 
</P>
<P>
Conservationists had paid little attention to Yosemite in the 1980s. "Yosemite 
wasn't a priority then," one of them said. But Morehead's report lit the fire 
again. Conservationists had assumed that the 1980 plan eventually would be 
enacted once funding became available, so the report stung like a broken 
promise. 
</P>
<P>
Just before the public outcry began, Morehead landed a promotion. He moved to 
Washington to oversee concession management, and Michael Finley, a park 
professional who was respected by conservationists, arrived in Yosemite as 
environmentalists were taking aim. 
</P>
<P>
JOE BOLAND GESTURED OUT over the valley from a curbside seat in front of 
Yosemite Lodge. He had to shout to be heard over the rumble of the 
smoke-belching bus idling a few feet away. "What would I like to see done?" he 
asked, his voice hostile. "I would like to see everyone and everything pushed 
out of here for at least 100 years until we get wise enough as a species to 
take care of this place." 
</P>
<P>
Boland, 45, is tall, slender and dead serious. He doesn't like to talk about 
the more likely possibility, that MCA and the Curry Co. will win the new 
contract in Yosemite in 1993. But he confesses to having another fantasy about 
just that prospect. In this fantasy, Boland, a tennis teacher who lives in a 
trailer in Mariposa, imagines that environmentalists become guerrillas, hide in 
the cliffs that surround Yosemite Valley and sneak down each night to attack 
Curry Co. holdings. 
</P>
<P>
Boland is one of three activists leading the charge against MCA. A veteran of 
the 1970s master plan wars, he brings historical perspective to the campaign 
and a sizable collection of documents about MCA's record in Yosemite. He 
considers the Curry Co. under MCA "the enemy," and in 1974 formed an informal 
group called Friends of Yosemite as a platform for speaking out about the park. 
</P>
<P>
Another longtime park-watcher, Dean Malley, joined the fight against MCA after 
the Morehead report was released. Perpetually reddened by the sun, with blond 
hair brushed to the side, Malley is an intense, 40-year-old, self-employed 
computer salesman in Sonora. He grew up in La Jolla and spent his summers in 
Yosemite camping, rock scrambling and riding his inflatable mattress down the 
Merced. Long active in his local Sierra Club, he responded to the examination 
report by establishing Coalition 94, a loosely knit group with preservation as 
its goal. 
</P>
<P>
MCA's most formidable opposition, however, came from Patricia Schifferle, a 
savvy, well-organized and well-placed activist. Schifferle, 39, was the top 
California representative of the Wilderness Society, a Harvard 
University-educated public administrator and former consultant to the state 
Assembly Transportation Committee. She is athletic-looking and enthusiastic, 
moving quickly and purposefully, the cane she acquired with a recent back 
injury failing to slow her momentum. 
</P>
<P>
When she saw the examination report, she immediately demanded a full-blown 
environmental review and the opportunity for extensive public participation. 
The Curry Co. responded just as quickly. It sent 93,000 mailers to former park 
guests, asking them to oppose any reduction in accommodations and to support 
the replacement of some tent cabins with motel units. Schifferle was incensed. 
"If nothing were done," she said, "the examination report could have sealed the 
fate for Yosemite." 
</P>
<P>
Although Schifferle, Boland and Malley are hard-pressed to admit it, there is 
no proof that MCA had triggered Morehead's report despite its advantages for 
the company. Still, the corporation became the target of the preservationists' 
wrath. They began to call for a new concession, one that would be willing to 
scale back accommodations and raze more buildings. 
</P>
<P>
It was principally Schifferle who matched action with the idea of a revolt to 
unseat MCA. Working with a San Francisco attorney who sat on the board of a 
Yosemite educational group, Schifferle and the Wilderness Society began to 
assemble a nonprofit board of directors to compete with MCA for the Yosemite 
contract. This board would include environmentalists, former Park Service 
employees and businessmen with experience in concession management. Boland and 
Malley saw the advantages of a united front and joined forces with Schifferle. 
</P>
<P>
If the Wilderness Society group was successful, it would enact the 1980 master 
plan. At the very least, the group, called the Yosemite Restoration Trust, 
would ensure conservationists a seat at the negotiating table where they could 
influence the terms of the new contract. "It is a serious effort," Schifferle 
said. "You can't do it without seriously wanting to take over the contract. But 
much of the purpose here has been to put some public light on what has been a 
rather cozy process between the Park Service and MCA." 
</P>
<P>
She and other preservationists were encouraged when Michael Finley took over 
Yosemite in September, 1989. Tall and robust, with short, brown hair, Finley, 
44, had just finished three years as a superintendent in the controversial and 
ecologically threatened Everglades park, where environmentalists held him, as 
they had Morehead, in high regard. 
</P>
<P>
Finley played it cool at Yosemite. On the one hand, he made it clear to the 
activists that the examination report was neither his nor binding. He more or 
less ignored it. On the other hand, when the nonprofit Yosemite Assn. publicly 
condemned the report, Finley complained to its board of directors. As an 
educational organization subsidized by the Park Service, it had no business 
taking a political stand, Finley told the directors. The charter to operate in 
the park, he reminded them, could be revoked. 
</P>
<P>
The new superintendent also believed that the environmentalists were 
exaggerating what the master plan would do. "I keep hearing from Patty 
Schifferle of the Wilderness Society about making Yosemite natural," he 
complained last spring. "I just watched her on the "Today Show" this morning, 
and she was with the cameramen up here saying, 'This is a resort, this 
shouldn't be here.' " Even under the master plan, there would still be many 
buildings in Yosemite Valley. 
</P>

Having failed to find a strong ally in Finley, Schifferle, Boland and Malley 
took their case to the public. The trio's campaign to oust MCA became a battle 
for the hearts and minds of Yosemite lovers. The conservationists pored over 
what little public documentation existed about MCA's park revenues and accused 
the corporation of profiteering. Park Service files were scoured. Every MCA 
deviation from the master plan -- even though approved by the Park Service -- 
was noted. Officials at the Interior Department and some members of Congress 
started talking about concession reform. A steady stream of news media traveled 
to Yosemite, and conservationists were ready for them. 
</P>
<P>
Typical of the conservationists' campaign was a tour given by Malley this 
summer for a visiting reporter. He drove into the woods next to the Ahwahnee 
Hotel to point out Curry Co. valets. They were parking luxury automobiles 
between pines and firs. He headed to a Curry Co. store to criticize the 
merchandise -- everything from shoes to centennial coffee mugs. At the Curry 
Co.'s ice rink, which the master plan said should be replaced with a portable 
rink in winter only, he stopped. He complained that the lights are so bright in 
winter that they dim the stars and that he can hear the rink's music until 10 
p.m. when he camps. 
</P>
<P>
Schifferle and Boland distrust MCA, but Malley seems downright anxiety-ridden. 
He has taken to keeping with him electronic equipment that he says can detect 
eavesdropping devices. "Since I am interfering with a billion-dollar contract," 
he said, "I assume at some point that they are going to throw some technology 
at me to find out what I am saying to people." 
</P>
<P>
Driving his truck through the valley under a light rain, he spotted a white 
jeep following him and shoved a transmission frequency counter out the door. 
"I've seen that jeep parked outside the Curry Co. headquarters," he confided. 
</P>
<P>
Yosemite employees sympathetic to the anti-MCA campaign share Malley's worries 
and add to them the fear that speaking out may jeopardize their jobs. They meet 
reporters in the protective darkness of the park's woods and spill tales of the 
concession's domination of the Park Service. One staff member is known as "Deep 
Valley." 
</P>
<P>
A book called "Dark Victory: Ronald Reagan, MCA and the Mob," by Dan E. Moldea, 
has sold a lot of copies around Yosemite, and Malley is one of its devotees. 
"It has pictures -- I'll show you," he said, seated behind the wheel of his 
truck. "It has people with blown-up vehicles and stuff and bullets to their 
heads sitting in front of cars." 
</P>
<P>
There is no evidence that Malley or anyone else is being followed or physically 
threatened or that frequency counters are necessary. The Curry Co. spokesman 
dismisses such notions as "absurd." 
</P>
<P>
Some conservationists, removed from the action in the park, have watched the 
struggle with dismay. Environmentalist David Brower, for instance, is largely 
satisfied with MCA's performance at Yosemite. The Curry Co. recently hosted a 
reception for Brower at the Ahwahnee, and Brower has been a guest at one of 
Hardy's parties. 
</P>
<P>
At the age of 78, the eminent environmentalist appreciates comfortable 
accommodations and sees no need to reduce them. Nor do the crowds bother him. 
"I can be alone in Yosemite Valley in 10 minutes," he said. "I know where to be 
alone -- but my lips are sealed." 
</P>
<P>
Brower believes that environmental groups cannot be watchdogs of parks if they 
are running a concession, and he objects to the Wilderness Society's MCA 
contract challenge. Paul Pritchard, president of the National Parks and 
Conservation Assn., agrees. Instead, he said, environmental groups should be 
questioning the need for concessions at all in the parks. History may support 
Brower and Pritchard's view of the inherent conflict. Alfred Runte, author of 
"Yosemite: The Embattled Wilderness," wrote that Ansel Adams lost his 
preservationist attitude toward Yosemite after he and his wife inherited a 
photographic studio in the valley. The photographer, who had once opposed 
camping in the valley, was by the 1970s declaring that as many people as 
possible should visit " 'one of the greatest shrines of the world.' " The Ansel 
Adams Gallery, Runte wrote, had become the 
"preservationist-turned-businessman's bridge to his growing and adoring 
public." 
</P>
<P>
THE FIGHT OVER Yosemite Valley has already produced some changes. Interior 
Secretary Lujan has begun to overhaul both the concession contracting process 
and the terms of the deal. The government's cut of the profits is virtually 
certain to be higher than .75%, and Lujan promises to use outside consultants 
to help the Park Service forge better deals in future negotiations. He also 
wants the federal government gradually to buy the buildings now held by park 
concessioners, including the Curry Co. 
</P>
<P>
According to the Park Service, any rival bidder for the Yosemite contract would 
have to be able to purchase MCA's interest in its physical plant in Yosemite, 
which by some estimates is worth as much as $200 million to $300 million. 
"Unless the Department of Interior is able to own those buildings, the 
concessioner still has control of the park," a Lujan spokesman said. In the 
park itself, Superintendent Finley is still working at playing a mediator's 
role. "The thing I am trying to do is defuse the rhetoric, all the torpedoes 
flying back and forth," he said, seated in his office in Yosemite Village. 
</P>
<P>
He betrays irritation at the ruckus raised by the preservationists. Their 
constant nattering about the park's failure to enact the master plan or 
vigilantly oversee the Curry Co. has frustrated him. "The point is," he says, 
"that even the 1980 master plan did not envision Yosemite returning to 
wilderness or a natural setting. It called for reduction." Why can't the 
environmentalists focus on threats from air pollution instead of what kind of 
coffee mugs the Curry Co. sells? he asks. 
</P>
<P>
Despite his irritation, Finley has heeded the criticism about his predecessor. 
There will be no more dinners with the concessioner at the Ahwahnee -- Finley 
refuses to socialize with Hardy. The new superintendent also appears intent 
about fulfilling more of the goals of the master plan: The Park Service 
announced in August that it will soon raze 20 park buildings. Finley, moreover, 
seems reluctant to allow the concession in the next contract to set aside more 
rooms for tour-bus travelers. "Due to the bus roar in Yosemite, my home in 
Yosemite Valley is noisier than it was in the Miami suburbs," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Over at the Curry Co., Ed Hardy seems satisfied with Finley's decisions so far. 
Hardy, who refers to Finley as "my sixth superintendent" -- says Finley is 
better at the job than his predecessors, even better than Morehead, who 
considered Hardy a friend. "He is articulate and understands the balance of 
preservation and use, and I don't believe he is tainted by any side of the 
issue," Hardy said. 
</P>
<P>
In the wake of the controversy, however, Hardy is not happy with the way 
outsiders may be viewing his company. Every time the 100th anniversary of 
Yosemite comes up, it seems the contract challenge comes up, too, and with it, 
preservationists' gripes about MCA. "I'm sick of being bashed," Hardy grumbled. 
</P>
<P>
As he did at the beginning of his tenure at the park, Hardy is spending time 
putting out image brush fires. Reporters who have covered the conflict at the 
park have learned to expect scathing letters from the Curry Co. to their 
editors and publishers. In a form of subtle intimidation, the company provides 
copies of these letters to other reporters in the park to cover the dispute. In 
one such letter the Curry Co. complained about a story in the Wall Street 
Journal. Meanwhile, a Park Service spokesman called the reporter to compliment 
the story's fairness. 
</P>
<P>
For their part, the preservationists are simply trying to keep the planning 
process for the contract challenge on track. This month, their side was dealt a 
setback. Schifferle resigned after the Wilderness Society reassigned her from 
director to senior counsel. She said the Park Service -- unhappy with any 
attacks on its image as park caretakers -- complained to the Wilderness Society 
about her role in the contract challenge. 
</P>
<P>
The Wilderness Society strongly denied this and pledged a strong campaign at 
Yosemite. But to conservationists close to the action, Schifferle's loss was 
significant. "She was the only person from the mainstream environmental 
movement willing to call a spade a spade," Boland said. 
</P>
<P>
Still, the Wilderness Society has forged ahead without Schifferle. With its 
board of directors in place, the Yosemite Restoration Trust began to search for 
an executive director. In the coming months, it will initiate studies to help 
it make an effective bid for the contract. Financing will be sought, including 
foundation money for the trust itself. 
</P>
<P>
In the meantime, Yosemite's centennial is under way. It will begin tomorrow 
with a low-key ceremony in a meadow in Yosemite Valley. Dignitaries will gather 
for speeches, an actor will portray John Muir in a short monologue and the 6th 
U.S. Army Band will perform. There also will be a moment of silence -- even 
nearby traffic will be stopped -- during which guests will be asked to envision 
Yosemite before people came. 
</P>
<P>
And when the party ends, the tug-of-war at Yosemite will undoubtedly resume. 
The spotlight on MCA has caused an examination of the concessioner-Park Service 
partnership, with all its inherent strains. In the wake of the Yosemite battle, 
there are those who are no longer sure "partnership" is even the right term: 
"There should be no more than a landlord and tenant relationship," says former 
Park Service Director George Hartzog, "and we don't call that a partnership." 
</P>
<P>
Finley, who faces the challenge of working out this relationship every day, 
expresses confidence that he will call the shots in the park. Yet there are 
echoes in Yosemite Valley, and they bounce back and forth between the offices 
of Hardy and Finley. Who is adopting whose words is not always clear, but the 
two men tend to say the same things when they describe park matters. Buses are 
not "the panacea," according to Hardy. "Buses are not the panacea," Finley 
says. The superintendent even lets Hardy frame the park-concession relationship 
for him. "As Ed says," says Finley, "we are the senior partner." 
</P>
<P>
ON BUSY DAYS in Yosemite Valley, it is possible to forget that you are in a 
national park. Conversations are drowned out by passing buses. Open-air tour 
trams glide by, and the Curry Co. guide speaking into the bullhorn is heard by 
more than just the visitors neatly sandwiched on the tram's benches. 
</P>
<P>
Lines snake everywhere, in the stores and in the cafeterias. Waiting for a 
sit-down meal can take as long as an hour and 45 minutes. A loudspeaker alerts 
diners waiting outside: "Gordon party of two, in the Mountain Room Broiler," 
"Anderson party of four, in the Four Seasons." If you weary of waiting and call 
over to Yosemite Village for a pizza, you would not be the first to ask if the 
Curry Co. pizza stand delivers. It doesn't, but the point is that the valley 
can feel so urban that delivery would not be out of place. 
</P>
<P>
But there also are times, even in summer, when Yosemite Valley loses its urban 
feeling, when the magic of the valley can still exist and the struggle to 
preserve it doesn't seem futile. A spate of bad weather on the heels of a 
holiday weekend can thin the crowds and slow the pace. On such a rare summer 
weekend, the lines are short, the waits tolerable. 
</P>
<P>
Man is in every scene, but he does not ruin it. A ragged coyote wanders among 
picnic tables, and a young boy watches it fearlessly. "Here, boy; here, boy," 
the child beckons. The animal, scavenging for food, ignores him. A man drinking 
a cup of coffee stands with his young daughter on his shoulders at the edge of 
the Merced and watches the river flow by. On a trail leaving the valley and 
winding up to Glacier Point, the hikers are few and far between. At dusk, only 
occasional couples pass on the pathways that wind through the meadows. Deer 
graze in the grass; a gray squirrel scampers across the path. The lower part of 
the granite walls are brown and gray in the approaching darkness, the upper 
halves still bathed in a pink glow from the declining sun. 
</P>
<P>
At times like these, you are reminded of what Yosemite Valley once was and, 
while the enduring struggle continues, what it still has the power to be. 
</P>
