Communist-ruled Mongolia will hold multi-party parliamentary elections Sunday, 
a first in the country's history. The Mongolian People's Revolutionary Party 
(MPRP), as the Communists are officially known, will face off against an 
opposition coalition. The elections culminate eight months of dramatic 
political liberalization in the landlocked nation of 2 million people. . . . 
Political change is paired with growing openness to the world. Secretary of 
State James A. Baker III is due to visit Ulan Bator on Aug. 2-5 for talks on 
bilateral relations, including a plan to dispatch U.S. Peace Corps volunteers 
to Mongolia.

<P>
The System: 
</P>
<P>
Voters will elect representatives to five-year terms in Mongolia's supreme 
legislative body, the 430-member People's Great Hural. Members of provincial 
and local governmental bodies will also be chosen. Preliminary elections were 
held last Sunday to narrow the number of candidates to two in each district. 
The Great Hural, which convenes once a year, elects the president of Mongolia. 
It also will establish a routinely functioning legislature, the 53-member Small 
Hural, based partly on a party preference vote that will be included in 
Sunday's ballot. 
</P>
<P>
At Stake: 
</P>
<P>
The elections mark a key step in the transformation of Mongolia's political and 
economic life toward a system closer to Western-style democratic capitalism. 
Even the opposition seems to view the elections primarily as a part of this 
process, rather than as a chance to take control of the government. 
</P>
<P>
The elections "will become a basis for (the) soonest switching over to a full 
market economy, parliamentary democracy and promotion of pluralism of views," 
predicted Sanjaasuren Zorig, head of the Mongolian Democratic Assn., the first 
and most prominent opposition group in the country. 
</P>
<P>
The elections also should help Mongolia's moves to loosen its extremely close 
69-year-old ties with the Soviet Union and to develop closer relations with 
rich industrialized democracies. President Punsalmaagiyn Ochirbat, in a May 
speech to the Great Hural, said reform of Mongolia's political structure is 
important not only for the country's "socioeconomic and cultural renewal" but 
also for its "foreign policy construction." 
</P>
<P>
Background: 
</P>
<P>
Change in Mongolia reflects the rapid liberalization that has swept the old 
Soviet bloc. Rapid democratization began here in December, when dissidents 
twice held demonstrations in Ulan Bator. Protests escalated in January and 
February. The ruling party responded with a conciliatory stance, pledging a 
gradual transition toward a multi-party democracy. 
</P>
<P>
Opposition parties complained in June that proposed election procedures were 
unfair and threatened a boycott. But after winning concessions, they said they 
would participate. 
</P>
<P>
Ochirbat, in a July interview with the MPRP-controlled newspaper Unen, said 
that "all existing political parties lack experience, which leads to some 
errors and mistakes during the election campaign." He called for "flexibility 
and mutual dialogue in the settlement of any problems or disagreements 
concerning the elections." 
</P>
<P>
Parties: 
</P>
<P>
The Mongolian People's Revolutionary Party established the world's second 
Communist state after coming to power in 1921 with Soviet backing. It dropped 
the word "communism" from its party constitution in April, setting the new goal 
of building "democratic humane socialism." It now favors market-oriented 
economic reforms. In a concession to the opposition, the MPRP says it is 
suspending the political activity of its branches in army, militia and state 
security organs from mid-July until after formation of the new Great Hural and 
Small Hural. 
</P>
<P>
The Mongolian Democratic Party, the country's first opposition party, was 
created in February, even before such action was legal. Its parent organization 
is the Mongolian Democratic Assn. The MDP has called for the ruling party and 
opposition to work together to "speed up economic, political and social 
development . . . and take better care of the poor, the handicapped and those 
victimized in years of repression." 
</P>
<P>
The National Progress Party was established primarily by a group of young 
economists. "Our party's major goal is to support progressive national 
traditions in close combination with every progressive idea appearing in the 
world," Dagvasurengiyn Ganbold, chairman of the party, said in a June interview 
with Radio Ulan Bator. "The Mongols since ancient times have respected and 
advocated free ideology, and there was no tradition of repressing people of 
different ideology." The party wishes to restore this spirit of tolerance, he 
said. 
</P>
<P>
Other parties contesting the elections include the Social Democratic Party, the 
Party of Free Labor and the environmentalist Green Party. All but the Party of 
Free Labor are cooperating in an opposition coalition. 
</P>
<P>
Personalities: 
</P>
<P>
The mastermind of the opposition movement has been Mongolian Democratic Assn. 
leader Zorig, whose background paradoxically is as a scholar of Marxism. A 
colorless speaker, Zorig, 27, who is half Russian, makes up in organizational 
talent what he lacks in charisma. 
</P>
<P>
President Ochirbat formerly headed the ministries of fuel and power, and of 
geology. The MPRP is headed by Gombojavyn Ochirbat (no relation to the 
president), a former trade union president and head of party ideology who faced 
official criticism in the early 1980s. He was elected party chief in March, 
only days after returning to Ulan Bator from two years spent in Prague. 
</P>
<P>
Outlook: 
</P>
<P>
The Mongolian Democratic Party claims that polls show its support in some major 
cities at about 40% to 50%. But the MPRP says it has majority support among 
urbanites. The ruling party is presumed to have a strong edge in the 
countryside, where livestock herders are unfamiliar with democratic procedures 
and have only limited knowledge about the opposition. 
</P>
<P>
MPRP officials, in a concession made early this month, promised that even if 
their party dominates the election, the opposition will be given some positions 
in the new Council of Ministers. 
</P>
<P>
"It is quite understandable that newly set up political parties cannot compete 
with the MPRP that has been ruling the country for 70 years now, in terms of 
membership, finance and reputation," National Progress Party Chairman Ganbold 
said in a June interview with Radio Ulan Bator. "This year's elections must 
become a step forward in the development of democracy in the genuine sense. 
Herein lies the main significance of the participation of the democratic 
forces."
