The Ventura Unified School District has been chosen to participate in a 
statewide pilot program that officials hope will take the belch out of school 
buses, the sting out of fuel costs and better ensure the safety of California's 
schoolchildren. 
</P>
<P>
The Ventura district was one of 11 chosen for the first phase of the California 
Energy Commission's demonstration program, which was designed largely to test 
alternative fuels. 
</P>
<P>
The district is to receive eight high-tech diesel buses and four 
methanol-powered buses by June, 1990, replacing 12 older buses built before 
federal safety standards took effect in 1977. 
</P>
<P>
The district will get the buses, valued at $123,000 each, free under the 
program. 
</P>
<P>
According to district transportation director Steve Penney, the new diesel 
buses, equipped with state-of-the-art features such as computerized fuel 
injection, will be used as an experimental control to test the efficiency of 
the methanol-fueled buses. 
</P>
<P>
"We'll be testing them one against the other for emissions and fuel economy," 
Penney said. 
</P>
<P>
He said the district next spring will apply for inclusion in the program's 
second phase, which will entail experimenting with other alternative fuels, 
including natural gas. 
</P>
<P>
A clean-burning fuel made from natural gas or coal, methanol has been used for 
more than a year by Ventura County in a fleet of eight specially equipped Ford 
Escorts. 
</P>
<P>
Their use has reduced pollutants, said Chuck Thomas, an air quality specialist 
with the county Air Pollution Control District. 
</P>
<P>
"We've had no troubles with the methanol components," said Thomas. "They work 
just fine." 
</P>
<P>
Thomas said the cars' only drawback is that they require special refueling 
centers. Additionally, methanol provides just half the mileage per gallon of 
conventional gasoline. 
</P>
<P>
There currently are two methanol refueling sites in the county -- one in 
Ventura, the other in Simi Valley. 
</P>
<P>
The first two phases of the program will cost $60 million. It has already been 
appropriated from the federal government's Petroleum Violation Escrow Account, 
a fund created from fines paid by oil companies that overcharged their 
customers. An additional $40 million for the third phase has yet to be 
approved.
