In the opinion of Bruce M. Cordell, a physicist who studies advanced space 
systems planning for General Dynamics' San Diego-based Space Systems Division, 
President Bush's call this week for a manned mission to Mars was heavy on 
rhetoric and light on substance. 
</P>
<P>
"You could argue that this was the most minimal statement that a president 
could make" and still support a manned Mars mission, Cordell said Friday. "But 
it would be unfair to characterize (Bush's initiative) as being totally devoid 
of leadership." 
</P>
<P>
Several Democratic congressmen have done just that: One lambasted Bush for a 
proposal that contained "no money, no timetable and no plan." Another 
legislator, mindful of the program's multibillion-dollar price tag, quipped 
that "there is no such thing as a free launch." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Faced With Lunar Landing Anniversary 
</P>
<P>
Cordell on Friday speculated that Bush "was faced with the 20th anniversary of 
the lunar landing, and he wanted to make a public statement." Unfortunately, 
"NASA is simply not ready to unveil its detailed plan" for a Mars trip, 
according to Cordell. That detailed space plan won't be available until the 
early 1990s, said Cordell, a former physics professor who joined General 
Dynamics five years ago. 
</P>
<P>
Bush on Thursday used the 20th anniversary of Neil Armstrong's moonwalk to 
propose a three-pronged space program that includes an Earth-orbiting space 
station , a moon-based scientific station and a manned mission to Mars. 
</P>
<P>
Yet Bush's speech marked a milestone, despite its "bare-bones approach," 
Cordell said. "For the first time ever, an American president has publicly 
endorsed a manned Mars mission," he said. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Agnew Made Similar Proposal 
</P>
<P>
Bush's endorsement of a Mars mission came 20 years after then-Vice President 
Spiro T. Agnew, who headed a space task force, made a similar proposal, Cordell 
said. "Needless to say, that got swamped in the Vietnam War and Watergate." 
</P>
<P>
Cordell believes that Americans will look past the enormous -- but as yet, 
undetermined cost -- and embrace what Bush described as a "journey into 
tomorrow." 
</P>
<P>
"I find tremendous interest in the prospect of humans exploring the solar 
system, particularly in Mars colonization," said Cordell, who regularly talks 
about space missions "before all types of groups -- from kids in school to 
military groups and Rotary clubs." 
</P>
<P>
Although opponents will balk at the cost, Cordell argued that "a Mars program 
is not a budget-busting program . . . it's not something that will bankrupt the 
U. S. Rather, it's an investment in the future of the United States and of 
global civilization." 
</P>
<P>
A manned Mars mission would be "the greatest human adventure of our time," 
Cordell said in a speech earlier this month during an American Institute of 
Aeronautics and Astronautics conference in Washington. 
</P>
<P>
The proposed Mars mission offers "important new scientific knowledge, a 
compelling stimulus for technological growth, potentially great economic return 
. . . a chance for improved international relations, and a profound opportunity 
for the evolution of human civilization and consciousness into the cosmos," 
Cordell said during that speech. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Challenging, Risky Mission 
</P>
<P>
Cordell's grand description of a Mars mission's benefits doesn't ignore the 
fact that a manned Mars mission would be expensive, technologically challenging 
and risky. 
</P>
<P>
To limit risk, Cordell cautioned against turning the Mars mission into a "space 
race" between the United States and Russia. That warning echoed former 
astronaut Sally Ride's 1987 statement that a space race to Mars could 
compromise astronaut safety. 
</P>
<P>
Ride in the fall will become director of the of the California Space Institute 
on the UC San Diego campus. Ride has repeatedly urged national policy planners 
to establish a permanent lunar research outpost and to develop a coordinated, 
long-term space exploration plan. 
</P>
<P>
"If it's not developed, the space program will be fragmented," Ride said in a 
recent interview. 
</P>
<P>
Cordell suggested that "a 'moon-first' philosophy . . . (would be) more 
consistent with the incremental increases in mission difficulty and risk that 
were evident during the Mercury, Gemini and Apollo programs." 
</P>
<P>
If the United States does mount a Mars mission, he said, there would be several 
challenges: 
</P>
<P>
* Medical experts must deal with the effects of "microgravity" upon astronauts' 
bones, muscles and cell tissue during the two-to-four-year Mars mission. 
</P>
<P>
* Waste recycling would be critical during a Mars mission because space 
limitations would prohibit astronauts from stocking and maintaining an adequate 
supply of air, water and food. 
</P>
<P>
* Doctors are studying the effects of radiation, which will be 100 times 
heavier than levels encountered during Apollo lunar missions. 
</P>
<P>
* During the years-long adventure, astronauts will face all of the leading 
causes of death -- cancer, heart attack, suicide, trauma, etc. -- facing their 
fellow earthlings. 
</P>
<P>
* Social scientists also are studying how a highly trained group would react to 
an "isolated and confined" space ship. They also are studying "the slightly 
touchy subject of sex in space" because there is a "high likelihood of 
mixed-gender crews," Cordell said.
