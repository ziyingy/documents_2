Juvenile court judge today denied permission for 14-year-old Richard Hubler to 
attend the funeral of the 12-year-old sister he is accused of murdering. 
</P>
<P>
Hubler was arrested last Thursday and charged with the shooting death of his 
sister, Gema Marie Hubler, in their Anaheim Shores home.

The girl died Monday at UCI Medical Center after being removed from a life 
support system.

The blond, lanky Hubler remained in handcuffs during a detention hearing this 
morning at which Orange County Juvenile Court Judge C. Robert Jameson explained 
the charges against him. Hubler will be tried as a juvenile. If convicted of 
murder with a firearm he could be held by the California Youth Authority until 
he is 25.

The judge denied without elaboration a request by Hubler's attorney, Deputy 
Public Defender Sharon Petrosino to permit Hubler to leave Juvenile Hall to 
attend Gema's funeral on Friday.

Deputy Dist. Atty. Marty Enquist said Hubler was on probation for another 
offense at the time of the shooting and should be kept in custody until his 
trial.

"He has committed past acts of a violent nature, and the violence in this case 
certainly speaks for itself," Enquist said.
