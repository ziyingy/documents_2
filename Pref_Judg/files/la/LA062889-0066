Remnants of Tropical Storm Allison moved into eastern Texas and western 
Louisiana, still dumping heavy rain and triggering thunderstorms after hitting 
the Houston area with more than 10 inches of rain. Downpours flooded homes and 
streets, forcing at least 800 people into Red Cross shelters. At least two 
fatalities were blamed on the storm, which was downgraded to a tropical 
depression in the morning. Harris County Sheriff's Department divers pulled a 
man's body from rain-swollen Spring Creek. On Monday, a traffic death in the 
Beaumont area was attributed to the storm. In southwestern Louisiana, police 
reported that a tornado at Hackberry damaged roofs and destroyed a mobile home.
