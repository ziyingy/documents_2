European Community environment ministers Thursday agreed on a surprise pact to 
virtually eliminate household gases used in refrigerators and spray cans that 
are destroying the Earth's protective ozone layer. 
</P>
<P>
A community spokesman said the ministers have agreed to eliminate 
chlorofluorocarbon (CFC) production and consumption by the year 2000 and to 
impose an 85% cut as soon as possible. 
</P>
<P>
In Washington, Environmental Protection Agency Administrator William K. Reilly 
called on the White House to adopt a policy seeking to end the use of 
ozone-depleting chemicals by the end of the century. (Story, Page 15.) 
</P>
<P>
"This is a quantum leap forward," Lord Caithness, a senior official in the 
British Environment Ministry, told reporters. The ministers had originally 
expected to agree on an 85% cut by the end of the century. 
</P>
<P>
The agreement would apply to CFCs covered by a treaty signed in Montreal in 
1987, but this excluded a number of other CFCs as well as environmentally 
dangerous halon gases used in fire-fighting equipment. 
</P>
<P>
About 40 countries, including the United States, agreed at Montreal to halve 
the production of CFC production by 1998. Diplomats said the 12-nation European 
Community wanted to take the lead in pushing the world toward total cuts. 
</P>
<P>
"It's a global problem," said French Environment Minister Brice Lalonde. "It's 
important to get the rest of the world behind us as the EC only accounts for 
half the problem." 
</P>
<P>
The European Community produces 400,000 metric tons of CFCs a year out of the 
world's total output of 1.1 million tons. 
</P>
<P>
Environmentalists say it is vital to eliminate CFC and halon production as soon 
as possible because damage already inflicted on the ozone layer will take 
decades to reverse. 
</P>
<P>
"No delay can be afforded. Depletion of the planet's protective ozone layer is 
an unprecedented global threat to life on Earth," the Greenpeace 
environmentalist organization said in a statement.

London Conference Set 
</P>
<P>
British Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher is staging a 100-nation conference on 
the ozone layer in London next week. Diplomats say a major objective is to 
persuade major producers such as India and China to at least sign the Montreal 
protocol. 
</P>
<P>
"We are talking about millions of people who have refrigerators stuffed with 
CFCs which will be exploded into the atmosphere when the fridges are thrown 
away," one diplomat said. 
</P>
<P>
Signatories of the Montreal accord will meet in Helsinki in May to consider 
ways of toughening the agreement. 
</P>
<P>
Some developing countries have been reluctant to agree to cuts for fear their 
budding industries will suffer and make them rely on the West for CFC 
substitutes. 
</P>
<P>
CFCs are used as coolants in refrigerators and air-conditioning systems, in 
some spray cans, and for cleaning micro-electronic circuits. 
</P>
<P>
Scientists blame the release of CFCs into the atmosphere for the depletion of 
the ozone layer, which helps shield the Earth from the sun's harmful 
ultra-violet rays. Unfiltered, the rays can cause skin cancer and damage plant 
life. 
</P>
<P>
CFCs are also branded as a major cause of the "greenhouse effect," or heating 
up of the Earth's atmosphere. Scientists say this could change weather patterns 
with disastrous consequences over large parts of the globe. 
</P>

Some Compounds Banned 
</P>
<P>
Several countries, including the United States, have banned the use of the 
compounds in aerosol propellants.

Over the Antarctic, an ozone hole -- an area where ozone has been seriously 
depleted -- is worsening, according to the British government's Stratospheric 
Ozone Review Group. The group reported that ozone concentration was reduced by 
more than 95% in some areas. 
</P>
<P>
An international expedition warned in February that the atmosphere over the 
Arctic region is also primed for a large destruction of ozone.

restaurants are the first to be heavily affected by the worldwide campaign 
against CFCs. Business, Page 1.
