The validity of so-called "genetic fingerprinting" went on trial here Monday as 
Orange County prosecutors sought to become the first in California to use a 
criminal suspect's genetic makeup as evidence in court. 
</P>
<P>
"It's very clear that individuals are genetically unique," Dr. Oliver A. Ryder, 
a scientist with the San Diego Zoo, testified at a hearing on the admissibility 
of genetic evidence in criminal proceedings. 
</P>
<P>
But in more than three hours of intense questioning, the defense attorney for 
Danny Harris, accused of 46 counts of rape, sexual molestation and burglary, 
sought to refute that theory by showing potential inaccuracies in the testing 
and interpretation of DNA (deoxyribonucleic acid). 
</P>
<P>
The hearing was the first in Orange County to explore controversial legal 
questions surrounding genetic fingerprinting -- a new practice seen as a 
scientific boon by prosecutors and a dangerous and unreliable precedent by 
defense attorneys. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
2nd Round of Testimony 
</P>
<P>
Lawyers in the Harris case are to return July 24 to begin a second round of 
testimony before Superior Court Judge William R. Froeberg. The judge ultimately 
must decide whether prosecutors can offer at Harris' upcoming trial genetic 
evidence that purportedly links the 39-year-old Buena Park man to about 18 
rapes and a series of other violent crimes around the county. 
</P>
<P>
First devised in England four years ago, the process of genetic fingerprinting 
uses samples of blood, semen or body tissue to establish an individual's 
genetic code or DNA pattern, a blueprint for all living organisms. Backers of 
the process maintain that, with the exception of identical twins, each 
individual has a unique genetic pattern. 
</P>
<P>
Genetic fingerprinting, considered by prosecutors more reliable and readily 
available than standard fingerprints in identifying perpetrators of sexual 
assaults and violent crimes, has gained only limited acceptance in a few courts 
around the nation. And it has never been allowed into evidence in California. 
</P>
<P>
But backed by a strong endorsement in January from state Atty. Gen. John K. Van 
de Kamp, local prosecutors in Orange, Ventura and Alameda counties all now are 
seeking to introduce genetic evidence in pending criminal cases, according to 
Orange County Deputy Dist. Atty. Dennis D. Bauer. 
</P>
<P>
"If we're successful in this (Harris) case in getting (genetic fingerprinting) 
into evidence, it'll certainly make it that much easier the next time around," 
said Bauer, explaining the precedent-setting importance of the case. 
</P>
<P>
Indeed, the Orange County Sheriff-Coroner's Department already is making plans 
to set up its own genetic fingerprinting laboratory. Only four now exist in the 
country. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
'A Tremendous Tool' 
</P>
<P>
Larry Ragle, director of forensic sciences, said Monday that the Sheriff's 
Department department has now raised about $45,000 from the private sector for 
the project. That is far short of the $200,000 needed to start the lab by the 
end of the year, but Ragle said he is hopeful that the Board of Supervisors may 
approve additional funding next month. 
</P>
<P>
"This (genetic fingerprinting) would be a tremendous tool for us to have in our 
investigations," Ragle said in an interview. 
</P>
<P>
In the meantime, however, county officials face stiff opposition from some 
members of the scientific and legal defense communities who assert that 
prosecutors are trying to rush an unreliable process into action. 
</P>
<P>
At Monday's hearing in the Harris case, defense attorney John D. Barnett sought 
to show that the genetic fingerprinting process is riddled with the potential 
for erroneous results. 
</P>
<P>
He also challenged the ability of Dr. Ryder -- a vertebrate geneticist who has 
worked extensively with DNA testing in studying wildlife at the San Diego Zoo 
but is not a forensic scientist -- to testify adequately on the subject. 
</P>
<P>
Assessing Ryder's testimony, Barnett said later: "There's simply insufficient 
scientific agreement on the ability of life codes to predict matches (between a 
genetic pattern and an individual) . . . These life codes are still under 
tremendous scrutiny. And right now, there's just too big a risk to take in a 
criminal case." 
</P>
<P>
Prosecutor Bauer acknowledged that, without the aid of the DNA evidence, he 
would be significantly hampered in trying to prove to a jury that Harris was 
responsible for a series of violent assaults in Anaheim, Fullerton, Santa Ana 
and Garden Grove dating back to 1985. 
</P>
<P>
Bauer would not elaborate on the genetic evidence in the Harris case. But 
Barnett said prosecutors have already indicated they plan to introduce semen 
specimens, which they claim conclusively tie Harris to at least five of the 18 
rapes for which he is charged.
