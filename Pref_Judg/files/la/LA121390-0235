A judge today threw out a murder charge against Dr. Jack Kevorkian in the death 
of an Alzheimer's disease patient who used his so-called suicide machine to 
take her life. 
</P>
<P>
Kevorkian turned and shook hands with a defense attorney after Clarkston 
District Judge Gerald McNally dismissed a first-degree murder charge in the 
death of Janet Adkins. 
</P>
<P>
McNally said prosecutors failed to prove Kevorkian planned and carried out 
Adkins' death June 4, adding that she, not Kevorkian, caused the death. 
</P>
<P>
McNally, noting Michigan has no specific law against assisting suicide, said it 
is up to the Legislature to clarify state law. 
</P>
<P>
Oakland County Chief Assistant Prosecutor Michael Modelski said he would 
appeal. 
</P>
<P>
McNally's ruling came after a two-day preliminary hearing to determine whether 
Kevorkian, of suburban Royal Oak, should stand trial. An outspoken advocate of 
the concept of doctor-assisted suicide for the terminally ill, Kevorkian has 
acknowledged hooking up Adkins to his machine, which put a lethal combination 
of drugs into her bloodstream after she pushed a button. 
</P>
<P>
The only alternatives available to the judge today were allowing the 
first-degree murder charge to go to trial or throwing it out. He could not 
substitute a lesser charge. 
</P>
<P>
On Wednesday, attorneys introduced a suicide note purportedly signed by Adkins, 
saying she freely chose to have Kevorkian help her commit suicide before she 
deteriorated further from Alzheimer's. 
</P>
<P>
"This is a decision taken in a normal state of mind and is freely considered," 
the note read. "I have Alzheimer's disease and I don't want it to progress any 
further. I don't want to put myself or my family through any more of this 
terrible disease." 
</P>
<P>
Adkins, 54, of Portland, Ore., died shortly after noon June 4. Later that day, 
Kevorkian let police search his van and seize his device before offering a 
statement about his role in Adkins' death.
