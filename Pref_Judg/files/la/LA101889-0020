When the stock market plunges 190 points in one day -- and 154 points in the 
span of 65 minutes -- on news of a bad deal gone awry, then something more than 
just that one deal is wrong. 
</P>
<P>
And when, after a weekend of international telephone calls and global 
handholding, the market rallies by 88 points, with blue chips climbing, more 
stocks losing than gaining overall and troubled junk bonds sinking -- then that 
same something is still wrong. 
</P>
<P>
What's wrong is no secret: We are living on borrowed time. These are days of 
phony, soap-bubble prosperity. Wall Street is America's Potemkin village. A 
paper-thin veneer of economic well-being covers over the deep structural 
problems of an economy burdened by too little real productivity and too much 
assumed debt. 
</P>
<P>
The gyrations of the stock market only serve to remind us of what we already 
know. That's why the slightest whiff of smoke can so easily spook the crowd to 
rush for the exits. 
</P>
<P>
As in any gambling casino, as long as the dice are hot, no one wants to be the 
first one out. And once they go cold, no one wants to be the last one in. Call 
Americans greedy if you will, but they are not stupid. And in our hearts and 
stomachs, we know the hard, uneasy truth: Our companies are not meeting the 
test of global competitiveness; our prosperity is borrowed, not earned. 
</P>
<P>
No one knows this better than American managers. According to the results of a 
survey of Harvard Business Review readers, which will appear in the 
November-December issue, top managers think that they are the cause of 
America's serious, and worsening, competitiveness problem. A full 96% say that 
the United States is falling behind our Asian rivals; of that number, 85% say 
the problem is getting worse, not better. Sixty-two percent say that their own 
industries have a competitiveness problem; of those, 90% say it is getting 
worse. 
</P>
<P>
One solution, endorsed by 74% of those readers surveyed, is a sliding scale on 
capital gains, with a rate as high as 50% on short-term investments and as low 
as zero on investments held for 10 years or more. 
</P>
<P>
The message is clear: We need to begin to remedy this out-of-whack market, 
fueled by takeover excesses, that both terrorizes companies and mortgages the 
country's economic future. 
</P>
<P>
It's a message that needs to extend beyond the borders of Wall Street. Before 
there even was a United States, there was a saying: "He that goes a-borrowing 
goes a-sorrowing." On the same day that the stock market rebounded enough for 
Americans to breathe a collective sigh of relief, the federal government missed 
the Gramm-Rudman-Hollings target for reducing the grotesquely bloated federal 
budget deficit, triggering an automatic across-the-board cut. The United States 
remains the world's largest debtor, depending on Japan, our arch-competitor, 
for 30% of our debt financing. The trade deficit with Japan defies the 
devaluation of the dollar against the yen -- while invisibly reducing 
American's standard of living. And as individuals the American people remain at 
the bottom of the list of savers among the industrialized nations of the world. 
</P>
<P>
We are consuming, borrowing and leveraging ourselves into competitive decline. 
The question is, if we all know what the problem is, when will we get to work 
on the remedy? Only after the Wall Street bubble finally bursts?
