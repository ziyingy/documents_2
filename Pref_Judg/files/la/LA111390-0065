<P>
The new mother studied the petal-pink baby sleeping beside her. 
</P>
<P>
"I call him my little miracle baby," Pam Baird said as she gazed at 8-week-old 
Nathan. 
</P>
<P>
Miracle indeed. 
</P>
<P>
Baird learned she had breast cancer not long after she learned she was 
pregnant. A nationally known oncologist urged an immediate abortion, then 
chemotherapy, as her best chance to survive. 
</P>
<P>
But after consulting more than a dozen specialists and a hospital ethics 
committee, Baird, like a growing number of pregnant women with cancer, decided 
to try to beat the disease -- and keep her baby. 
</P>
<P>
After a mastectomy, she began an aggressive course of chemotherapy. Every few 
weeks for most of her pregnancy, Baird reported to the Breast Care Center in 
Orange for injections of three anti-cancer drugs. Sometimes the powerful toxins 
made her vomit. Sometimes her blond curls fell out in handfuls. And sometimes 
-- scared for her baby and whether she would live to raise him -- all she could 
do was cry. 
</P>
<P>
But once a month, at the obstetrician's office, Baird was reassured by a 
black-and-white ultrasound image that showed a normal baby curled tightly 
inside her. 
</P>
<P>
In August, about five weeks early, Baird, 35, delivered a healthy, 5-pound, 
4-ounce boy. And this week, after finishing her last chemotherapy treatment, 
she and her husband, Rodger, celebrated with champagne. 
</P>
<P>
Baird's cancer is in remission, her current oncologist, David Margileth said, 
adding: "Here's a breast cancer patient I feel optimistic about. . . . Here's a 
woman I think will be around to raise her baby." 
</P>
<P>
Cancer is rare in pregnancy. A spokeswoman from the National Cancer Institute 
estimated that a malignancy occurs once in a thousand pregnancies. Breast 
cancer occurs once in every 3,500 pregnancies. (Cancer occurs in 36 out of 
1,000 people in the general population.) 
</P>
<P>
But when it does occur, it raises deep emotional and ethical questions for 
patients and their doctors. 
</P>
<P>
Should the mother-to-be have an abortion? Can she afford to delay cancer 
treatment until her baby is mature enough for delivery? Will the baby be harmed 
by chemotherapy? And will the mother live to care for her child? 
</P>
<P>
Twenty years ago, obstetricians and oncologists say, the standard 
recommendation when breast cancer occurred during pregnancy was an immediate 
abortion followed by mastectomy, radiation or chemotherapy. 
</P>
<P>
"In the past, an abortion had been recommended because the physician was 
uncomfortable about doing the treatments necessary for the mother for fear of 
injuring the fetus," said Dr. Frankie Ann Holmes, an assistant professor of 
medical oncology at M.D. Anderson Cancer Center in Houston. 
</P>
<P>
Today, some doctors still advocate abortion, but many others, including Holmes, 
are convinced that "you don't have to terminate." 
</P>
<P>
Radiation therapy is still considered harmful to the baby during all stages of 
pregnancy, and diagnostic abdominal X-rays have been associated with a high 
risk of leukemia after birth and other malignancies, some doctors report. 
</P>
<P>
But chemotherapy is a different story. 
</P>
<P>
Anti-cancer drugs can harm a baby during the first trimester when the heart, 
lungs and other organs are developing, medical articles have reported. But many 
of the same drugs can be used safely in the second and third trimester, Holmes, 
other oncologists and obstetricians have reported. 
</P>
<P>
At the Houston center, for instance, four breast cancer patients who had 
chemotherapy during pregnancy gave birth to normal babies this year, Holmes 
said. 
</P>
<P>
Still, some doctors admit they are uncomfortable when it comes to treating a 
pregnant woman for cancer. 
</P>
<P>
"Everybody kind of wrings their hands a little bit," said Dr. Robert Dillman, 
director of the Hoag Cancer Center in Newport Beach. "You really would like to 
get the fetus out." 
</P>
<P>
Margileth said that as Baird's pregnancy continued during the chemotherapy, "I 
tossed and turned about this. . . . Are we doing the right thing?" 
</P>
<P>
Margileth said he was also concerned that the normally happy experience of 
pregnancy had become a troubling one because of the cancer. "Here's this nice, 
3-to-4-month pregnant person that you just wish was shopping at South Coast 
Plaza for maternity clothes -- rather than getting adriamcyin (a chemotherapy 
agent)," Margileth said. 
</P>
<P>
Another concern: There is little data showing the long-term effects of 
chemotherapy on the child. Doctors say they simply don't know if the children 
will develop major problems later, such as infertility or leukemia. 
</P>
<P>
"We worry," said Dr. Gerald Gilchrist, chairman of pediatrics at the Mayo 
Clinic in Rochester, Minn., and of the American Academy of Pediatric's section 
on hematology and oncology. He added: "I don't think anyone knows." 
</P>
<P>
Baird noticed a lump in her right breast late last January, shortly after she 
had weaned her first son, Rory, now 17 months. Not long after that, a home 
pregnancy test and then a visit to Orange obstetrician Peter Anzaldo confirmed 
she was pregnant. 
</P>
<P>
Anzaldo suggested that the breast lump might be caused by a clogged milk duct, 
Baird said, but sent her to the Breast Center for a more detailed exam. 
</P>
<P>
A biopsy revealed a large, cancerous tumor. And in March, as Baird entered her 
second trimester, she had a mastectomy. That surgery showed her cancer had 
spread, invading one lymph node. Thus, the debate began in earnest. Should 
Baird abort? Should she continue her pregnancy and have chemotherapy? 
</P>
<P>
Baird wasn't sure what to do. "I had a 10-month-old son. I didn't want to die 
of breast cancer and leave him without a mother. . . . But I didn't want to 
have an abortion." 
</P>
<P>
Margileth began researching the issue, reading journal articles and contacting 
experts around the country. When his first contact, a renowned breast cancer 
specialist, emphatically recommended abortion, Baird spent a sleepless week in 
tears. 
</P>
<P>
But Margileth continued his inquiries, finding many oncologists who thought 
Baird could continue her pregnancy and start chemotherapy in the second 
trimester. 
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Baird's family and friends did their own research. Her brother, a 
medical student, sent copies of the few nationally reported studies on cancer 
in pregnancy. A friend, an oncology nurse, talked to experts at the National 
Institutes of Health. Her mother, who was also being treated for breast cancer, 
talked to doctors. 
</P>
<P>
And her husband, Rodger, an environmental chemist, asked the National Cancer 
Institute for a list of reports on pregnant women with cancer, then wrote to 
their authors asking how the babies had fared. 
</P>
<P>
The three doctors who responded offered good news: The babies were normal. 
Exulted Korean obstetrician Doo Sang Kim: "The bottom line is, 'The baby is now 
4 years and 5 months old and very healthy!' " Dr. Thomas G. Day Jr., director 
of gynecologic oncology at the James Graham Brown Cancer Center in Louisville, 
Ky, wrote: "I would like to reassure you that if chemotherapy is started after 
12 to 14 weeks, it is probably safe." 
</P>
<P>
The Bairds took one more step. At Anzaldo's suggestion, they asked St. Joseph 
Health System's perinatal bioethics committee to review their case. A 25-member 
committee that included doctors, a geneticist, a social worker and a priest 
listened as Anzaldo presented diverse opinions on what to do. The committee 
provided a forum for the issues, but no recommendation. 
</P>
<P>
Still, Rodger Baird called the meeting "cathartic. They didn't have any 
lectures for us. I spent half the time asking technical questions of the 
geneticist." 
</P>
<P>
But when it ended, the Bairds had come to a conclusion. Three days later, in 
her 15th week of pregnancy, Pam Baird received her first dose of chemotherapy. 
</P>
<P>
"The first time I had it, I just cried," she recalled. "It was scary" to know 
she was pregnant and yet three powerful, toxic drugs -- Adriamycin, Cytoxan and 
an agent called 5 Fu -- were coursing through her veins. 
</P>
<P>
Although she became nauseated and her hair fell out, the treatments never 
seemed to affect the baby, Baird said. Each month, "I just relied on Dr. 
Anzaldo that everything was all right. At each visit, he took a sonogram and I 
could see the baby move." 
</P>
<P>
Nathan Trilling Baird was born prematurely, by Cesarean section, after Baird's 
amniotic fluid began leaking in the eighth month of her pregnancy. Anzaldo does 
not believe the anti-cancer drugs caused the premature birth or affected the 
baby. 
</P>
<P>
The Bairds are thankful -- and still a little amazed -- that chemotherapy 
didn't hurt their son. "These are really nasty compounds," Rodger Baird said. 
"But the baby's definitely healthy." 
</P>
<P>
As for Pam Baird, she is busy caring for cuddly Nathan as well as trying to 
keep track of Rory, an active toddler. 
</P>
<P>
And she has some suggestions for other women who might find themselves pregnant 
and diagnosed with cancer. 
</P>
<P>
"Don't just rely on one doctor," she advised. "Take the initiative to research 
it. Don't just go on blind faith." 
</P>
<P>
The Bairds recently wrote to the three cancer specialists they had heard from, 
thanking them for their responses and reporting that mother and baby were fine. 
</P>
<P>
And Pam Baird said she was considering sending one more letter -- and a picture 
of Nathan -- to the prominent breast cancer specialist who had urged an 
abortion. The note will be brief, Baird said: "This is the baby we wouldn't 
have had." 
</P>
