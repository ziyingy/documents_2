Cooked Book: Washington author Adrian Havill is writing a book on sports empire 
builder Jack Kent Cooke, but Havill thinks the self-made, often-abrasive owner 
of the Washington Redskins may not cooperate on a book he doesn't control.

Rancho Resale: A New Hampshire real estate company plans to buy the former 
ranch-commune home of the late Indian guru Bhagwan Shree Rajneesh. Hanover 
Investment Corp. put down an undisclosed deposit on the 64,229-acre, $6-million 
central Oregon property, which the firm may turn into a health spa. The commune 
folded in 1985, after the Rolls Royce-loving Rajneesh was convicted of 
immigration fraud and deported to India, where he died in January.
