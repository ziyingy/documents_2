A wrongful-death lawsuit was filed in Superior Court on Thursday against former 
Deputy Dist. Atty. Charles Van Dusen, who pleaded guilty last December to 
vehicular manslaughter in the Sept. 2 drunk-driving crash in Valley Center that 
killed an Escondido woman.

<P>
The lawsuit was filed by Patricia F. Hodges, the sister and estate 
administrator for Carol Benson, the 45-year-old schoolteacher killed when her 
vehicle was struck head-on by Van Dusen on Cole Grade Road.

At the time of the crash, Van Dusen's blood-alcohol level was measured at 0.18% 
by a breath analyzer and 0.20 by a blood test. A blood alcohol level of 0.10 is 
considered legally intoxicated.

Van Dusen, 37, who resigned as a prosecutor shortly after the accident, was 
sentenced to six years in state prison. The suit against him seeks unspecified 
damages on behalf of Benson's estate.
