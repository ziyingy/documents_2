Tropical Storm Klaus weakened into a depression and moved further into the open 
Atlantic after unleashing wind and rain that left at least six dead and 1,500 
homeless in the northeastern Caribbean. Klaus briefly reached hurricane status 
Friday, but was downgraded to a tropical storm Saturday and then dropped to 
depression-level winds of 35 m.p.h. Sunday evening, forecasters in Miami said.
