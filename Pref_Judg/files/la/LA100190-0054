Researchers from UC Santa Barbara have been chosen by the National Science 
Foundation to establish a new Long-Term Ecological Research Site in Antarctica, 
the foundation announced last week. NSF currently has 17 such sites elsewhere 
to monitor slow changes in the environment, but this will be the first on the 
southernmost continent.

The $500,000-a-year project is designed to monitor the ice-dominated marine 
ecosystem at the bottom of the world. In the Austral winter, sea ice in the 
region grows to cover an area twice the size of the United States, but in the 
austral spring and summer, more than 80% of it melts. The ice has a major 
effect on ocean currents, penetration of the water by sunlight, and the growth 
of microorganisms.
