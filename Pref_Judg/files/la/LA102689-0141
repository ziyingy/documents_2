The Los Angeles city attorney's office filed a claim Wednesday for $18.5 
million from a fund set up by the Manville Corp. to pay some of the costs of 
asbestos cleanup in city buildings.

<P>
However, the city expects to recover only 12 to 40 cents on the dollar for its 
claim, filed as part of Manville's bankruptcy case in New York, according to 
Deputy City Atty. Marcia Haber Kamine. 
</P>
<P>
The city should receive the money within six to nine months, she said, and it 
will be used to help pay the costs of asbestos surveys and cleanups in city 
buildings that began in 1978.

<P>
Manville, which was a major producer of asbestos products, filed a bankruptcy 
petition in 1982 after it became the target of thousands of product liability 
lawsuits. Asbestos has been shown to be a potent carcinogen. 
</P>
<P>
Several special trusts for asbestos cleanup and compensation of victims have 
been established as part of the bankruptcy proceedings. The city funds would 
come from those trusts. 
</P>
<P>
A third of the city's claim involves the cost of removing asbestos from 
Department of Water and Power facilities, where the cancer-causing substance 
was once used extensively as insulation in power plants.
