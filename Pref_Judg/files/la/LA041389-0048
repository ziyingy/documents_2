District of Columbia Mayor Marion Barry called Wednesday for a summit meeting 
of regional political leaders to deal with the area's drug and drug-related 
violence problem. 
</P>
<P>
Barry also pledged that city officials will work closely with national drug 
chief William J. Bennett to make the region a leader in the war on drugs. 
</P>
<P>
"I plan to ask the (region's) chief executive officers to come together in a 
private setting to talk frankly and confidentially about our tactics," Barry 
said at the Metropolitan Washington Council of Governments, a regional body of 
local government officials. 
</P>
<P>
"We're going to work with Mr. Bennett," Barry said. "We're glad he's indicated 
this is a regional problem, not just a D.C. problem. 
</P>
<P>
Bennett on Monday announced an emergency $80-million federal plan to combat the 
city's escalating drug-related violence. 
</P>
<P>
Bennett's plan includes measures to expand prison space, establish a 
local-federal anti-drug task force and temporarily assign 10 military 
prosecutors to the local U.S. attorney's office. 
</P>
<P>
Barry said many of the open-air drug markets the city is targeting are near the 
city's borders with counties in Maryland. 
</P>
<P>
"We don't want to push the drug dealers and drug pushers across the line into 
these counties," he said.
