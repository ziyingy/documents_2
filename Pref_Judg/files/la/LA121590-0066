With spring arriving in the Southern Hemisphere, the Antarctic ozone hole is 
closing for the season, National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration 
scientists reported Friday. 
</P>
<P>
The hole is filling in late this year, said Samuel B. Oltmans of the agency's 
Climate Monitoring and Diagnostics Laboratory in Boulder, Colo. 
</P>
<P>
The delay was caused by a circle of persistent winds surrounding the Antarctic 
continent, which prevented air there from mixing with the atmosphere from other 
regions, officials said.

<P>
The agency reported that ozone levels over Antarctica climbed to 220 dobson 
units on Dec. 6 and to 270 units by Dec. 10, according to measurements made by 
instruments carried aloft by balloons. Ozone over the South Pole reached a low 
of 130 dobson units in early October, only marginally above the record low 
measured in 1987.

<P>
That thinning of the layer is sometimes referred to as a hole, although it 
amounts to somewhat less than half of the normal ozone level of over 300 units 
in that part of the world. 
</P>
<P>
Ozone is vital in the upper atmosphere, where it blocks some of the hazardous 
ultraviolet radiation from the sun. A reduction in ozone could lead to damage 
to crops and animal life and to an increase in skin cancer among humans, some 
scientists warn. 
</P>
<P>
The dobson unit is a measurement of ozone made by comparing how much of each of 
two wavelengths of sunlight is absorbed by the air. That ratio changes 
depending on the concentration of ozone.
