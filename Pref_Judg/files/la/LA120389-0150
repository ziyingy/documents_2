Blue-collar employees of Redondo Beach ratified a two-year contract with the 
city that provides annual wage increases of 6% but gave ground on a generous 
sick leave policy that union members had wanted for all members of the 
bargaining unit, City Manager Tim Casey said Saturday. 
</P>
<P>
The wage increases, which are retroactive to July 1, are in line with what the 
city offered its other bargaining units. 
</P>
<P>
Casey said that the union, which represents about 80 city employees, settled 
for a split policy on sick leave and disability pay that will treat employees 
hired after 1981 differently from those hired before. 
</P>
<P>
Employees with 10 years of service who were hired through the end of 1981 are 
entitled to accumulate up to two years of paid sick leave; those with 20 years 
of service can accumulate up to 2 1/2 years. Casey said the union wanted to 
keep this policy for all blue-collar city employees. 
</P>
<P>
But under the provisions of the contract, those hired in 1982 and later -- 
about half the bargaining unit -- will never be able to accumulate more than 12 
days of paid sick leave. Anything over that must be taken in cash in the year 
it was accumulated, he said. 
</P>
<P>
Nevertheless, those hired in 1982 and after will come under the citywide sick 
leave and disability policy that provides some benefits not offered by the 
policies covering those hired earlier. 
</P>
<P>
The more recently hired employees will get a bonus of $225 for perfect 
attendance. Each of these employees will be able to take up to a year of paid 
disability leave throughout their city career, the city official said. Casey 
said that the employees hired earlier will not get these rights. 
</P>
<P>
Unused disability leave for the employees hired in 1982 and later -- like 
unused sick leave accrued by the employees hired earlier -- can be cashed in at 
retirement, Casey said.

Patrick Chaplin, business agent for Teamsters Local 911, said the agreement was 
ratified Friday afternoon by an overwhelming majority, with only "a handful" 
voting against it. 
</P>
<P>
"The vote was not quite unanimous but very popular," he said. 
</P>
<P>
About three weeks ago, the union began picketing City Hall and sought 
assistance from a state mediator in reaching a contract. 
</P>
<P>
"As soon as we made that demand," Chaplin said, "the wheels began to roll in 
council and they decided to take a shot at settling it and they did."
