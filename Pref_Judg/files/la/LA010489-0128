The United States and Laos have agreed to a year-round effort of research and 
joint excavations to resolve the fate of nearly 550 Americans still officially 
listed as missing in action in Laos, the two governments announced today.

The plan represents the highest level of cooperation established between 
Washington and any of the communist nations of Indochina since war ended in the 
region in 1975. It also includes a pledge by Laos to cooperate with the United 
States in cracking down on opium produced in Laos and a U.S. promise to provide 
food to drought-stricken Laos.
