All 23 crew members aboard a leaking Liberian-flag freighter were plucked to 
safety Thursday after their vessel began sinking during rough weather, an 
official at Japan's Maritime Safety Agency said. An air force helicopter flew 
the 12 Filipino, four Chinese and five Hong Kong men and one Burmese to the 
western Japanese city of Kyoto from the 7,027-ton Maritime Gardenia.
