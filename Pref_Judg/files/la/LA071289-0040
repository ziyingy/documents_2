<P>
Senate-approved legislation to reduce the blood-alcohol level at which a 
motorist is considered drunk narrowly cleared a substantial barrier in the 
Assembly on Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
Assemblyman John Burton (D-San Francisco), chairman of the Public Safety 
Committee, who opposed such legislation in the past, cast the critical vote to 
send the proposal to the full Assembly. 
</P>
<P>
The author, Sen. Bill Leonard (R-Big Bear), predicted that the measure will win 
legislative approval and be sent to Gov. George Deukmejian, whose 
Administration supports it. 
</P>
<P>
The committee, long dominated by liberals and historically known to critics as 
the Assembly graveyard for law-and-order legislation, approved the bill on a 
5-0 vote, the exact favorable margin required on the eight-member panel. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Same Standard 
</P>
<P>
Since 1969 in California, a driver whose blood-alcohol level measures 0.10% has 
been presumed to be legally drunk. Leonard's bill would lower the level to 
0.08%, the same standard imposed by at least three other states. 
</P>
<P>
Leonard, who carried a similar bill several years ago that failed in the same 
committee, asserted Tuesday that his measure would send a strong signal that 
"if you are going to drink, make other plans about driving." 
</P>
<P>
He said that while a driver now is presumed to be legally drunk at 0.10%, a 
motorist's judgment and driving skills are impaired at 0.08%, a contention 
disputed by some opponents of the bill. 
</P>
<P>
"I want everyone to know that they are impaired, even at very low blood alcohol 
levels," Leonard said. 
</P>
<P>
But Burton and Assemblyman Charles W. Quackenbush (R-Saratoga), who also voted 
for the bill, asked how a drinking person could determine when he or she had 
reached 0.08% or even 0.10%. 
</P>
<P>
Leonard conceded that there is no universal standard that fits everyone but 
that a 0.08% level would make "people more aware before they begin to drink and 
(motivate) them in advance to have someone else drive." 
</P>
<P>
Representatives of opponents of the bill, the California Public Defenders Assn. 
and California Attorneys for Criminal Justice, argued that existing law is 
adequate. 
</P>
<P>
Among other things, they noted that it is possible for a prosecutor to get a 
drunk driving conviction at 0.08% or less and that studies of the issue 
produced conflicting results over how impaired the judgment was of various 
drivers who tested at 0.08%. 
</P>
<P>
After the committee action, Leonard cited Burton for heading a "real turnaround 
on that committee for my bill." 
</P>
<P>
As a relatively new assemblyman in 1966, Burton voted against the "implied 
consent" law, under which a driver's license can be suspended or revoked for 
failure to submit to a blood alcohol test. Three years later, he voted against 
the bill that set the 0.10% level for intoxication. 
</P>
<P>
In 1974, Burton was elected to Congress but did not seek reelection in 1982 
because of a problem with alcohol and drugs. He since has fought his way back 
to sobriety and was returned to the Assembly last year. 
</P>
<P>
"I think that driving under the influence is a very serious situation," Burton 
said in response to a reporter's question about his reversal on voting for a 
drunk driving bill that closely resembled one he voted against in 1969. 
</P>
<P>
He indicated that attitudes about drunk driving, including his own views, have 
changed drastically over the years. 
</P>
<P>
"There was a time when guys almost bragged about the fact that they had five or 
six (drunk driving arrests)," he said. "People used to joke about it." 
</P>
<P>
Asked whether his own experience with substance abuse played a part in his vote 
on the Leonard bill, Burton replied without elaboration, "Maybe."
