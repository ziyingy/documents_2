The Grateful Dead's Jerry Garcia says just say yes to legalizing drugs. "It's 
the obvious solution," he says in a Rolling Stone interview. "Greed and the 
desire to take drugs are two separate things. If you want to separate the two, 
the thing you do is make drugs legal. Accept the reality that people do want to 
change their consciousness and make an effort to make safer, healthier drugs." 
Later in the same interview, Garcia says he is glad he has beaten his own drug 
problem. "I'm glad I'm not involved in it any more," he says. "I really am. But 
I haven't come to any conclusions about drugs at all on any level. I don't 
think I've gained any particular insights."
