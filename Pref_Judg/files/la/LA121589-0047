As a practicing veterinarian and president of the Southern California 
Veterinary Medical Assn. (SCVMA), which represents more than 1,000 
veterinarians in the greater Los Angeles area, I would like to take issue with 
the article "What Price a Pal?" 
</P>
<P>
I am appreciative that The Times is willing to devote space to the profession 
of veterinary medicine. However, it is my belief that the article in question 
painted a "not true" impression of veterinary costs and practitioner attitudes.

There is no question that, with the advancement in veterinary care today, 
almost any procedure that is available to humans is also available to animals. 
When these new elective procedures are sought by the pet-owning public, 
substantial costs can be generated. However, similar procedures in human 
medicine cost tenfold more than the same procedures in veterinary medicine. 
</P>

In reality, the average veterinary bill is far below the figures quoted in the 
article, and alternative funding options are readily available for those 
services that are expensive. Pet insurance is easily available for a moderate 
fee for both accidental and major medical eventualities. In addition, many 
veterinarians are willing to work out payment plans, while others simply absorb 
expenses or reduce fees to assist deserving clients and their animal patients.
