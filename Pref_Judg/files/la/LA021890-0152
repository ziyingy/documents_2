It was homecoming at The Master's College on Saturday night and the top door 
prize was a shot at a berth in the NAIA District 3 playoffs. 
</P>
<P>
A noisy, overflow crowd, estimated at 300 more than the gym's 1,000-person 
capacity, saw the Mustangs virtually clinch their first playoff berth with an 
84-64 win over defending district champion Biola. 
</P>
<P>
And afterward, Master's Coach Mel Hankinson was praising the fans as much as 
the players. 
</P>
<P>
"I thought they played a big part," Hankinson said of the crowd that began to 
fill the gym an hour and a half before game time. "This was a big win. We're 
99% sure of receiving the first bid in this school's history, and I like those 
percentages." 
</P>
<P>
Before this season, Master's (18-14, 10-6 in district play) had not beaten 
Biola since 1971 and had won only three of 43 games against the Eagles. But the 
Mustangs have won all three meetings this season. 
</P>
<P>
"I think this team is peaking at the right time," Hankinson said. "We're really 
playing well." 
</P>
<P>
Somewhat hesitant in the early going, Master's fell behind, 5-0, but quickly 
recovered and built a 38-28 halftime lead. 
</P>
<P>
Master's scored the first three baskets of the second half to build the lead to 
16, but Biola (9-19, 6-8) put together an eight-point run to cut the margin to 
61-56 with seven minutes remaining. 
</P>
<P>
Jason Webster then hit a 17-foot jump shot, and reserve Stuart Epperson made 
six consecutive points to put Master's in front, 69-56. 
</P>
<P>
"I thought Stuart Epperson was one of the unsung heroes," Hankinson said. "He 
turned the momentum back to us." 
</P>
<P>
Epperson's outburst put the Eagles on the ropes, but the final blow came when 
Biola center Jeff Baker, who scored a game-high 23 points, suffered a nasty 
gash above the eye and left the game with 4:21 to play. 
</P>
<P>
Master's quickly pulled away and padded the final margin with dunks by Webster 
and Tom Bruner. 
</P>
<P>
Webster led Master's with 21 points and nine rebounds, Epperson and Bruner each 
scored 14 points and Damon Greer scored 10 points and had eight assists. 
</P>
<P>
Jimmy Hill (18 points) was the only other Biola scorer to reach double figures.
