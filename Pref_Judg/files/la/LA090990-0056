Those Buckleys. How cheeky can a family get? 
</P>
<P>
All right, I admit it from the start: I've spent half a lifetime shielding 
myself from the Yahoo world view of Citizen William F. and the logorrhea he 
schleps with him. But I admit this, too: The guy's charm, wit, and overworked 
erudition can be thoroughly engaging. So what if his lips hardly move, his spy 
thrillers do. Now there's his second son's drug-themed second novel to contend 
with. 
</P>
<P>
So, caveat emptor and Liberals of the world, unite, because John Buckley has 
most assuredly been dunked in the same socio-political gene pool as his old 
man, but with a few serious adjustments we can be thankful for. First, Buckley 
fils writes a helluva lot better than Buckley pere. Second, the kid is much 
funnier and a good deal less self-righteous. But, more importantly, there's the 
younger Buckley's take on things, darkly comic and a shade askew. He's no mere 
ideologue. He understands that life overflows with moral ambiguities: "You 
didn't have to live in a city as wracked by crack as the District of Columbia," 
writes Buckley, ". . . to realize how things had changed from the days . . . 
when smuggling drugs into the country was a high calling, no pun intended, 
since it was a game no more serious in the larger questions it raised than 
moonshiners versus 'revenuers.' " 
</P>
<P>
Still, conservatives need not worry. His bloodline and partyline lean far 
enough to the right as to almost topple over. But while he served as a deputy 
press secretary to the '84 Reagan-Bush campaign before heading off to run the 
press staff for the Republican Congressional Committee, he's also toiled as a 
rock critic, a line item that begs a veto from most right-wing resumes. If John 
Buckley hasn't completely embraced what passes for culture in this the twilight 
of the 20th Century -- you know, sex, drugs and rock 'n' roll -- he at least 
acknowledges its presence. Reading him, you get the picture he might have 
indulged a little himself. 
</P>
<P>
In short, he's a Buckley all right -- at times extreme right -- but with 
pretensions towards hipness. Things could be worse, no? 
</P>
<P>
Well, maybe not. Because what John Buckley has pulled off in "Statute of 
Limitations" is really a kind of cosmic joke. He's elected a sort of decent if 
weak-willed Democrat (for a Buckley, is there any other kind?) to the White 
House (a Democrat in the White House?), given him a speech writer with a very 
good heart and very bad judgment, and then embroiled the latter in a 
drug-running plot that's hinged on his drug-using past. 
</P>
<P>
What salvages "Statute of Limitations" is the question it raises about a 
generation's past drug use. "Statute of Limitations" is, of course, the phrase 
given for the time limit within which a crime can be prosecuted. Murder has 
none. Drugs do. But given America's vehement anti-drug temperament these days, 
just how long must the Baby Boomers be held accountable for their 
experimentation with recreational pharmaceuticals in the Good Old Days? 
</P>
<P>
The question's an important one, and will continue to be raised in the coming 
years. We've already seen one Supreme Court nominee shot down in part over his 
admission to smoking pot, and, in a Massachusetts election last year, several 
of the state's politicos -- from Sen. John Kerry, a decorated Viet Nam vet, 
down -- came clean with the fact that they'd blown some weed back when hair, 
and tolerance, both seemed a little longer. 
</P>
<P>
So, just when will the statute of limitations lapse on an activity that, 
illegal as it may have been, became a de facto part of life for a significant 
segment of the country's population now stepping into real roles of power and 
leadership? 
</P>
<P>
Until then, we are all potential prisoners to our pasts, law-abiding citizens 
forced to sneak around the back alleys of our lives for fear that someone, 
somewhere, might point a finger and say, "Remember when?" It is a scenario for 
emotional blackmail. 
</P>
<P>
Which is precisely the predicament Thomas O'Malley, subscriber to the old 
prep-school creed of "Admit nothing, deny everything" and speechwriter to the 
newlyelected Democratic president of the United States, finds himself in when 
his old Amherst roommate, David Nicole, former campus dealer extraordinaire, 
reappears with a scheme that almost results in the collapse of the presidency. 
O'Malley doesn't bring down the President, but, in the end, he does bring down 
the novel. 
</P>
<P>
He has to be one of the stupidest protagonists (and he's the first to admit how 
dumb he is) ever to wander between covers, petty in his fears, selfish in his 
ends, and constructed with the moral consistency of Jell-O (which is probably 
why a Buckley made him a Democrat). Moral ambiguity is one thing; the ability 
to make a decision in the face of danger to control your life is something 
else. Once events take control of him -- and they do -- it's not O'Malley's 
character but rather his luck, and the ability of a dogged, if thoroughly 
soused, suspended FBI agent in the right place at the right time that 
ultimately saves him. 
</P>
<P>
What saves "Statute of Limitations" is Buckley's own delicious wickedness. His 
portraits of White House back-stabbing, an over-preening press, and the marital 
woes of O'Malley's parents -- his father's an alcoholic former CIA operative; 
his mother's a bleeding-heart -- are finely detailed, drawn with wit and 
precision. So is the way Buckley counterpoints the ravages of alcohol abuse 
with the dangers of drugs. 
</P>
<P>
But what's most worthy here is that Buckley locked onto a question that needs 
to be grappled with by a society whose forgiveness tends to be selective. It's 
what keeps "Statute of Limitations" from ultimately going up in smoke.
