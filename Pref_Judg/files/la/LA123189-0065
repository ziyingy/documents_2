Just when pop music seemed to be growing flabby and totally predictable, rock's 
wacky assortment of brawling Young Turks and eccentric '60s survivors combined 
to provide fans with another year of outrageous events and nutty behavior. 
</P>
<P>
Who's to say who pulled off the strangest stunt: 
</P>
<P>
Was it KLOS-FM's Mark &amp; Brian, who celebrated Elvis' birthday by flying to 
Memphis, where the deejays did their morning show from Graceland? (They were 
thrown out when a security guard became suspicious and spotted a hidden 
transmitter in their umbrellas.) 
</P>
<P>
Was it the pop duo Was (Not Was), which according to Hits magazine hired 
doubles to play them at a concert gig in Minneapolis while they were in Toronto 
finishing a film score? 
</P>
<P>
Or was it Guns N' Roses guitarist Izzy Stradlin, who was arrested this fall for 
urinating in the galley of an airplane on a flight from Indianapolis to Phoenix 
after he found all the restrooms occupied? 
</P>
<P>
Perhaps the oddest couples of all were rock stars and their corporate sponsors. 
After saying in March that it stood "completely" behind its $5-million Madonna 
ad extravaganza, Pepsi-Cola announced on April 4 that it had dropped plans to 
run any more Madonna ads, following complaints and boycott threats by religious 
groups. Meanwhile, the Who's Pete Townshend, a self-confessed recovering 
alcoholic, played a summer tour sponsored by Miller and Budweiser breweries. 
</P>
<P>
On the other hand, Tom Waits sued Frito-Lay, claiming the firm used a Waits 
sound-alike in a Doritos radio ad campaign. Bette Midler won $400,000 in 
damages from the ad agency that used an ex-Midler back-up singer to mimic her 
voice in a Mercury Sable commercial. And most wondrous of all: MTV, which had 
refused to air Neil Young's "This Note's for You" video, claiming it contained 
too many product plugs, proceeded to give the banned video its Video of the 
Year award this fall. 
</P>
<P>
Any way you look at it, 1989 was a banner year for pop follies. To celebrate 
the music world's clown princes, our yearly roundup of dubious achievements, 
inglorious moments and show-biz misadventures: 
</P>
<P>
SLIM JIMS OF THE YEAR: According to the Washington Post, several flabby members 
of Bon Jovi, namely bassist Alec Such and drummer Tico Torres, underwent 
painful liposuction treatment after image-conscious bandleader Jon Bon Jovi 
reportedly told his group-mates to either shape up or ship out. 
</P>
<P>
PROMOTION OF THE YEAR: The 2 Live Crew, a Florida-based rap group known for 
their sexually explicit lyrics, signed an endorsement deal to tout Homeboy 
condoms for the Boston-based Custom Condom firm, which in return included 
Homeboy condoms in the group's albums and tapes. 
</P>
<P>
ROCK MANAGER OF THE YEAR: San Francisco Giants manager Roger Craig received a 
host of congratulatory telegrams after his team's playoff victory, including 
one from the Grateful Dead: "I didn't know anything about them," Craig said. "I 
thought they were a funeral home." 
</P>
<P>
NUPTIALS OF THE YEAR: When pop performer Mojo Nixon married his longtime 
girlfriend this summer, the couple tied the knot at a San Diego go-cart track. 
They exchanged vows through bullhorns and took the traditional "wedding lap" in 
go-carts after being showered by balloons reading "I Married a Big Foot." 
</P>
<P>
LAWSUIT OF THE YEAR: Ex-Beatle Ringo Starr won a permanent injunction last 
month from a federal judge blocking the release of a 1987 solo album, claiming 
he and other musicians recorded it while drunk. (Starr recently underwent detox 
treatment for alcoholism.) 
</P>
<P>
GOLDEN GLOVES OF THE YEAR: To Motley Crue's Vince Neil, who punched Guns N' 
Roses' Izzy Stradlin backstage at the MTV Awards this fall, prompting Izzy to 
respond: "Fortunately Vince is a powder puff and can't do much damage." 
</P>
<P>
SEANCE OF THE YEAR: The seventh L.A. Guitar Show featured a first-ever Rock 
Seance, with the intention of contacting such dead pop legends as Elvis, Duane 
Allman, John Lennon and Buddy Holly. No tables shook, though two spectators 
claimed they felt Bob Marley and Jimi Hendrix speaking through them. 
</P>
<P>
IKE TURNER ARREST OF THE YEAR: Ike Turner, whose long string of drug busts 
began in 1970, was arrested again last May by West Hollywood police for 
possession of rock cocaine. The bust came shortly after Turner appeared on 
Arsenio Hall's TV show, claiming most of his arrests had been caused by police 
mistaking baking soda for cocaine. (Hall responded: "Ike, what are you doing 
snorting baking soda?") 
</P>
<P>
MICHAEL JACKSON DISGUISE OF THE YEAR: To the Gloved One himself, who was asked 
to leave a jewelry store in Simi Valley last spring when employees became 
suspicious of a customer wearing a wig with a phony mustache and false teeth. 
When a security guard took him outside the store, the pop star peeled off his 
mustache and said: "I'm in disguise. I'm Michael Jackson." 
</P>
<P>
FASHION TREND OF THE YEAR: Japanese teens have become such huge rap fans that 
they don't just wear Fila warm-up suits and Air Jordan sneakers. A Los Angeles 
Herald-Examiner fashion story last summer reported that they go to rap clubs 
with the ultimate fashion statement -- they paint their faces black. 
</P>
<P>
VISIONARY OF THE YEAR: Asked about his video channel's programming strategy, 
then-MTV chief Lee Masters told GQ magazine: "We think 'stupid' is a great part 
of what we do, and I say that in a very positive sense. I think stupid is 
wonderful today. . . . If you're a 17-year-old, you still like cars, you still 
like girls and you still like rock 'n' roll -- even if you're a Young 
Republican kid. And I think stupid is part of that. It's a universal." 
</P>
<P>
PROMOTION OF THE YEAR: The always-irreverent Rhino Records organized a "Day of 
the Dead" promotion in October where the store offered a $1 discount on any 
album made by a band with a deceased musician, complete with the ad slogan: "No 
record's a stiff at Rhino." 
</P>
<P>
HUMBLE ROCK STAR OF THE YEAR: When Jon Bon Jovi was slapped with a trespassing 
summons after sneaking onto the Wollman ice-skating rink in Central Park with 
his girlfriend last summer, Rolling Stone reported he repeatedly complained to 
security guards: "I know I'm trespassing. I'm Bon Jovi. Do you know me? Do you 
have kids? They know me." 
</P>
<P>
FRIENDLY RIVAL OF THE YEAR: Badmouthing CBS chief exec Larry Tisch's move to 
sell CBS Records to Sony for a measly $2 billion in 1988, Geffen Records 
chairman David Geffen told The Times earlier this year: "I just wish Larry 
Tisch would sell me something." 
</P>
<P>
ALBUM TITLE OF THE YEAR: Playfully hyping a new compilation of cuts from bands 
signed to its label, Restless Records called the anthology: "Only 39,999,999 
Behind 'Thriller.' " 
</P>
<P>
CHAUVINIST OF THE YEAR: Slick Rick, who explained in Spin magazine the attitude 
behind his new song, "Treat Her Like a Prostitute," by saying: "Say there's a 
girl that you like a lot, but you don't know nothing about her. The best way to 
see if she's a nice girl or a tramp is to treat her like a tramp first. If you 
treat her good first, you'll never know." 
</P>
