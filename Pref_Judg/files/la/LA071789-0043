Scientists have detected new evidence that ozone concentrations decline 
periodically over the Arctic, as in the annual depletion that forms the "ozone 
hole" over Antarctica. The researchers found a high-altitude ozone deficit that 
resembles an early step in formation of the Antarctic ozone hole, said study 
co-author D. J. Hofmann.

Previous research has also suggested ozone depletions over the Arctic.

The Antarctic hole is an area in which up to 50% of atmospheric ozone 
disappears for a limited time. In the Arctic, perhaps 25% could disappear under 
highly unusual, worst-case circumstances, Hofmann said.

The new study is reported in the British journal Nature by Hofmann, who is a 
physics professor at the University of Wyoming, and scientists from France, 
Japan, New Zealand and the University of Houston.
