<P>
The Pico Rivera City Council has approved an ordinance under which alcohol can 
be sold at service stations if the business obtains a special city permit. 
</P>
<P>
In 1986, the council banned alcohol sales at all service stations. But last 
year, the Legislature passed a law making such blanket bans illegal, so the 
City Council complied with the state's action through the ordinance allowing 
alcohol sales only with a city permit.

<P>
Even under the city permit, issued with the approval of the Planning 
Commission, alcohol sales would be restricted. Alcohol display and sale areas 
would be limited, the percentage of alcohol sales could not exceed the sales of 
non-alcohol products and the hours of alcohol sales would be limited.
