If you're looking for a terrific mementos of turn-of-the-century antiques, head 
for this friendly industrial city about 75 miles northwest of Chicago. 
</P>
<P>
Rockford's population of roughly 148,000 supports two sizable antiques malls 
with nearly 200 dealers, two Saturday and Sunday antiques flea markets with 
dozens of dealers and more than a dozen individual antique shops.

They sell all sorts of American antiques, including furniture, farm equipment, 
kitchen utensils, gadgets, books, prints, toys, clothing and personal 
accessories.

Quality and condition of goods vary greatly from shop to shop, but prices are 
reasonable. That's because local dealers have purchased items directly from the 
attics and basements of families whose ancestors settled the town.

<P>
This concentration of antiques outlets is only one aspect of Rockford's romance 
with the past. Before touring the shops, take time to absorb the city's
