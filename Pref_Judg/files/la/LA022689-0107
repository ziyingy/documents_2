Investigators trying to discover what ripped a truck-sized hole in the side of 
a United Airlines Boeing 747 near Hawaii said late Saturday they could find no 
evidence of a bomb. They reported that the accident, which killed nine 
passengers, could have been caused by a cargo door which gave way because of 
air pressure inside the plane. 
</P>
<P>
Michael Marx, senior metallurgist for the National Transportation Safety Board, 
said, however, that there was no indication of any extraordinary pressure or 
weight load on the cargo door. 
</P>
<P>
When asked why the door gave way, Marx replied: "Did you ever bust a balloon" 
by blowing it up over and over again? 
</P>
<P>
He declined to be more specific. 
</P>
<P>
Marx said there were no signs of metal fatigue or corrosion on cargo door locks 
that were still on the plane. But he would say nothing about whether there was 
an indication that any latches failed. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Pacific Crisscrossed 
</P>
<P>
As investigators pored over the aircraft, searchers crisscrossed the Pacific 
Ocean looking for survivors. "You know, a normal human being just can't last 
that long, even in 70-degree waters -- plus they fell 22,000 feet," Coast Guard 
spokesman Keith Spanger said. If anyone lived through the fall, Spangler said, 
chances for survival were slim. 
</P>
<P>
He said the sea was infested with sharks. 
</P>
<P>
At least one of the victims was sucked into the whirling blades of a jet 
engine. The blades were bent, and a medical examiner found "multiple small body 
parts" inside. 
</P>
<P>
More than 30 investigators, headed by Lee Dickinson, a member of the NTSB, 
swarmed through the plane trying to discover why a cargo door and part of the 
fuselage came apart early Friday as the aircraft climbed up and away from 
Honolulu International Airport and turned toward Aukland, New Zealand, carrying 
357 people. 
</P>
<P>
A hundred miles south of Hawaii, the door and a section of metal above it tore 
out of the fuselage and the jumbo jet decompressed. In addition to the 
passengers who were sucked out, 27 others, including several crew members, were 
hurt by flying debris. Two engines failed, and pilot David Cronin returned and 
landed the jet like a lead sled -- hard but safely. 
</P>
<P>
It was the third in a recent series of structural failures on Boeing planes. 
Last April, the top of a 737 peeled off during an Aloha Airlines flight from 
Hilo to Honolulu, killing an attendant and hurting 61 others. In December, an 
Eastern Airlines 727 was forced down in West Virginia after a 14-inch hole 
opened its fuselage. Nobody was hurt. 
</P>
<P>
Dickinson said his team would investigate every possibility to determine the 
cause of the latest accident. "All doors are completely wide open," he added. 
</P>
<P>
But he said his experts would pay particular attention to the cargo door and 
its locking mechanisms -- and the aircraft cargo area. By nightfall Saturday, 
the Coast Guard had not recovered the door, and Dickinson said the chances of 
finding it diminish with each passing hour. He said the door was one thing 
investigators would especially like to see. 
</P>
<P>
Last year, the Federal Aviation Administration called the attention of airlines 
operating 747s to an instance in which a cargo door opened partially in flight. 
It said this could "result in rapid decompression of the airplane." The FAA 
ordered the airlines to reinforce cargo door locks with steel plates. 
</P>
<P>
The agency gave the airlines until next Dec. 31 to complete the modification. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Modification Not Made 
</P>
<P>
When asked whether locks had been reinforced on the United jet, Russell Mack, 
the airline's vice president of corporate communications, said the modification 
had been made on six of the 25 United 747s in the same model series. But Mack 
added: "This plane had not been done." 
</P>
<P>
Reporters were taken to within 100 feet of the plane. It was clear that its 
cargo door, hinged at the top, had lifted cleanly from the bottom of its 
aperture and had been torn off the airplane -- hinge and all -- taking part of 
the fuselage with it and ripping a jagged edge along the upper part of the hole 
it left behind. 
</P>
<P>
Strips of metal aircraft skin had been peeled away and were hanging from the 
top of the hole. 
</P>
<P>
Through the hole, the passenger floor was clearly visible. Some seats were 
still attached. 
</P>
<P>
The cabin ceiling had fallen and parts that were not sucked out still filled 
the aisles with debris. 
</P>
<P>
Other members of Dickinson's team will talk to flight crew members, including 
Cronin, a 34-year veteran pilot whom United hailed as a hero for bringing the 
severely damaged jet and its 348 remaining occupants down safely. 
</P>
<P>
Despite its damage and the lack of power from two of its four engines, Cronin 
landed the aircraft with nothing more than a hard jolt -- and some ruptured 
tires. 
</P>
<P>
The first officer was G. A. (Al) Slater. R. M. (Mark) Thomas was the second 
officer. All three men are based in the Los Angeles area. 
</P>
<P>
The flight had 15 attendants, credited by passengers with maintaining calm on 
the plane. The attendants are based in Honolulu. 
</P>
<P>
Some investigators have been assigned to document survival factors: the type, 
severity and cause of the injuries suffered; how the cabin flew apart, and 
rescue efforts on the ground. Still others will study the plane's maintenance 
records. Others will check its engines. And another group will review the 
contents of its cockpit voice and flight data recorders. 
</P>
<P>
Dickinson said neither he nor any members of his team will try to offer any 
explanation shedding light on the accident for several weeks. "We will not be 
making any causal determinations while we are here on scene . . . " he said. 
"But (eventually) we will figure out what happened and why." 
</P>
<P>
Other aviation experts also were focusing attention on the cargo door, its 
locks and surrounding structure. Although representatives of Pratt &amp; 
Whitney, which made the engines on the jet, are aiding the investigation, 
experts say its two engine failures are probably the result of foreign-object 
ingestion from the fuselage blowout. 
</P>
<P>
It is unlikely, these experts said, that the engine failures caused the 
accident. 
</P>
<P>
The FBI also was assisting in the investigation. 
</P>
<P>
Special Agent Harlan Frymire said the bureau was looking into "several calls 
claiming responsibility" for the disaster. 
</P>
<P>
But he said such calls are typical after a spectacular incident. 
</P>
<P>
None of the calls "dovetailed" with other information authorities had, Frymire 
said. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Interviews Completed 
</P>
<P>
He said agents had finished interviewing all passengers, crew members and other 
airline employes with access to the plane -- such as baggage handlers -- and 
had found "no irregularities." 
</P>
<P>
No one who was supposed to have boarded Flight 811 in Honolulu failed to do so 
and hence might be responsible for bombing the plane, he said. 
</P>
<P>
However, he added: "We still consider the cause to be undetermined." 
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the Navy and Coast Guard almost doubled their search area to cover 
3,000 square miles of the Pacific. 
</P>
<P>
A Coast Guard cutter recovered "what appeared to be part of the fuselage" 
Friday night, spokesman Spangler said. The 4-by-6-foot piece of metal was 
turned over to investigators, along with several smaller pieces of debris. A 
Navy helicopter reported spotting what appeared to be a luggage rack Saturday 
morning. 
</P>
<P>
Spangler said most of the debris was spotted in water 88 miles south-southwest 
of Honolulu Harbor. 
</P>
<P>
"Anything that's floating, we're picking up," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Searchers speculated that large pieces of debris probably sank in the 
15,000-foot-deep ocean. 
</P>
<P>
Spangler said three helicopters, two planes and four vessels would continue 
combing the sea until nightfall, then decide whether to resume at daybreak. 
</P>
<P>
Hospitals in Honolulu reported treating 27 people, mostly for minor injuries. 
Five remained hospitalized Saturday. 
</P>
<P>
After leaving the plane, 200 passengers boarded other flights. Those who did 
not want to continue were put up in hotels. 
</P>
<P>
United towed the damaged 747 to Hickam Air Force Base, adjacent to Honolulu 
International Airport, and concealed it from public view. 
</P>
<P>
The jumbo jet is 18 years and three months old. After 20 years of service, 
Boeing says, its jets need increased inspections and repairs because they crack 
more frequently. 
</P>
<P>
Here, compiled by the Associated Press, are recent incidents involving airliner 
aging and metal fatigue: 
</P>
<P>
 -- Jan. 20, 1989. A Piedmont Airlines 737 dropped an engine shortly after 
takeoff from Chicago. None of three passengers and crew were injured and the 
plane landed safely. The aircraft was seven years old, but authorities blamed 
metal fatigue and a cracked bolt. 
</P>
<P>
 -- Sept. 21, 1988. An American Airlines 727 made a belly landing at Dallas-Ft. 
Worth after metal fatigue in its landing gear prevented the pilot from opening 
the wheel well door. The 88 passengers and crew evacuated with three people 
injured. Boeing had recommended inspections eight days earlier after finding 
metal fatigue in the same area in other 727s. 
</P>
<P>
 -- May 9, 1988. A 20-year-old American Airlines 727 was forced to make an 
unscheduled landing at Detroit after a 15-inch crack in a wheel well caused a 
drop in cabin pressure.
