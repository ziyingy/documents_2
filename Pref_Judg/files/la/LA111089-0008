The tall, chain-smoking Matsuda, who played Douglas' adversary in the picture 
about a macho cop from New York City who is trying to bring back an extradited 
murderer from Japan, was virtually unknown outside Japan until the release of 
the detective thriller, which was set and photographed in the western Japanese 
city of Osaka.
