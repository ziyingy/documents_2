The AIDS crisis is almost a decade old and the toll within the arts community 
has been catastrophic, but only now has a major national arts service 
organization addressed the widespread fear and confusion that AIDS inspires. 
</P>
<P>
"AIDS in the Dance/Arts Work Place," a 32-page special issue of the trade 
journal Update, produced by Dance/USA, offers a no-nonsense approach to 
Acquired Immune Deficiency Syndrome and the disease's traumatic impact on the 
world of dance. 
</P>
<P>
Its point? To train dance management to look at AIDS as if it were any other 
catastrophic illness afflicting dancers, who are feeling more vulnerable and 
stigmatized than ever before. 
</P>
<P>
"A publication like Update could help make all of us deal with AIDS not just 
more compassionately, but also more justly," says David White, executive 
director of New York's Dance Theater Workshop and emcee of the recent Bessie 
Awards (which thoroughly addressed the crisis of AIDS and dance). 
</P>
<P>
"AIDS, particularly on the national level, had always been a taboo subject in 
the dance world. . . . With Update, that's changing." 
</P>
<P>
Normally, the 2,000-circulation, Washington-based Update journal deals with 
such subjects as dance funding, government support and taxation issues, career 
moves and new technologies. But Update editor Garth Tate had heard stories 
about dancers and AIDS as early as 1983 and hoped, he says, "to take a 
leadership role with Update . . . (and) be pro-active policy makers in this 
crisis." 
</P>
<P>
Last November, his hopes were realized. With funding from the National 
Endowment for the Arts' Dance Program, the National Assembly of State Arts 
Agencies, and the members of Dance/USA, Tate compiled and edited what he called 
"the most gratifying experience in my career as a writer" -- a booklet that 
deals with the "ABCs" of AIDS as if the epidemic had just entered the national 
consciousness. 
</P>
<P>
The issue opens with a thorough, if at times emphatically basic, discussion of 
what AIDS is and how it's prevented. There are statistics, charts and diagrams 
about the states and cities hit hardest by AIDS. (New York has the most AIDS 
cases with 17,997; California is at a close second with 15,185). There is also 
a bare bones list of basic treatments, but "alternative therapies" are left to 
physicians and community-based underground "buyer's clubs." 
</P>
<P>
It includes mainstream addresses of AIDS service organizations nationwide, but 
is grossly incomplete when it comes to leading individuals to the 
community-based organizations that can best serve them. 
</P>
<P>
(For example, the organizations that are overlooked in L.A. include Minority 
AIDS Project, the AIDS Coalition to Unleash Power (ACT UP), the Women's AIDS 
Project and Being Alive: a Person with AIDS Action Coalition). 
</P>
<P>
Most strikingly, the publication seeks to puncture the AIDS paranoia still 
ballooning outside major cities by dealing with questions about possible modes 
of transmission among dancers. For instance, Update says that sweat does not 
transfer HIV, (or Human Immunodeficiency Virus, which most scientists believe 
causes AIDS), and dancers should not feel at risk if they share costumes. 
However, the sharing of dance shoes should be monitored: 
</P>
<P>
"Sometimes dancers' feet bleed, and one could conceive that if a dancer were to 
borrow another's shoes that were still bloody, and she has open sores on her 
own feet as well, that transmission could be possible." All the same, the 
publication suggests that it is unlikely that AIDS could be transmitted through 
shoe exchange. 
</P>
<P>
Essentially, however, Update's focus is on ethics: philosophical guidelines to 
coping with AIDS in the workplace. "There is no relevant difference between the 
way employers should treat employees with, say, lung cancer or kidney disease 
and the way they should treat people with AIDS or HIV infection," it insists. 
</P>
<P>
The heart of the publication is the 10-page transcript of a Dance/USA 1988 
National Round Table in January 1988 called "Addressing AIDS in the Workplace," 
chaired by Gary Dunning, executive director of the Houston Ballet. 
</P>
<P>
Dunning counsels against "permitting prejudice to be masked as sound economic 
policy." Most important, he argues vehemently against "dealing with AIDS on a 
case-by-case basis." He says "the lack of a consistent and iron-clad policy 
could leave a company open to potential legal action and charges of 
unfairness." 
</P>
<P>
Anyone who harasses a co-worker about being HIV-positive should be reprimanded 
or eventually dismissed, says the booklet, and a company manager should not 
make the mistake of asking an HIV-infected dancer how she or he feels so often 
as to be oppressive or fatalistic. As Tate recognizes, "there is a clear 
distinction between AIDS and HIV." 
</P>
<P>
Update consistently counsels that, "the relevant standard is job performance, 
which should be applied fairly and consistently." 
</P>
<P>
Given the praise from management in the dance world, Tate hasn't received 
nearly as much feedback from individual dancers. He's worried that the "artists 
may have no idea what their rights are." 
</P>
<P>
His fears are well-founded. The weakness of the booklet is that it addresses 
AIDS as if it were an occupational hazard, avoiding the personal touch that the 
publi-cation itself calls for. 
</P>
<P>
Update's greatest faux pas is that in all of its 32 pages, the only person who 
speaks openly about having AIDS is "a well-known Hollywood hairdresser." 
</P>
<P>
While the hairdresser's advice is well taken ("Don't monitor my health: The 
most annoying thing is when people continually ask you how you are with that 
very concerned tone in their voice"), it's undercut by the fact that he does 
not speak as a representative of dancers or their managers. 
</P>
<P>
Still, Tate's the first to admit that the publication isn't "complete" and "the 
last word on the subject." He is aware that it's geared less to individual 
artists than it is to companies. "But we have to begin somewhere." 
</P>
<P>
In the dance world, the tendency is to applaud any gesture that attempts to 
confront the magnitude of AIDS -- no matter how "safe" and non-controversial it 
is. In fact, the Update booklet on AIDS shows how far the dance community has 
yet to go and how much AIDS denial clouds any truly aggressive leadership. 
</P>
<P>
If, as Tate argues, there was such a pressing need for direction during this 
epidemic, why wait until 1988 to publish an AIDS guide? 
</P>
<P>
"It would be dishonest to suggest that there was no denial on the part of the 
dance community in dealing with AIDS," Tate answers. "For years we heard horror 
stories -- especially as regards insurance companies refusing to represent 
dance companies. It took even longer for dancers to talk about AIDS." 
</P>
<P>
Tate argues that a "lack of leadership on the national level" caused AIDS to be 
immediately stigmatized as a gay disease. "Not only did this make it difficult 
to be gay in the mid-'80s," he adds, "it also made it very difficult to be a 
male dancer. 
</P>
<P>
"I have no doubt that in many ways this publication may be somewhat dated -- 
AIDS treatment and legislation change everyday -- but there may be a dancer in 
Kansas somewhere who wants to take an AIDS test but is frightened about the 
consequences. This booklet can help him or her. It can help dancers inform 
their company mangers about what they should be doing to prepare for the AIDS 
hurricane about to hit." Although as many people have died from AIDS in the 
last nine years as died in the Vietnam War, Tate says "We haven't even seen the 
tip of the AIDS iceberg in this country." "Millions of people are infected 
because our President did not go all out and call for AIDS education. Every 
corporation, every work place, will have to address the very same issues we're 
addressing: How to be fair, consistent and compassionate. How do deal with 
finances and hysteria? How to be aggressive leaders? "My message to the dancers 
and company managers out there is to take the initiative and educate yourself."
