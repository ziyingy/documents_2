Trustees of the Los Angeles County Museum of Art said they decided not to renew 
industrialist Armand Hammer's term on their board because he changed his mind 
about donating his art collection to the museum and was focusing on plans for 
his own museum. 
</P>
<P>
Hammer has served on the county museum board for the last 20 years. But 
trustees agreed last week to allow his current term to expire June 30. 
</P>
<P>
"He's not coming to meetings," board President Daniel N. Belin said. "He has 
abandoned his commitment to make the gift of his collection." 
</P>
<P>
"Obviously his energies at this point are directed to his own museum," said 
Richard E. Sherwood, a member of the board's executive committee and chairman 
of the nominating committee. 
</P>
<P>
Sherwood was referring to a private facility Hammer plans to build in Westwood. 
</P>
<P>
Belin and Sherwood said Hammer has not attended a board meeting or museum 
function since his abrupt announcement in January, 1988, that he would 
establish his own museum for his Old Master and Impressionist paintings, his 
collection of lithographs and other works by 19th-Century French satirist 
Honore Daumier and a Leonard da Vinci manuscript. 
</P>
<P>
Hammer said at the time that he withdrew his plans to give the art to the 
county museum because he did not want the collection displayed in galleries 
named for other donors. Museum officials said Hammer made untenable demands 
that would isolate his collection from the rest of the museum. 
</P>
<P>
Belin and Sherwood said they had not heard from Hammer about the board's 
decision to formally sever ties. 
</P>
<P>
Neither Hammer nor a spokesman for his Occidental Petroleum Corp. could be 
reached for comment Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
Hammer's ties to the county museum had been strong until the recent 
disagreements. One of the museum complex buildings is named for Hammer and his 
wife, Frances. Five major paintings, including a Rembrandt, a Rubens and a 
Modigliani, were donated by the oil magnate. He was instrumental in arranging 
an exhibition of Impressionist and modern paintings from the Soviet Union, 
Belin said.

Infrequent Appearances 
</P>
<P>
Hammer never made frequent appearances at board meetings. But he did attend 
when he wanted to discuss something specific, Sherwood said. 
</P>
<P>
Even after Hammer decided to go ahead with his own museum, he told Belin that 
he hoped the two institutions could sometimes work together. 
</P>
<P>
"I told him that if he had any specific ideas, he should present them," Belin 
said. "He hasn't done that." 
</P>
<P>
Hammer also had talked of helping to bring another major exhibit from the 
Soviet Union to the county museum, Belin said. 
</P>
<P>
"I have not heard from him about that," he added.
