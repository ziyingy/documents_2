When Hurricane Hugo's 110-m.p.h winds raked this island in September, 
century-old ficus trees were uprooted, a grand piano was blasted through a 
hotel window into the angry Atlantic and the island's beloved coqui tree frog 
was temporarily silenced from barking his pistol-shot call. 
</P>
<P>
But once the first big blow in 57 years was over, tree surgeons flew in to set 
old trees back in place; broken windows were repaired; a new hotel piano was 
installed, and the fingernail-size coquis began their awesome racket anew. 
</P>
<P>
Tourist offices often adopt a cavalier attitude when disasters strike, 
determined to convince potential visitors that nothing was really disturbed. 
</P>
<P>
The fact is, San Juan was hit hard. But much of the island is essentially back 
to normal, and it takes a keen eye to spot the problems caused by Hugo's 
rampage. 
</P>
<P>
Getting here: American and Delta will fly you here without changes, other 
airlines with connections. 
</P>
<P>
How long/how much? You can do San Juan in a day or two, but stretch it to a 
week with beach time and visits to other scenic parts of this 110-mile-long 
island. Accommodation costs for the summer season are reasonable, winters not 
all that bad. It's possible to dine very well at moderate prices. 
</P>
<P>
A few fast facts: The Commonwealth of Puerto Rico is in permanent union with 
the United States, so you won't need a passport. Currency is American dollars. 
Mid-December to Easter is high season. Weather is in the balmy 70s and 80s all 
year, with short rains most prevalent in summer and fall. 
</P>
<P>
Getting settled in: The Gallery Inn (Blvd. del Valle 204; $50 double all year, 
suites $85) is an enchanting little enclave of colonial buildings in Old San 
Juan's historic section overlooking the sea. 
</P>
<P>
Several galleries and studios with artists and sculptors in residence are part 
of the inn, while the owner and his painter-sculptor wife have been pioneers in 
Old San Juan's restoration. 
</P>
<P>
The inn is a honeycomb of lush patios and gardens, trickling fountains and 
rambling stairways within, yet there are few rooms and nothing outside to 
indicate that the 17th-Century buildings are an inn. So be sure to call ahead 
to (809) 722-1808 or 725-6515, or write well in advance for reservations. 
</P>
<P>
El Canario Inn (1317 Ashford Ave.; $52 double B&amp;B, low season, $75 high) 
has a distinct Mediterranean feel in its pink building, enclosed patio and 
furnishings. Spacious bedrooms are modest in decor, but the baths are sparkling 
and modern. 
</P>
<P>
Hugo put a crack in the El Canario's pool, which is being fixed, but Condado 
Lagoon beach is only a block away. The atmosphere at the inn is informal, the 
price certainly right. 
</P>
<P>
El Convento (100 Cristo St.; $150 to $175 double, high season, $95-$125 low) is 
a 17th-Century Carmelite convent in the heart of Old San Juan. It's built 
around a long central courtyard to which a pool and restaurant have been added. 
Yet El Convento has lost a good measure of its charm since our last visit. 
</P>
<P>
Regional food and drink: Puerto Rican food is a heady blend of Spanish, African 
and Creole-Indian cooking, the last a holdover from the island's first 
inhabitants. Lunch and dinner usually begin with hot appetizers such as 
bacalaitos (cod fritters) or empanadillas (Spanish turnovers) filled with crab, 
conch or beef, perhaps yautia (taro) fritters. Then comes a thick asopao of 
rice with shellfish or chicken, more like a gumbo than soup and usually a main 
course. 
</P>
<P>
Other main courses could be roast suckling pig, bacalao (salted cod) or a 
Creole chicken dish. Plantains are served with almost everything, often as 
pastelon, a lasagna-like dish of green bananas layered with ground beef and 
spices. Bean-rice combinations are an island staple. 
</P>
<P>
Ron del Barrilito is considered the cognac of island rums, while Medalla is the 
local beer of choice. 
</P>
<P>
Dining well: Cafe-Restaurant Amadeus (San Sebastian 106) doesn't sound very 
Puerto Rican, but it's an Old San Juan hangout popular with those who want to 
dine inexpensively and well in a small, 200-year-old renovated building. The 
hors d'oeuvres are magnificent: tostones (deep-fried plantains) with caviar, 
ceviche and Brie in puff pastry with guava sauce or yautias. 
</P>
<P>
Main courses lean on inventive treatment of Italian dishes, but you may dine 
very well indeed by sticking to the hors d'oeuvres. 
</P>
<P>
Amanda's (opposite Ft. San Cristobel in Old San Juan) is probably the town's 
most romantic spot for watching sunsets while sipping a pitcher of sangria or 
rum-fruit frappe. THe interior is bright, colorful and informal, and there also 
are tables outside for dining or relaxing. The menu is a simple mix of seafood, 
steaks and chops, plus an assortment of Mexican dishes. 
</P>
<P>
Leonardo's (Sands Hotel, Isla Verde Beach) is considered by some to be the best 
restaurant in Puerto Rico. Try the fresh-shucked clams or oysters with smoked 
salmon and a cracked-pepper garnish, then move on to one of a dozen lovely 
pastas. The red snapper sauteed with olives and served over spinach with a 
lemon sauce is for the gods. There are also eight classic veal treatments. 
</P>
<P>
Going first-class: El San Juan (Avenida Isla Verde; $210 to $300 double, 
winter, $125-$245 summer) strikes one as being almost totally non-Caribbean, an 
extravagant mixture of carved-mahogany ceilings, pink marble and gigantic 
chandeliers. Stir in a little Andalusian-Mexican-Moorish and you wonder how it 
all works. 
</P>
<P>
Bedrooms have every conceivable amenity. There are several restaurants, 
including the Don Juan with marvelous Puerto Rican food. There is a good beach 
and a lively casino. 
</P>
<P>
The Normandie (Munoz Rivera Avenida; $180-$240 double, winter, $115-$160 
summer) rounds out its first half-century as the Caribbean's monument to Art 
Deco, a structure very reminiscent of the French luxury liner by the same name. 
You'll find everything first-cabin here, from gorgeous bedrooms to superb 
dining to a glass of Champagne on check-in. The Normandie exudes glamour and 
style from entry to roof. 
</P>
<P>
On your own: First order of business is a leisurely stroll through Old San 
Juan, the only remaining walled city under the American flag. Enjoy the view 
from El Morro fortress (1540). It was from there that the sea entrance to the 
town was defended. Ft. San Cristobel (1771) covers 27 acres. 
</P>
<P>
La Fortaleza was begun in 1540, and a tour of its gardens and interior is 
highly recommended, mainly for the 19th-Century restorations within the 
still-official residence of the island's governor. 
</P>
<P>
Many visitors take a ferry from the San Juan terminal across to the Bacardi rum 
distillery for a tour, history of the island's most famous product and a bit of 
free sipping. Others motor 22 miles west to Dorado and two Hyatt hotels 
boasting four 18-hole Robert Trent Jones golf courses. The beaches there are 
beautiful. 
</P>
