Accustomed to the quiet and strictly disciplined students of her native Japan, 
teaching intern Miwako Nishiyama went into culture shock when she arrived 
recently at Harold Ambuehl Elementary School and was exposed to its typical 
American students. 
</P>
<P>
"The kids are so frank and friendly," she said. "When I ask a question, the 
children all raise their hands to answer, even if they don't know the answer. 
In Japan, students hesitate to answer even if they have the knowledge because 
they are afraid to make mistakes." 
</P>
<P>
Nishiyama, a 25-year-old trading company clerk and prospective English teacher 
in her native Tokyo, arrived at Ambuehl in October for a six-month stay. Her 
internship is sponsored by the Japanese School Internship Program, a nonprofit 
group that places 200 Japanese annually as unpaid interns in American and 
Canadian schools.

<P>
Nishiyama helps Ambuehl's teachers with their regular lessons, gives 
presentations on such staples of the Japanese culture as the paper-folding art 
of origami and teaches Japanese to a group of gifted students. 
</P>
<P>
Principal Kathy George, in whose home Nishiyama is living, said she volunteered 
her school for the program because students need to learn about other cultures. 
</P>
<P>
"With the growing influence of the Pacific Rim, exposure to the Japanese is 
invaluable," she said. "And the enthusiasm of the children has been wonderful. 
Adults fear trying to learn a new language, but for the children it has been 
pure enjoyment." 
</P>
<P>
This week, Nishiyama worked with a group of six gifted students, teaching them 
how to ask for items they would find in a department store. 
</P>
<P>
And while words such as zubon (pants) and hon (book) were unfamiliar, the 
students were surprised to learn that the Japanese have borrowed English words 
such as nekutai (necktie), hankachi (handkerchief) and kamera for items not 
native to their culture. 
</P>
<P>
Students in a sixth-grade class said they were shocked when Nishiyama told them 
of life in a Japanese school. 
</P>
<P>
"She told us that if a student talks or gets out of his seat, that is 
considered an embarrassment to his family," Shawna Draper said. "That's really 
different." 
</P>
<P>
Outside of school, Nishiyama said she is enjoying American life, although she 
misses Japanese food and Tokyo's transit system. One twist, she said, was 
discovering microwaves, dishwashers and other Japanese-made kitchen gadgets 
that one never sees in Japanese homes. 
</P>
<P>
Another is the American preoccupation with holidays. 
</P>
<P>
"For Halloween and Thanksgiving, everyone was so excited," she said. "And now 
it is 'Christmas, Christmas, Christmas.' But all of this is very nice." TERRY 
SPENCER
