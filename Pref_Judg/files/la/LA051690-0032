* Bjorn Again: A Swedish news magazine must pay $12,500 to retired tennis star 
Bjorn Borg for defaming him by reporting allegations that he used cocaine.

allegations of Borg's former girlfriend, Jannicke Bjorling, who is involved in 
a custody dispute with him over the couple's son, Robin.

"What did I want to be called?," Kunin says he was asked. He didn't know. So he 
sought help from "learned scholars" who took about six months to come up with 
the title of "First Mate," as a male equivalent to First Lady. And he says he's 
been satisfied with the title ever since.

* Chairman Hope: It looks as if Anthony Hope, son of comedian Bob Hope, will be 
confirmed easily as chairman of the new Indian Gaming Commission. The 
Georgetown University and Harvard Law School graduate testified before the 
Senate Select Committee on Indian Affairs on his qualifications last week. On 
Monday, the committee recommended his confirmation as the first chairman of the 
new commission to oversee gambling on Indian reservations.

* Another Addiction: One in every 20 Italians is obsessed by sex, psychiatrist 
Piero De Giacomo told reporters Tuesday in Rome. According to a study the 
professor has completed, 5% of men and women in Italy had excessive sexual 
appetites. "For these people, sex is an end in itself. They have numerous 
partners, often more than one at the same time . . . make use of pornographic 
films and photographs and sometimes use violence in sexual relations."
