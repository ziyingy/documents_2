Royal D. Little, founder of Textron Inc. and widely known as the father of the 
modern conglomerate, died Thursday at his winter home in the Bahamas at the age 
of 92. 
</P>
<P>
Little broke new ground in the 1950s when Textron, which he had founded as a 
textile firm called Special Yarns Corp. in 1923, absorbed more than 40 smaller 
companies turning out unrelated products ranging from radar antennas to 
snowmobiles. 
</P>
<P>
This diversification program boosted Textron's sales from $99 million in 1952 
to $383 million in 1960 and earned him fame as "the man who started the whole 
conglomerate movement."

<P>
Attended Private School 
</P>
<P>
Born in Wakefield, Mass., on March 1, 1896, Little was put through Noble and 
Greenough, a prestigious Boston private school, by his wealthy uncle, Arthur D. 
Little, the well-known management consultant. The young man graduated from 
Harvard College in 1919 after service as an infantry lieutenant in France 
during World War I. 
</P>
<P>
The firm he founded in 1923 did reasonably well for about 15 years, but by 1952 
was losing money and Little was concerned at the poor rate of return it was 
earning on its substantial capital investment. 
</P>
<P>
In choosing to diversify, Little said, he was attempting to "eliminate the 
effect of business cycles on the parent company by having many divisions in 
unrelated fields." 
</P>
<P>
By 1960, the company had 29,000 employees working in 90 plants and was ranked 
124th on the Fortune 500 list of the nation's largest industrial firms. 
</P>
<P>
Looking back, Little said simply that his program "had worked." 
</P>
<P>
By then, his personal fortune was estimated at more than $20 million, but he 
still listed his annual savings as nil and was known to borrow train fare from 
friends for the trip from his home in Narragansett, R.I., to Textron's home 
offices in Providence. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Retired in 1960 
</P>
<P>
He retired as Textron's board chairman and chief executive in 1960 and devoted 
much of his energy over the next few years to building the Narragansett Capital 
Corp., the nation's largest publicly held investment company specializing in 
small businesses. He also served as board chairman of Amtel Inc., Bevis 
Industries and the American Television and Communications Corp. 
</P>
<P>
In 1979, he wrote a candid, tongue-in-cheek tribute to America's 
free-enterprise system called "How to Lose $100 Million and Other Valuable 
Advice." The book served as a "how not to" primer on entrepreneurship, sort of 
a corporate version of Aesop's Fables, complete with a "moral to the story" at 
the end of each venture described. 
</P>
<P>
He was married to Augusta Ellis in 1932. They were divorced in 1959. 
</P>
<P>
Little is survived by a son, Arthur, of Boston; a daughter, Augusta Bishop of 
Vashon Island, Wash., and four grandchildren. 
</P>
<P>
At his wish, there will be no funeral services. "No funeral," he wrote in his 
memoirs. "Hope my friends will just think I've taken a long trip."
