Former Olympic diver Bruce Kimball will serve less than five years of a 17-year 
sentence for a 1988 drunk-driving accident that killed two teen-agers, the 
Florida Parole Commission decided today. 
</P>
<P>
The commission voted to release Kimball on Nov. 24, 1993. 
</P>
<P>
That date is firm unless the case is brought back to the commission for 
disciplinary action by the Department of Corrections, parole spokeswoman Ruth 
Anne Reese said. 
</P>
<P>
Kimball, who pleaded guilty to two manslaughter charges, has served about 22 
months of his sentence for the Aug. 1, 1988, drunk-driving accident that killed 
two and seriously injured three. 
</P>
<P>
A silver medalist in 1984, Kimball was in training for the 1988 Olympics. At 
the time of the accident, he had a blood-alcohol level twice the legal limit.
