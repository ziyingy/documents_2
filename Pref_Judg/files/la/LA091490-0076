The Florida Supreme Court ruled Thursday that relatives or guardians can order 
the removal of feeding tubes that keep brain-damaged people alive, even if the 
patients have not signed "living wills." 
</P>
<P>
The justices said the guardians do not need a court's approval in each 
individual case. 
</P>
<P>
However, the patient must have expressed, at least verbally, a preference for 
dying rather than being kept alive with feeding tubes. 
</P>
<P>
The foundation of the "right-to-die" decision, which came in the case of an 
89-year-old woman who died last summer, is the right to privacy in the state 
constitution. 
</P>
<P>
"This case resolves a question of an individual's constitutional right of 
self-determination," Justice Rosemary Barkett wrote in the majority opinion. 
</P>
<P>
The woman at the center of the case, Estelle Browning, spent the last 2 1/2 
years of her life hooked up to feeding tubes that she had earlier, in a "living 
will," said she did not want. 
</P>
<P>
She suffered permanent brain damage in a stroke and was left in a vegetative 
state, unable to swallow or communicate. She was not comatose. Doris Herbert, 
Browning's second cousin and only living relative, was named her guardian. 
</P>
<P>
Herbert sought permission to remove the tubes in 1988. The state fought the 
request and a trial court denied it. But a state appeals court said the state's 
constitution allowed it, and the issue was reviewed by the Supreme Court.
