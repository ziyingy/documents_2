Law enforcement officials have warned five prominent New Yorkers that their 
names were found on a list kept by the man accused of killing radical Zionist 
Meir Kahane, it was reported today. 
</P>
<P>
Rep. Gary L. Ackerman (D-N.Y.), two federal judges, a former assistant U.S. 
attorney and a columnist for the weekly Jewish Press were on the list, Newsday 
said.

<P>
Some of those on the list found in El Sayyid A. Nosair's Cliffside Park, N.J., 
home were involved in the extradition from Venezuela through Brooklyn of 
terrorist suspect Abdul Atta, a Muslim linked to a terrorist group, the 
newspaper said.

<P>
Neither police nor the FBI would comment on the report. 
</P>

FBI officials have said they believe that Nosair acted alone when he gunned 
down Kahane during a Nov. 5 conference in New York City but are still trying to 
determine if he was backed by a terrorist group.
