Robberies in the last week at two San Fernando Valley travel agencies -- 
including one in which an owner was fatally shot -- are believed to be part of 
a series of similar robberies in which the thieves have taken blank airline 
tickets worth hundreds of thousands of dollars, Los Angeles police said 
Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
Detectives said robbers armed with handguns have taken cash and tickets from at 
least 20 travel agencies throughout Los Angeles County since the beginning of 
the year, but no shots had been fired until Friday, when the owner of a Van 
Nuys agency was shot during an afternoon robbery. 
</P>
<P>
Police said Hernan Vacha was shot once in the upper body during the robbery at 
Excelsior Travel &amp; Tours in the 14400 block of Victory Boulevard, about two 
blocks from the Van Nuys police station. Vacha, 46, died Saturday night at 
Valley Medical Center in Van Nuys.

No Arrests

<P>
No arrests had been made in the slaying or the robberies. The latest was 
committed by three armed men who took an undisclosed amount of cash and blank 
tickets Monday from Ampavera Tours &amp; Travel in the 18600 block of Sherman 
Way in Canoga Park.

The Valley robberies featured a new level of violence in the robberies and 
enlarged the area in which businesses have been victimized, police said. In the 
past, robberies have occurred as far south as Inglewood and as far east as El 
Monte. Although some occurred as far north as Van Nuys, most took place south 
of the Valley. The Canoga Park robbery was the first in the West Valley. 
</P>
<P>
"This is a new thing and it is escalating," Detective Larry Hedwall said. "We 
have had numerous robberies all over the county since the end of last year." 
</P>
<P>
In most cases, two or three armed robbers entered the businesses during daytime 
hours and took cash and tickets after threatening employees. Police said they 
have received several different descriptions from victims, leading them to 
believe that different but possibly linked groups of robbers are involved.

Selling Methods 
</P>
<P>
The links between the robbers may be in the methods or individuals used to sell 
the blank tickets, detectives said. 
</P>
<P>
Forgery Detective Bob Hill said stolen tickets are routinely sold to 
unsuspecting travelers through newspaper ads or in bulk quantities to networks 
that arrange travel for illegal aliens who have been smuggled into Southern 
California and are heading east. He said tickets stolen from Los Angeles 
agencies have also been traced to Europe where they were distributed. 
</P>
<P>
Hill said that thieves use sophisticated methods, including computer printers, 
stolen airline stamps and knowledge of airline ticket coding, to fill out the 
blank airline tickets for specific flights -- often expensive routes that bring 
more profit to the thieves. Phony reservations are then made with the airlines 
to make sure that seats are open on the flights. 
</P>
<P>
Those who travel on the tickets often do not know that they have been stolen, 
he said, although some of those who buy tickets through classified ads are told 
that they are legitimate cut-rate tickets -- which airlines specify cannot be 
resold -- and so the buyer must fly under the identity of the "original 
purchaser." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Computer Checks 
</P>
<P>
Users of the tickets usually are not stopped at airports unless airline 
employees take the time to run computer checks on the serial numbers of their 
tickets, Hill said. Rarely are the actual thieves arrested. The airlines -- or 
passengers notified at the last moment that their tickets are invalid -- suffer 
the loss, he said. 
</P>
<P>
Hill said that for years thieves have used various ruses to steal small amounts 
of blank tickets from travel agencies, but the rash of armed robberies this 
year is a disturbing and dangerous new trend that has largely grown out of the 
lucrative market for the tickets. 
</P>
<P>
He said that the travel agencies robbed this year usually had 100 to 250 blank 
tickets stolen and that those recovered after use indicate the thieves profit 
an average of $1,000 from each one. 
</P>
<P>
"The losses can be staggering," he said. "The airlines could lose $100,000 in 
each robbery."
