Your editorial cites a few recent events and then calls for "more effective gun 
legislation." 
</P>

There are already laws against everything you mentioned. It is illegal to "pack 
a piece," to threaten anyone with a gun, to shoot guns in public, etc. Most 
gang members have criminal records preventing them from legally even owning a 
gun.

Our problem is not needing more laws -- it is enforcement of existing laws. 
Tougher judges, more prisons, the death penalty, etc. are the solutions. Why 
doesn't The Times take the lead on these issues? Without enforcement and 
punishment, laws are useless. Our gang and drug problems are proof of that.
