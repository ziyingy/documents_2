Costa Mesa City Council this week approved a plan to build a $45-million 
shopping and entertainment center downtown, despite the protests of several 
small-business owners who must move. 
</P>
<P>
The council voted 4 to 1 for the Mediterranean-style Triangle Square complex at 
Harbor and Newport boulevards. The council also voted to condemn the properties 
of at least 13 small businesses on the 4.5-acre site to make room for the 
complex. 
</P>
<P>
Councilwoman Sandra L. Genis, the only member to vote against condemning the 
properties, argued that the small businesses are needed and should not be razed 
to benefit the city. 
</P>
<P>
Several of the business owners said the purchase and relocation offers made by 
Triangle Square Associates, co-developer of the project, were inadequate. 
Others argued that, after investing thousands of dollars in their businesses, 
they should not have to uproot themselves for an upscale shopping center.

<P>
"This is one of the nicest stores we have, and I don't know where we would move 
and pay the rents we are paying now," said Mic Mead, owner of the six-store 
Adventure 16 Outdoor chain, whose Costa Mesa store is on Harbor Boulevard.

<P>
City officials said, however, that the new complex will improve the appearance 
of the city's downtown redevelopment area and compared the project to San 
Francisco's Ghirardelli Square. 
</P>
<P>
Officials also said the Triangle Square project will generate about $1 million 
in taxes annually. 
</P>
<P>
The 185,000-square-foot project will include two aboveground levels of shops 
and restaurants and a subterranean level that will include a supermarket. Also 
included in the plan is a 2,200-seat, eight-screen Cineplex-Odeon movie 
theater, the first in the county. 
</P>
<P>
"We feel that Triangle Square is the most significant and innovative retail 
development to be announced in Orange County this year," said Jerry Klein, a 
spokesman for Triangle Square Associates. 
</P>
<P>
Klein said he expects demolition to begin as early as this fall, with the 
complex completed by early 1991.
