<P>
In 1985, the timber giant Weyerhaeuser Co. set up a real estate investment 
trust named Mortgage Investments Plus, based in Woodland Hills, as part of its 
expansion into financial services. 
</P>
<P>
Such trusts, known as REITs, sell stock to the public and invest the proceeds 
in real estate, typically commercial properties. Some investors like REITs 
because REITs avoid paying federal income tax by distributing 95% of their 
income to stockholders in the form of dividends. 
</P>
<P>
MIP raised about $90 million from its stock sale and began investing in new 
office buildings and other commercial properties under development in 
California. Weyerhaeuser, meanwhile, continued supporting MIP by providing it 
with administrative and advisory services, and collected a fee for its trouble. 
</P>
<P>
But four years later, it is questionable whether MIP is worth the trouble any 
longer for Weyerhaeuser. The Tacoma, Wash.-based timber concern earned $564 
million last year on sales of $10 billion. But MIP's fees kicked in a mere $1 
million of Weyerhaeuser's sales. Although MIP is profitable -- it earned $4.3 
million on revenue of $10.1 million last year -- Lawrence W. Farmer, MIP's 
president, acknowledged that MIP barely covered Weyerhaeuser's costs of helping 
MIP to operate. Farmer added that MIP "has not been real profitable for" 
Weyerhaeuser. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
'Sharpen Its Focus' 
</P>
<P>
And a big change might be coming for MIP. Weyerhaeuser recently announced that 
it wants to "sharpen its strategic focus" in the 1990s. Translation: It might 
stick with forest products and reduce its role in mortgage banking, real estate 
and other financial services. 
</P>
<P>
For now, Weyerhaeuser's commitment to MIP is intact, but longer term "it's hard 
to comment at this point," said Don Lange, president of Weyerhaeuser Mortgage, 
the Weyerhaeuser unit that deals with MIP. 
</P>
<P>
What happens if Weyerhaeuser tires of MIP's current setup? Weyerhaeuser could 
cut MIP adrift, perhaps forcing the firm to liquidate its properties. Or 
Weyerhaeuser might buy out MIP's stockholders and merge the firm into its own 
operations. 
</P>
<P>
Weyerhaeuser's role is important because it does most of MIP's legwork in real 
estate transactions, and all of MIP's officers are Weyerhaeuser employees. If 
MIP had its own staff today, its overhead costs would be too high and leave 
little room for profit, Farmer said. 
</P>
<P>
Farmer indicated another potential solution: MIP could survive on its own, with 
Farmer and other Weyerhaeuser employees becoming employees of MIP. Farmer said 
that if MIP could find a cost-efficient way of running its business itself, 
Weyerhaeuser "would not oppose that." 
</P>
<P>
So Farmer has begun planning on how MIP could generate more business to support 
its own payroll. Farmer, a 53-year-old ex-Marine, thinks MIP can do that with 
its new strategy, under which it will reduce its investments in buildings under 
construction and instead focus on the properties it already has or on buying 
existing properties. 
</P>
<P>
What's the difference between old and new buildings? Investing in new 
developments carries certain risks. Construction could be delayed or MIP and 
its partners -- many of MIP's projects are joint ventures -- could have trouble 
finding tenants to lease its new buildings. Either would delay MIP's ability to 
collect rental income. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Existing Buildings 
</P>
<P>
Existing buildings often are already leased. That lets the owner focus on 
improving the site -- be it changing a building's landscape, its tenant mix or 
the terms of the tenants' leases -- to boost rental income and increase the 
REIT's return on investment. 
</P>
<P>
If MIP is out on its own, Farmer must do something to boost his company's 
appeal to investors. Unless MIP can find a way to increase its stock price, 
it's unlikely the trust can return to the market and raise money by issuing 
more stock. Yet the cash from selling more stock might be the only way MIP can 
grow faster. 
</P>
<P>
Thus far, MIP's stock has never climbed back above its initial price of $10 a 
share in 1985. The stock, which closed Monday at $7.625 a share on the American 
Stock Exchange, is virtually unchanged so far this year. 
</P>
<P>
"The market wants to see growth in cash flow," said Rita R. Dominguez, an 
analyst at Merrill Lynch &amp; Co. "That's what it will reward. We really don't 
see that at MIP." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Cash Flow 
</P>
<P>
Cash flow is vital because investors pay close attention to a REIT's dividends, 
and the dividends are determined by how much cash flow -- that is, interest 
income on its loans, fee income and rental income -- a REIT generates each 
year. 
</P>
<P>
In the mid-1970s, REITs got a bad reputation when, during the recession, many 
of them collapsed from poor management, bad loans and other maladies that cost 
investors billions of dollars. When Weyerhaeuser set up MIP in 1985, REITs had 
begun to come back into favor, in part because tax reform was about to crimp 
the advantages of other real estate investments. 
</P>
<P>
But MIP's record hasn't been the best. In the four years that ended May 31, the 
average annual total return (stock appreciation plus dividends) for REIT 
industry stocks was 3.9%, said Christopher Lucas, research director for the 
National Assn. of Real Estate Investor Trusts, a Washington trade group. But 
MIP's average return was a meager 1.6%. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Young Company 
</P>
<P>
To be sure, MIP is still a young company and many of the REITs against which it 
is compared are older, have bigger portfolios of properties and a history of 
steady dividend growth. Given more time, MIP also might bolster its results, 
particularly because it will be able to start selling some of its holdings next 
year. Under IRS rules, REITs must hold properties at least four years before 
they sell them, and MIP's original investments will reach that threshold next 
year, Farmer said. 
</P>
<P>
In the meantime, Farmer also is moving MIP away from developing office 
buildings and more toward investments in industrial and regional shopping 
centers. The latter two are easier to rent and are less time-consuming and 
costly to build, he said. 
</P>
<P>
So, in addition to being a part-owner of such office complexes as the San Diego 
Corporate Center and the Ontario Business Center, MIP now has interests in such 
retail centers as the Sunwest Retail Plaza in San Bernardino and the Mart of 
Montebello. 
</P>
<P>
With this strategy, Farmer is trying to emulate a successful REIT such as 
Burnham Pacific Properties in San Diego. Since being converted from a 
partnership to a REIT in April, 1987, Burnham Pacific has raised $60 million in 
two stock offerings, raised its dividend eight out the last 10 quarters and has 
its stock trading 25% above its initial price. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Track Record 
</P>
<P>
To be sure, Burnham Pacific has a much longer track record than MIP. Burnham 
Pacific is affiliated with John Burnham &amp; Co., a 98-year-old real estate 
and mortgage services concern in San Diego. 
</P>
<P>
But Louis J. Garday, Burnham Pacific's president, said his firm has 
outperformed MIP because it invests in existing properties and then tries to 
improve those properties and increase the rental income they generate. By 
contrast, MIP generally earns a fixed return on its money while its new 
buildings are being developed, he said. 
</P>
<P>
"MIP has some properties I would love to own," Garday said. "But the stock 
market doesn't seem to be as patient with that format." 
</P>
