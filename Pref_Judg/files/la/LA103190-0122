Odetics Inc. said Tuesday that it has won a $34-million contract to build a 
robot-controlled tape "library" for a huge supercomputer data storage system 
being developed by E-Systems Inc., a Dallas electronics company. 
</P>
<P>
Under a six-year contract, Odetics will make a robot system that will store and 
retrieve data within a giant storage system capable of holding the equivalent 
of a copy of Margaret Mitchell's "Gone With the Wind" for every person in the 
world. 
</P>
<P>
The contract is a continuation of earlier work that Odetics did for E-Systems 
under a $6-million award. 
</P>
<P>
The most sophisticated version of E-Systems' storage system will store more 
than 10,000 terabytes of information. One terabyte equals 1 trillion bytes of 
data. 
</P>
<P>
E-Systems plans to market the system to government agencies and companies that 
operate large information databases. 
</P>
<P>
The Dallas firm expects to market a small version of the system in 1991 and a 
more sophisticated one by 1993. 
</P>
<P>
The system would have 1,000 times more storage capacity than current systems 
made by Storage Technology Corp., of Louisville, Colo., said Richard Petit, 
general manager of Odetics' commercial products division. 
</P>
<P>
Odetics Chairman Joel Slutzky said the company estimates the market for 
supercomputer storage systems will reach $3 billion by 1995. 
</P>
<P>
Odetics' share of that overall market could be $100 million a year beginning in 
1991, Petit said. Odetics now employs 27 people on the project and expects to 
hire 10 more during the next year, he said. 
</P>
<P>
The E-Systems project is based on technology used in the automated videotape 
storage systems that Odetics supplies to television stations. 
</P>
<P>
But while the machines that Odetics makes for the broadcast industry can store 
and retrieve 280 videotapes, the new system would access thousands of computer 
cassettes in a storage area the length of an 80-foot hallway. 
</P>
<P>
The heart of the Odetics supercomputer system is a network of self-propelled or 
robotic arms that transfer cassettes from place to place at speeds up to 9 feet 
per second. 
</P>
<P>
Mike Klatman, spokesman for Storage Technology, said his company is looking 
into the technology. 
</P>
<P>
But the Dallas firm's system, he said, would appeal more to a small "fringe of 
scientific users who require massive amounts of data" rather than the average 
corporate customer. 
</P>
<P>
But Odetics' Petit said E-Systems already has lined up some government and 
commercial customers, including one large oil company. 
</P>
<P>
Other potential customers might include banks, insurance companies and major 
scientific and research institutions. 
</P>

<P>
Robots Serve Up Data For Supercomputers 
</P>
<P>
A team of self-propelled robots made by Odetics Inc. of Anaheim keep order in a 
library of up to135,000 computer-storage tape cassettes. Bar code scanners 
identify cassettes, which are then pl19694498291. Odetics' mobile robot 
retrieves tape cartridge from library rack and delivers it to cassette module. 
</P>
<P>
2. Cassette module loads the tape into tape drive.
