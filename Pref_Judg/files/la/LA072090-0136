This small (population 6,248) port city in Southern France has a definite 
fashion look this summer. Clothes are short, tight and sexy. 
</P>
<P>
Dresses in floral prints, cyclist shorts in polka-dots and anything else that 
stretches and snuggles up to a body is the right idea for the city streets. 
</P>
<P>
Out at the beach there are more one-piece swimsuits than ever, which do double 
duty back in town as body suits under leggings or bike shorts. 
</P>
<P>
The glamour touch is metallic shoes and handbags: gold leather ballerinas and 
huge gold totes or quilted shoulder bags, even with the most pared-down 
sportswear looks.

There is no shortage of famous fashion faces around town. Italian designer 
Valentino's low-to-the-water, navy blue yacht, Blue One, inches into port with 
Valentino's partner, Giancarlo Giammetti, anxiously surveying the maneuvers. 
Giammetti wears a blue-and-white-striped robe while Valentino lounges on the 
top deck in a yellow Shetland and white trousers during the stressful 
procedure. Meanwhile, Greek shipping magnate Stavros Niarchos is dropping 
anchor in the open water facing the port -- his yacht is too big for the port 
facilities.

Portside fashion here often resembles a parade of bad taste, but this season 
there's a fanciful look centered around cropped-at-the-knee floral overalls, 
white T-shirts and white tennis shoes. Or there's an ultra-sexy summer look 
with stretch leggings in brilliant prints or bike shorts revealing more body 
than the shortest shorts or minis. PATRICIA McCOLL
