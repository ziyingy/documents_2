A "gang of marauding sea lions" has discovered that there is such a thing as a 
free lunch 1,500 miles from their California home, touching off a political 
battle that could spell slaughter for dozens of the animals under the very law 
designed to protect them. 
</P>
<P>
Washington state officials have spent five years and hundreds of thousands of 
dollars trying to keep the flippered freeloaders from decimating a prized run 
of wild steelhead trout in a shipping channel between Puget Sound and Lake 
Washington. 
</P>
<P>
Rock music, killer whale recordings, tainted fish and 6,000 rounds of M-80 
firecrackers so far have failed to discourage the 40 to 60 sea lions who 
consider the man-made fish ladder at Ballard Locks their private smorgasbord. 
</P>
<P>
"We're at the bottom of our bag of tricks relative to non-lethal measures," 
admitted Joe Scordino, deputy director of the northwest regional offices of the 
National Marine Fisheries Service, which has jurisdiction over the animals. 
</P>
<P>
This year, Washington is hoping to get $170,000 in federal funding to capture 
the sea lions and truck them home to the Channel Islands off Santa Barbara, but 
California is balking at the plan, even suggesting at one point that shooting 
the sea lions would be a preferable solution. 
</P>
<P>
Washington fish and wildlife officials are now combing the National Marine 
Mammals Protection Act for legal loopholes that would allow them to do just 
that as a last resort -- a precedent that could dramatically alter 
interpretation of the 1972 law. 
</P>
<P>
The fight over the fate of the creatures Seattle fans generically nicknamed 
"Herschel" is considered unique because it makes man both the instigator and 
the mediator in a conflict between two wild species. 
</P>
<P>
Some say the dwindling steelhead run represents far more than a convenient 
recreational opportunity for local anglers, or a modest income for the two 
Indian tribes whose treaty rights permit commercial trout fishing. 
</P>
<P>
"The greatest value of that run is as an environmental barometer," said Bob 
Byrne, spokesman for the Washington Department of Wildlife, which oversees the 
steelhead. "It serves as a miner's canary on how we treat our environment. As 
long as the fish live, it must be relatively clean. 
</P>
<P>
"Yes, there are other steelhead runs in other places. But there's a danger in 
that argument . . . . Then you can say 'let me cut this tree or pollute this 
stream -- there's always more,' " he said. 
</P>
<P>
But some environmentalists disagree that sea lions are the culprit in the Case 
of the Disappearing Fish. 
</P>
<P>
"Different things are adding to the steelhead decline," said local Greenpeace 
spokeswoman Cynthia Rust. "Habitat destruction, for example. In Seattle, you 
can go to a couple of places where you used to see a spawning stream and find a 
parking lot or mall. 
</P>
<P>
"There's also pollution, and interception of the run by high sea drift-net 
fleets from Japan, Taiwan and Korea," she said. "One Taiwanese vessel was 
apprehended and 4,000 tons of illegal salmon were found in the hold." 
</P>
<P>
Nevertheless, over the years, the sea lions have grown in both number and girth 
at Ballard Locks, devouring up to 64% of a year's steelhead run -- as many as 
2,000 of the large fish. The run peaks from mid-February to mid-March. 
</P>
<P>
The locks and dam were built nearly 80 years ago to control the water level in 
Lake Washington and provide ship and barge traffic between Lake Washington, 
Lake Union and Puget Sound. Part of the channel floor is concrete, and the rest 
is scoured clean for ship traffic. There are no kelp beds or other natural 
hiding places for the migrating fish. 
</P>
<P>
One theory for the sea lions' sudden appearance at Ballard Locks is that they 
began following large schools of fish moving northward with the warming waters 
of El Nino several years ago. 
</P>
<P>
Because the locks mark the convergence of fresh and salt water, the fish mill 
downstream while undergoing physiological changes for their freshwater 
migration over the man-made "ladder" of ascending pools which will take them 
around the dam to their spawning streams. 
</P>
<P>
"The fish are sort of in a trance," explained Rust, the spokeswoman for 
Greenpeace, which advocates a physical barrier such as old tires to give the 
fish cover on their way to the ladder. 
</P>
<P>
"The steelhead are maybe slower than usual, and they are single-minded about 
getting upstream despite a predator in the area," she said. 
</P>
<P>
The sea lions are equally determined. 
</P>
<P>
Byrne said he has seen one sea lion alone gobble 16 steelhead in a single day. 
</P>
<P>
"Those sea lions run 900 pounds. They're the size of three Brian Bosworths -- 
three middle linebackers. They need to eat 5% of their body weight a day. They 
want the easy life and they've found it at Ballard Locks." 
</P>
<P>
Although most of the sea lions hunt at the mouth of the locks, about a dozen 
swim right past the ships to take up position at the entrance to the fish 
ladder, where the confused fish wait for the water flow to pull them into the 
system of pools. On a recent day, three of the sea lions frolicked in the water 
spilling from the dam. "The fish are running a sea lion gauntlet," Byrne said. 
</P>
<P>
Passions run so high here that wildlife officials received serious death 
threats last year when they suggested firing rubber bullets at the sea lions to 
drive them off; they are bracing for another outcry this year if an experiment 
with rubber arrows is carried out. On the other hand, fishermen have been known 
to paint "Kill Herschel" signs on their boats. 
</P>
<P>
The Marine Mammals Protection Act allows fishermen to kill the animals if 
necessary to protect their catch and gear, but there is no clear-cut provision 
for state officials to do the same to protect a fish run. 
</P>
<P>
The possible loophole is a provision for destroying marine mammals that 
threaten public resources and welfare. Washington officials are hoping that the 
steelhead run at Ballard Locks might be considered a public resource, even 
though steelhead themselves are not considered an endangered species. 
</P>
<P>
Public hearings on the controversy usually degenerate into shouting matches 
between angry fishermen and environmentalists, and hundreds of solutions -- 
most of them unfeasible -- have poured in from concerned citizens. 
</P>
<P>
"We've had some doozies," Scordino said. 
</P>
<P>
There were people who suggested introducing polar bears to the Locks, which are 
in a park flanking a residential neighborhood about five minutes from downtown 
Seattle. Others wanted to use helicopters to help the steelhead trout escape by 
airlifting them over the small dam. Some firm tried to peddle its chemical 
compound, which turned out to be a derivative of nerve gas. 
</P>
<P>
"People say to pour vinegar in the water, or have the Eskimos come talk to the 
sea lions, or put killer whales in the channel," Scordino said. 
</P>
<P>
A net barrier didn't work, and neither did an acoustical assault with the sea 
lion equivalent of fingernails on a blackboard. 
</P>
<P>
Now, a team of 18 engineers and biologists is studying ways to alter the locks 
and give the fish a fighting chance, but such a permanent solution is expected 
to take years of study and design, not to mention millions of dollars. The Army 
Corps of Engineers must approve -- and probably fund -- any structural changes. 
</P>
<P>
Last year, wildlife officials captured and tagged 39 of the sea lions. The 
tranquilizers killed two, but the remaining 37 were turned loose 300 miles down 
the Washington coast. Twenty-nine showed up again in time for Sunday brunch at 
Ballard Locks. 
</P>
<P>
Biologists say the sea lions are young unmated males who migrate from their 
breeding grounds in the Channel Islands of California when romance fails to 
bloom. They usually head back in May, though a few are beginning to hang around 
Seattle year-round. Eleven of the tagged animals were spotted in the Channel 
Islands during pup counts last summer. 
</P>
<P>
The relocation plan would basically put the sea lions back in the Channel 
Islands two months ahead of their natural calendar, and make the swim back to 
Ballard Locks long enough for the peak steelhead season to pass, according to 
Washington officials. 
</P>
<P>
But California fishermen and state agencies complain that this would merely 
transfer nuisance animals from one place to another without solving the 
problem. 
</P>
<P>
In a recent letter to the California Coastal Commission, the Pacific Coast 
Federation of Fishermen's Associations bitterly objected to the proposed 
transfer of what it dubbed "a gang of marauding sea lions." 
</P>
<P>
"California sea lions are not (permanent) residents of California," wrote 
executive director Zeke Grader, Jr. "California sea lions have historically 
ranged along the whole Pacific Coast. 
</P>
<P>
"The animal is not some sex offender that can be sent back," he continued. 
"Frankly, the proposal smacks of the California bashing that is all too 
fashionable currently in the state of Washington." 
</P>
<P>
No lawsuits have been filed, but California officials privately say they will 
go to court to block the sea lions' return. 
</P>
<P>
While they agree that 60 sea lions would not make much difference in a 
year-round population of some 80,000, California officials and fishermen worry 
that relocation could open the door for turning the state into a dumping ground 
for problem animals. 
</P>
<P>
Pete Bontadelli, director of the California Department of Fish and Game, told 
Washington officials in a letter last July that the department opposed shifting 
the problem "from one area to another." 
</P>
<P>
"We recognize that available non-lethal options to deal with this problem have 
proven ineffective to date," he wrote. "Therefore, lethal removal of the 
problem animals may be the only practical and effective long-term solution." 
</P>
<P>
Bontadelli could not be reached for further comment. 
</P>
<P>
The California Coastal Commission, going against its own staff findings that a 
sea lion transfer would be harmless, opposed it on similar grounds. 
</P>
<P>
"We believe they should deal with a Washington problem in Washington," said Hal 
Cribbs, executive secretary for the commission. "We're not shipping our 
problems up there." 
</P>
<P>
But whether California has any real say in the matter may also be a matter for 
courts to decide, since the final decision now rests with the National Marine 
Fisheries Service, a federal body. 
</P>
<P>
And California's concerns "aren't realistic," Byrne charged. "They're problem 
animals specific to Ballard Locks. If they were threatening a resource in 
California, they'd stay in California. It's a 1,500-mile trip." 
</P>
<P>
"We've pretty well eliminated easy, inexpensive and low-risk options," the 
Wildlife Department spokesman added. "And we're certainly not willing to give 
up those steelhead." 
</P>
