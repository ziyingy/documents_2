The City Council has passed a resolution supporting the Los Angeles County 
Beaches, Wildlife and Park Land Conservation Act, which would provide about 
$750 million in general bonds for local parklands.

If the measure makes the November ballot and is approved, Beverly Hills would 
receive about $560,000 and would be eligible for part of a $50-million grant 
program for park projects.
