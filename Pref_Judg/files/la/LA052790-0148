<P>
With five Republicans pursuing the GOP nomination in the 58th Assembly 
District, their primary race has evolved into an often-frustrating search for 
money and a sometimes-scrappy quest for identity. 
</P>
<P>
Like the predominantly Republican coastal district they seek to represent, the 
candidates are split between Los Angeles and Orange counties. Three -- City 
Council members Jan Hall and Jeffrey Kellogg, and physician Seymour (Sy) Alban 
-- are from Long Beach. The Orange County contenders, developer Peter von Elten 
and Mayor Thomas J. Mays, are from Huntington Beach. 
</P>
<P>
The winner of the Republican primary will face Democrat Luanne W. Pryor and 
Libertarian Scott Stier in November. Democrat Joel R. Bishop will be listed on 
the primary ballot, but he has withdrawn from the race. 
</P>
<P>
All five of the Republicans were hampered by Los Alamitos Republican Dennis 
Brown's unexpected and late announcement that he would rather do God's bidding 
than continue in the seat he has held for 12 years. Since then, Brown, who is 
studying to be a lay minister, has declined to become involved in the June 5 
primary leaving his would-be heirs to fend for themselves. 
</P>
<P>
Mays and Von Elten have in particular have engaged in an exchange of 
finger-pointing regarding their ties to special interests and their 
fund-raising efforts, while Alban, one of the best financed of the candidates, 
has gone after Kellogg and Mays with a flurry of mailers assailing their stands 
on abortion. 
</P>
<P>
A freshman councilman with celebrity good looks, Kellogg has been hobbled by a 
lack of money and a ruptured Achilles' tendon that has left him limping through 
his campaign wearing a cast. 
</P>
<P>
Hall, a 12-year veteran of the City Council and former director of the Southern 
California Rapid Transit District (RTD), has also been hurt by a low campaign 
budget in a city where three local runoffs are soaking up campaign 
contributions and diverting them from the Assembly race. 
</P>
<P>
"It's tough," lamented Hall, whose 3rd District base of support is one of those 
areas engaged in an expensive runoff match between the two men who want to 
replace her on the council. 
</P>
<P>
Alban, a prosperous 66-year-old orthopedic surgeon, and Von Elten are pouring 
their own money into their campaigns, giving them an advantage over their less 
well-heeled competitors. Hall, 47, recently joked with a tinge of envy that 
Alban was sending out so many mailers that he must own a printing press. 
</P>
<P>
The boyish-looking Mays has attacked von Elten for a dinner hosted by two 
Orange County planning commissioners who entertained representatives of South 
Orange County developers whose projects must receive commission approval. 
</P>
<P>
Von Elten in turn has blasted Mays for a fund-raiser held at the home of a 
Huntington Beach planning commissioner and attended by about 90 people, 
including a major developer with a project due to come before the commission. 
</P>
<P>
Von Elten accused Mays of engaging in a "developer shakedown," by allowing the 
$150-a-couple event to be held at the home of Huntington Beach Planning 
Commissioner Kenneth Bourguignon. 
</P>
<P>
"The only thing (Bourguignon) did was provide his home and some hors d'oeuvres 
and that was it," Mays responded, insisting that the fund-raiser "was 
aboveboard. . . . It was strictly put on by COR-PAC," the conservative 
Republican Political Action Committee. Mays also got an from the Huntington 
Beach city attorney indicating that the dinner was not improper. 
</P>
<P>
Von Elten too defends his event. "I maintain there was nothing wrong with what 
I did. . . . It was simply an opportunity to meet me and get to know me. . . . 
Mine was not a fund-raiser where any money was requested, no money was given to 
me, and I have yet to receive any money." 
</P>
<P>
Mays, a 36-year-old analyst for McDonnell Douglas Space Systems Co., has 
charged that Alban and Von Elten would have difficulty acting independently in 
the Assembly because of the financial support they are receiving. Mays asserted 
that Alban will be compromised by money from the medical community, while von 
Elten, executive vice president and general counsel of Mola Development Corp. 
in Newport Beach, will be under the sway of the development community. 
</P>
<P>
Von Elten, 46, has fired back by branding Mays a hypocrite who has, during his 
four-year Huntington Beach council career, been helped extensively by 
development interests that have contributed directly to his campaigns and 
mounted independent campaigns on his behalf. 
</P>
<P>
Alban's mailers have infuriated Kellogg, who grumbles that Alban is distorting 
his positions on oil drilling and abortion. Alban has repeatedly characterized 
Kellogg as anti-abortion because Kellogg personally opposes abortion and 
opposes government funding of abortions. But Kellogg, a 36-year-old Roman 
Catholic, has consistently said he would not vote to outlaw abortion. 
</P>
<P>
Alban, probably the most liberal of the five contenders, says he has targeted 
Mays and Alban because their conservative stands differ the most dramatically 
from his. 
</P>
<P>
"It's not pro-choice if it's pro-choice only for those who can afford it," 
Alban said, explaining his attacks on Kellogg. 
</P>
<P>
In the wake of last winter's oil spill off the coast of Huntington Beach, all 
the contenders are portraying themselves as environmentalists. Mays was lauded 
for his involvement in cleanup efforts as Huntington Beach's mayor, but it is 
Alban who has picked up the endorsement of the California League of 
Conservation Voters, an environmental group that rates politicians on their 
environmental positions and votes. 
</P>
<P>
So important is the 58th District race to the league that the organization has 
loaned a full-time worker to Alban's campaign. Alban was one of three 58th 
District candidates interviewed by the conservation league, which rated Brown's 
record as the worst in the Assembly. Neither Hall nor Kellogg responded to a 
questionnaire, said the league's Southern California director, Paul Koretz. Of 
the three who did, Koretz said they "all seemed decent enough on the 
environment" and all would be a vast improvement over Brown. 
</P>
<P>
Koretz said Mays responded very effectively to the oil spill that soiled his 
beach town but said the league ranked him below Alban because he had failed to 
demonstrate environmental leadership on the council until the spill occurred. 
</P>
<P>
Alban is mounting his first political campaign at a time when most people 
retire -- 66. 
</P>
<P>
His age has prompted by another candidate to make snide remarks about going to 
Sacramento to retire, but Alban counters that it can only be an asset that he 
doesn't want to be a career politician. Furthermore, he says no legislator 
should serve more than three terms. 
</P>
<P>
Hall's nine-year RTD tenure gives her name recognition, although not all of it 
is favorable. Widely praised by her board colleagues as a tough and bright 
director, her departure from RTD earlier this year stirred up controversy when 
she immediately took a job as a private consultant lobbying on behalf of the 
transit district. 
</P>
<P>
The board, stung by criticism, canceled the contract, although Hall remained 
with CBC Consulting Inc. of Torrance, a small firm that primarily helps 
developers obtain government permits.

environmental proposal on the November ballot that would phase out 
cancer-causing pesticides, protect redwood forests and require efforts to slow 
global warming? 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Seymour (Sy) Alban: Supports much of the initiative but would vote against it, 
because of concerns that it will hurt state agriculture and because it is 
co-sponsored by the Democratic gubernatorial candidate, Atty. Gen. John K. Van 
de Kamp. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Jan Hall: Supports it. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Jeffrey Kellogg: Opposes it because of Van de Kamp's involvement.

</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Do you support prohibiting the sale of assault weapons? 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Seymour (Sy) Alban: Yes. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Jan Hall: Yes. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Jeffrey Kellogg: No. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Thomas J. Mays: Probably, although generally opposes gun control. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Peter von Elten: Yes. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Would you require employers with five or more full-time employees to provide 
them with basic health care coverage? 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Seymour (Sy) Alban: Yes, and might support giving those employers state tax 
credits. Would also consider providing health insurance to the unemployed, 
perhaps financed by increased alcohol taxes. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Jan Hall: Yes, and might give the employers state tax credits. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Jeffrey Kellogg: No. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Thomas J. Mays: "I don't know." Says a task force of state and private 
representatives is needed to find ways of providing health insurance coverage 
to all Californians. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Peter von Elten: No. Suggests that the state might regulate insurance industry 
profits on medical coverage, hand out stiffer penalties to physicians caught 
double-billing and more closely monitor the use of medical tests and X-rays. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
What is your position on offshore oil drilling? 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Seymour (Sy) Alban: Opposes all new offshore oil drilling, except in a national 
emergency. Would require oil tankers to be double-hulled and supports creating 
an oil spill fund financed with a per-barrel tax on oil. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Jan Hall: "I've seen areas where it works (such as Long Beach), but I think 
there are areas that are very fragile -- and I would state categorically that 
Huntington Beach is one of them -- and it's totally inappropriate and shouldn't 
be pursued." Supports double-hulling of tankers and a spill fund financed by 
the oil and shipping industry. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Jeffrey Kellogg: Says the decision of whether to drill offshore should be made 
"case by case." Would prohibit drilling in environmentally sensitive areas, 
such as near wetlands. Opposes creating an industry-financed oil spill fund, 
supports double-hulling of some smaller tankers and would support requiring oil 
companies to post bonds when drilling. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Thomas J. Mays: Opposes offshore oil drilling along the entire California 
coast, says tankers should be required to come into port rather than use 
offshore moorings to unload, supports double-hulling. Does not object to a 
spill fund but says, "I think it should be done at the federal level." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Peter von Elten: Opposes new oil drilling off the California coast, supports 
creating an industry-financed spill fund and double-hulling requirements. 
</P>
<P>

Jan Hall: Yes. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Jeffrey Kellogg: Yes. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Thomas J. Mays: No. "Everybody is guaranteed the same rights under the 
Constitution," he said. "I don't feel special-interest legislation is the right 
way to go." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Peter von Elten: Yes. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Do you support Proposition 115, an initiative that would amend the California 
Constitution to speed trial proceedings and set broad new limits on the rights 
of criminal defendants? 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Seymour (Sy) Alban: Yes. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
