Wataru Tanaka, a science fiction writer and self-described "aerospace 
exploration commentator," nearly became the first Japanese to venture into 
space. He hatched an outrageous plan four years ago to bring home a surplus 
American rocket and blast himself into orbit. 
</P>
<P>
But Tanaka, 58, whose credits include a book titled "The Taste of Lettuce Eaten 
In Space," gave up his dream after running into a wall of red tape. He counted 
26 laws and regulations administered by six government agencies that made his 
extraterrestrial mission all but impossible. 
</P>
<P>
Tanaka's countrymen are not far behind, though. After decades of quiet, modest 
research and development that attracted scant notice from abroad, Japan's 
official -- and unofficial -- space programs are now reaching critical mass. 
The effort could open yet another field where Japanese technological prowess 
translates into an economic challenge. 
</P>
<P>
Already, Japan has become the third country, after the United States and the 
Soviet Union, to take aim at the moon. 
</P>
<P>
On Jan. 24, a small scientific research institute run on a shoestring budget by 
the Education Ministry launched "Muses-A," a lunar orbiter that, if successful, 
next month will become the first object from Earth to approach the moon since 
the Soviets sent up an unmanned probe in 1976. 
</P>
<P>
And in a peculiar drama that gives a new meaning to the "space race," Japanese 
government astronauts and private cosmonauts are competing to see who will be 
the first to take a Rising Sun flag to the heavens. 
</P>
<P>
Japan's primary space agency, the National Space Development Agency or NASDA, 
is training two men and a woman to serve as payload specialists on the U.S. 
space shuttle Atlantis in a flight scheduled for June, 1991. 
</P>
<P>
At the same time, a commercial television network, Tokyo Broadcasting System, 
has paid a hefty sum, reportedly $10 million, to Moscow for the privilege of 
sending one of its journalists aboard the Soviet space station Mir in a mission 
that could come as early as the end of this year. 
</P>
<P>
NASDA, meanwhile, is joining the European and Canadian space agencies in 
cooperative development of the U.S. space station Freedom. Japan is building a 
$2-billion laboratory module for the space station, which is expected to start 
orbiting the Earth in 1998. 
</P>
<P>
On the immediate horizon, the Japanese are focusing their efforts on commercial 
satellite launchings and other practical applications, such as last Wednesday's 
launch of a marine observation satellite by NASDA. 
</P>
<P>
But they also have long-range plans to send astronauts aloft in their own space 
shuttle. The government's Space Activities Commission proposed last June that 
Japan try launching its own space station by the year 2010. One of the 
country's major construction companies is designing a "space hotel," while 
another envisions a lunar resort offering "zero-gravity games" to shuttle-loads 
of Japanese tourists. 
</P>
<P>
"This is the destiny of the human race," said Akira Kubozono, executive 
director of NASDA. "We Japanese have decided we must pursue manned space 
development. It's a dream, a romance. And if new technologies spin off in the 
process, we can always benefit by spreading them through industry." 
</P>
<P>
This bold vision of space development and the commercialization of related 
technologies may seem laughable given Japan's meager space budget. In the 
current fiscal year, Japan is spending about $1.1 billion on space, or less 
than a tenth of the U.S. National Aeronautics and Space Administration's 
$12.3-billion budget. NASDA has 950 employees, as opposed to about 22,000 
working for NASA. 
</P>
<P>
But as the Muses-A moon mission demonstrates, impressive results sometimes can 
be achieved without astronomical spending. The scientific organization that 
launched the lunar orbiter, the Institute of Space and Astronautical Science 
(ISAS), grew out of a low-key research laboratory at Tokyo University that 
pioneered Japan's efforts to escape gravity in 1955 by launching 9-inch-long 
"pencil rockets." 
</P>
<P>
(A replica of the first Japanese pencil rocket is on display at the National 
Air and Space Museum of the Smithsonian Institution in Washington.) 
</P>
<P>
ISAS, which now has a full-time staff of 105 and operates on a budget of about 
$145 million a year, has launched 19 satellites since 1970 with essentially 
home-grown technology. It made its first interplanetary voyage in 1985 and sent 
two satellites to rendezvous with Halley's comet the following year. Muses-A is 
designed to test the "swing-by" technique, by which the moon's gravitational 
pull will be used to catapult a second, tiny satellite into lunar orbit 
sometime around March 18. 
</P>
<P>
"After we finish with the moon in the 1990s, we may be ready to take on Mars," 
said Yasunori Matokawa, an ISAS official. 
</P>
<P>
Tanaka, the writer and failed free-lance astronaut, predicts that it is only a 
matter of time before space fantasies start becoming reality here. When a 
Japanese finally flies in space, he said, the media hoopla can be expected to 
spark a boom in public interest and mobilize vast resources. 
</P>
<P>
"Once Japanese see something with their own eyes, they can understand it," said 
Tanaka, who also operates a space cafe in Tokyo called "Restaurant Goddard," 
after the U.S. rocket scientist Robert H. Goddard, who pioneered liquid fuel 
engines. 
</P>
<P>
"We're not good at imagining things we can't see, and at this point space 
exploration is entirely abstract," Tanaka said. "But when the time comes, you 
can count on the Japanese to jump out in front." 
</P>
<P>
Indeed, early signs of space fever are already starting to appear. In April, 
Nippon Steel Corp. plans to open "Space World," a so-called "edu-tainment" 
theme park on the site of its shut-down plant in Yawata, in southwestern Japan. 
</P>
<P>
Under the banner of diversification, the world's largest steelmaker will also 
run a space camp at the park, modeled after and licensed by the original one in 
Huntsville, Ala. 
</P>
<P>
Otsuka Pharmaceutical Co. is marketing "space food" through the health food 
section of a major department store chain, and Uni-Charm Corp., a leading maker 
of sanitary napkins and disposable diapers, is now designing products for space 
travel. Both these companies, along with Sony and Minolta, have lined up as 
commercial sponsors for the Tokyo Broadcasting System's six-day ride aboard the 
Mir space station. 
</P>
<P>
Toshio Nakanishi, a network spokesman, said the extravaganza was initially 
planned as a stunt to celebrate the commercial broadcaster's 40th anniversary 
next year, but it quickly took on a deeper meaning. 
</P>
<P>
"We thought it was necessary now for a Japanese to go to space," Nakanishi 
said. "So far, a total of about 200 people from 20 countries have been in 
space, but not a single Japanese. We're way behind, compared to the economic 
power we possess." 
</P>
<P>
The network plans to broadcast daily 10-minute live television spots from 
orbit. 
</P>
<P>
Author Tanaka is disturbed by the thought that a television journalist aboard a 
Soviet craft may be first Japanese in space, before one of NASDA's 
professionals rides on a friendly American space shuttle. (The original plan to 
have a Japanese payload specialist fly on the U.S. space shuttle two years ago 
was delayed by the Jan. 27, 1986, Challenger explosion.) 
</P>
<P>
"It's going to be a problem from a historic point of view if the first Japanese 
in space rides with the Soviets," he said. "This is a highly symbolic matter. 
The United States is our closest ally. We owe our postwar economic prosperity 
to America. I don't know where this idea comes from that you can buy whatever 
you want with money. We Japanese didn't used to think like this." 
</P>
<P>
NASDA's Kubozono was somewhat more philosophical about the network's deal with 
the Soviets. 
</P>
<P>
"There's a lot of room in space," Kubozono said. "They're making considerable 
noise about who's going to be first, but our aims are completely different. 
We're in this for science, not publicity. We may have feelings about it in our 
hearts, but we don't need to say anything out loud." 
</P>
<P>
Adding to the confusion over who might actually be blazing the trail for 
Japanese space exploration is the subtle bureaucratic rivalry between NASDA, 
part of the Science and Technology Agency, and ISAS, part of the Education 
Ministry. 
</P>
<P>
NASDA is the younger of the two agencies, created in 1969 to pursue practical 
applications in space, and it receives the lion's share of the space budget. 
ISAS is ostensibly confined to scientific research -- Parliament even sets a 
limit on the diameter of the rockets it may build and launch, which was only 
recently expanded to 8 feet 3 inches. 
</P>
<P>
Yet the division of labor is sometimes blurred. Both agencies are working on 
separate projects to develop an unmanned space plane, for example. And the fact 
that ISAS invented its own rocketry while NASDA imported technology from the 
United States, in a crash catch-up program, appears to be a lingering sore 
point for the latter agency. NASDA did not launch its first satellite until 
1975, five years after ISAS. 
</P>
<P>
Now, NASDA is exhibiting a stubborn pride -- and commercial interest -- in 
sticking to purely Japanese technology in developing the next generation of the 
H-II rocket, a two-stage, 108-foot-tall launch vehicle capable of carrying a 
two-ton payload. 
</P>
<P>
NASDA's earlier efforts were based on McDonnell Douglas Astronautics Co.'s 
Delta rocket, and although its current workhorse rocket, the costly H-I, is 
about 80% Japanese, key components such as the first-stage engine rely on 
imported technology. The compulsion to go it alone has resulted in some serious 
problems and delays in the H-II development, however. 
</P>
<P>
Twice last year, the H-II's first-stage engine, the LE-7, caught fire during 
tests at NASDA's launch center on Tanega Shima, an island off Kagoshima in 
southwestern Japan. The problem, related to regulating the flow of liquid 
hydrogen into the combustion chamber, has already delayed completion of the 
H-II by one year, to 1993. 
</P>
<P>
Although the engine is similar to those used on U.S. space shuttles, Tomifumi 
Godai, NASDA's chief of launch vehicle development, dismissed the idea of 
turning to the Americans for help, saying Japanese engineers would be able to 
solve the problem by themselves. Godai also insisted that the new rocket would 
be a cost-effective launch vehicle, capable of carrying satellites aloft at 
internationally competitive prices. 
</P>
<P>
Keeping the H-II development limited to 100% domestic know-how is a crucial 
challenge because a bilateral agreement with the United States currently gives 
Washington veto power over the launching of third-country satellites when U.S. 
technology is involved. 
</P>
<P>
At stake is the potentially lucrative market for commercial satellite 
launching, which Arianespace, the European consortium, now dominates. But even 
if NASDA overcomes its H-II engine troubles, other barriers to competitiveness 
remain, not the least of which is an agreement with local fishermen limiting 
launch schedules to two 45-day windows, one in summer and one in winter. Noise 
from the rockets supposedly scares away the tuna. 
</P>
<P>
Still, Americans who recall dismissing those first imported fleets of homely 
Japanese cars in the 1960s might think twice before laughing away Japanese 
ambitions in space. Japan went on to out-finesse the U.S. auto industry, it may 
be recalled, after starting very small. 
</P>
<P>
And a familiar name is on the cutting edge of Japan's space technology: 
Mitsubishi Heavy Industries Ltd., the company that built the Zero fighter 50 
years ago and more recently lobbied unsuccessfully to go it alone designing 
Japan's next generation jet fighter, the FSX. 
</P>
<P>
A co-development agreement to license technology from the U.S. front-line 
fighter, the F-16, to Mitsubishi Heavy for the FSX was nearly scuttled in a 
last-minute attack by critics in Washington last year. Opponents argued that 
the deal handed over key technology that Japan could later use to compete 
against the United States in the aerospace and commercial airliner industry. 
</P>
<P>
A residue of mutual suspicion left by the FSX dispute, coupled with unresolved 
U.S. frustrations over a contentious trade complaint about American commercial 
satellites sales to Japanese government agencies, perhaps colors the atmosphere 
in cooperative space development. 
</P>
<P>
According to news reports, Kubozono expressed irritation over delays in the 
Freedom space station program when he visited Washington recently. In general, 
the Japanese appear to be growing wary of relying on the United States and its 
vastly superior experience in space. 
</P>
<P>
"You can't depend on another country. If you don't have advanced technology of 
your own, it's impossible to truly participate in international cooperation," 
said Matokawa of ISAS. "From now on, I suppose we'll go on relying on NASA; at 
the same time we'll have to develop our own independent capabilities." 
</P>
