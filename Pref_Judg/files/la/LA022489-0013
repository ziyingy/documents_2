Aco-star of the television series "Fame" pleaded no contest Thursday to drunken 
driving in connection with a December accident in which he crashed into a car 
head-on and injured a Studio City man and his two young sons. 
</P>
<P>
Under a plea agreement with prosecutors, Kenneth C. Swofford, 55, who plays the 
principal in the show, could be sentenced June 13 to a maximum of four years in 
state prison for the accident that left George Charouhas, 37, disabled with a 
spine injury, said Deputy Dist. Atty. Michael Pargament.

Paul Charouhas, 11, suffered skull fractures and his brother, Stephen, 6, 
suffered a broken leg, Pargament said.

The crash occurred about 7 p.m. Dec. 17 at Ventura Boulevard and Eureka Avenue 
in Studio City. According to police reports, Swofford swerved over the double 
yellow line and hit Charouhas' car head-on.

<P>
Swofford, who suffered facial cuts, had a blood-alcohol level of 0.18%, 
Pargament said. The legal limit under California law is 0.10%. 
</P>
<P>
Swofford, of Woodland Hills, had no prior history of arrests or convictions, 
Pargament said. But he said he believed that a prison sentence is appropriate.

"He's got an absolutely clean record," the prosecutor said. "He's a solid, 
middle-class, pillar-of-the-community type. Nonetheless I have a young man in 
his late 30s who's now got a life-crippling ailment. I don't know if he'll ever 
recover from his spine injury. The level of injuries in this case lead me to 
believe that this ought to be a state prison sentence."

Swofford would not comment on the case when reached by telephone Thursday at 
his home.
