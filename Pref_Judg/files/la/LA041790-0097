African National Congress leader Nelson R. Mandela on Monday declared to a 
potential worldwide television audience of 1 billion that apartheid in South 
Africa will be ended only by "struggle," including international sanctions. 
</P>
<P>
Speaking from the stage of a sellout concert before 72,000 people at London's 
Wembley Stadium to celebrate his freedom, he told television viewers in 60 
countries: "Reject any suggestion that the campaign to isolate the apartheid 
system should be wound down." 
</P>
<P>
But expressing surprising optimism at the pace of reforms, he predicted: "It 
will not be long now before we see an end to the apartheid system. The dreams 
of millions of people to see our country free and at peace will be realized 
sooner rather than later." 
</P>
<P>
Calling for the transformation of South Africa from being "the skunk of the 
Earth" to an "exemplary oasis" of democracy, good race relations and freedom 
from poverty and human degradation, he said: "It will be a proud day for 
humanity when we are able to say that the apartheid crime against humanity is 
no more." 
</P>
<P>
He reminded his audience that there are still political prisoners in South 
African custody, saying: "We should, therefore, treat this day of celebration 
as one of re-dedication to the continuation and intensification of the struggle 
for the emancipation of all the remaining political prisoners." 
</P>
<P>
The program was not televised in the United States, where it was deemed too 
political, or in South Africa. 
</P>
<P>
In a thinly veiled attack on British Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher, who 
eased sanctions on South Africa earlier this year in response to political 
reforms there, Mandela said: 
</P>
<P>
"It is only those who support apartheid who can argue that the Pretoria 
government should be rewarded for the small steps it has taken, such as our 
release, and the unbanning of the ANC and the other organizations." 
</P>
<P>
Thatcher lifted a ban on new British investments, without waiting for the 
approval of her partners in the 12-member European Community. 
</P>
<P>
Before arriving here, Mandela called the British policy "absolutely disastrous" 
and spurned an open invitation to meet the prime minister during his two days 
in London. 
</P>
<P>
The concert was staged to celebrate Mandela's release in February from 27 years 
in prison. 
</P>
<P>
Among the entertainers were Bonnie Raitt, Neil Young, Simple Minds, Soul II 
Soul, the Neville Brothers, Peter Gabriel, Anita Baker, Tracy Chapman, Jackson 
Browne, Johnny Clegg and actor Denzel Washington. 
</P>
<P>
In his speech, Mandela said: "The transformation of our country into a 
non-racial democracy . . . will only become reality as a result of struggle, 
including the struggle represented by the international sanctions campaign. . . 
. The apartheid crime against humanity remains in place. It continues to kill 
and maim. It continues to oppress and exploit. . . . 
</P>
<P>
"All of us must, therefore, refuse to be demobilized, even if those who seek to 
demobilize us plead that they are doing so out of a new-found concern for the 
oppressed and out of the goodness of their hearts."
