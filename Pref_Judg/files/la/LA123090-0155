A 13-year-old girl was fatally shot through her family's South Los Angeles 
living room window early Saturday as she watched television, a special occasion 
in which her normally strict mother had allowed her to stay up late because a 
friend was spending the night. 
</P>

Tanya Cadle was rendered brain dead by a single shot to her head and died hours 
later at Cedars-Sinai Medical Center after her parents had her disconnected 
from life-support systems, a hospital spokesman said. There were no other 
injuries. 
</P>
<P>
"I didn't hear the shots, I just heard my son shouting, 'Get down! Get down!' " 
said Tanya's mother, Eleanor Cadle, a devout Seventh-day Adventist. "Then we 
came out here and found (Tanya's girlfriend) on the floor and my daughter on 
the sofa." 
</P>
<P>
Los Angeles police described the crime in the 3000 block of South Hillcrest 
Drive as an apparent drive-by shooting. They had made no arrests Saturday. 
</P>
<P>
Eleanor Cadle, a security officer at USC, said that she and her husband, Dean, 
a chemical technician for a wheel manufacturer, had no idea what led to the 
shooting but that they resented early news reports implying that the crime was 
gang related. "No one here is affiliated with the gangs and we have nothing to 
retaliate about," she said firmly, as friends and fellow church members crowded 
her small home. 
</P>
<P>
The family, originally from Belize, moved to the quiet street of 
well-maintained bungalows about two months ago in the belief that it was a step 
up from their home on South Catalina Street. 
</P>
<P>
"I was looking for something better and it's better than where I was," Eleanor 
Cadle said. 
</P>
<P>
The incident was one of a number of shootings that took place over the weekend, 
including a 13-year-old who was shot to death in Pomona while he slept. 
</P>
<P>
At the Cadle home in the Crenshaw district of Los Angeles, grim family friends 
shook their heads in disbelief and anger as they took in the enormity of the 
violence. Bloodstains were visible on the brown sofa where Tanya had been 
watching television, across from a brightly lit Christmas tree. Lace and 
peach-colored curtains adorned the bullet-shatterred window and a well-thumbed 
Bible was on the coffee table. 
</P>
<P>
Tanya was a B student at Forshay Junior High School and had just returned from 
a church youth meeting when she asked to stay up late watching a video, her 
mother said.

"They are a very nice family and they try to bring their kids up as best they 
can," said Clarine Davis, a friend. "It's a respectable family -- that's why it 
hurt so much when they said it was related to gangs. 
</P>
<P>
"We don't understand. We're just baffled. We try to do things with our kids to 
keep them off the streets; we're family people. You get to the point where you 
feel like you're doing the best you can, and then the kids aren't even safe 
when they are home."
