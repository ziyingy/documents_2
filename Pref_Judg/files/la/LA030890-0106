Britain, under pressure from neighboring countries to improve its pollution 
practices, agreed to join other North Sea nations in steps to clean up the sea. 
Britain, the only nation bordering the North Sea that still dumps sewage sludge 
and industrial wastes into the sea, agreed with other nations at a conference 
in The Hague, Netherlands, to reduce by 70% from 1985 levels the amount of 
cadmium, mercury, dioxin and lead it dumps into the sea by 1995.
