The Next New World by Bob Shacochis (Crown: $16.95; 209 pages) 
</P>
<P>
There is a difference between what a writer chooses to write and what he or she 
cannot help but write. Even with a gifted writer, the difference shows. 
</P>
<P>
Bob Shacochis, who won a National Book Award three years ago for "Easy in the 
Islands," has come out with a new collection of short stories. A divide seems 
to run down it, marking off two very unequal parts. 
</P>
<P>
Six of the stories, possessing various degrees of imagination and gracefulness, 
seem, nonetheless, to be almost exercises in a variety of genres, voices and 
locales. The seventh, "Celebrations of the New World," all but burns on the 
page, clamoring to be heard. 
</P>
<P>
Two of the six deal with old people so near death that they inhabit a kind of 
ghost-ridden border territory. In "Les Femmes Creoles," two ancient sisters on 
a derelict Caribbean plantation lie in bed and receive, imagining them to be 
lovers, a vagrant soldier from a colonial occupying force, and a black 
guerrilla. 
</P>
<P>
In "Where Pelham Fell," a retired army officer in his 80s drives perilously 
about the Virginia countryside, accompanied by ghostly detachments of the 
Confederate Army. A farmer gives him two sacks of bones; the old colonel tries 
to put them together in his shed, while his wife dozes inside the house. Dying, 
the colonel hears the bones rattle, summoning him to lead them.

A Contrived Air to Them 
</P>
<P>
The quality of this pair is as delicate and haunting as their subject, yet they 
have a contrived air to them. The haunting is an effect achieved, not grown. 
</P>
<P>
Two other stories depict men late in middle-age, with illusions at sunset, and 
delusions not yet at moonrise. The caretaker in "Stolen Kiss" has fantasies 
about the woman who spends summers in one of the beach houses he looks after. 
He finds a lip-mark imprinted on a post of her porch; he kisses it and paints 
it over. 
</P>
<P>
In "Picture of the Week," a former beatnik whose companion has just died of 
cancer sells the Caribbean property they had settled in, and prepares to return 
north, "to enter, like the millions before him in these times, the draft of 
cooling current." Both stories provide recipes for a kind of bitter-sweet jolt, 
but not the jolt itself. 
</P>
<P>
Another pair of stories -- one about a Galveston harmonica player who loses his 
girlfriend in grisly fashion, the second about a Cape Hatteras waterman who is 
identified as a Nazi war criminal after catching a record-size fish -- are 
melodramatic and flat. A pastiche about Shakespeare playing Hamlet's father's 
ghost is flatter still. 
</P>
<P>
"Celebrations" stands in shining and welcome contrast. Its setting is the 
meeting of two disastrously different families, a year or two after the son of 
one family and the daughter of the other have married. 
</P>
<P>
The husband's family -- he is the narrator -- are well-to-do Midwesterners who 
arrive for the reunion in a small flotilla of station wagons, campers and 
Cadillacs. "They are clean and slow, responsible and readily impressed," the 
narrator says of his family. 
</P>
<P>
The wife's family, which lives in Philadelphia where the reunion takes place, 
is Lebanese-American. The dinner is cross-cultural comedy; the visitors nibble 
fearfully at the platters of tabbouleh and skewered meat. Gloria, the 
Midwestern mother, tries to civilize things by placing tiny marshmallows stuck 
with American Flags on each plate. 
</P>
<P>
But the ethnic chaos is only background. Bernie, the host, is a retired 
professor who is developing Alzheimer's disease; he flickers tragically between 
awareness and absence. Rosie, his decisive and energetic wife, is nearing a 
decision to commit him to a nursing home. The dinner puts Bernie and his 
condition on display for their daughter, Lorraine, and her husband, the latter 
reflects, so that they will be able to reassure Rosie: "Yes, you're doing the 
right thing." 
</P>
<P>
The transaction is treated acutely but with tenderness. The entire story, in 
fact, is both unsparing and compassionate. Comedy and awfulness jostle each 
other, particularly when Bernie's brother, Joachim, flies in from Mexico and 
turns out to be as unstable as the host. 
</P>
<P>
The two old men flare up, wander, return, and generally exacerbate the 
dinner-table disaster. In between storms, they hold hands and tell stories 
about their childhood. And at the end, the addled pair retreats into a closet 
to smoke cigars. The narrator joins them, and after awhile, so does Lorraine 
and the baby she's nursing. 
</P>
<P>
It's absurd, and entirely right. Life designs closets to help us bear what we 
can't bear. I suspect that Shacochis' closet will open onto a future novel.
