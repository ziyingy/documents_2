Here are some facts and figures about Antarctica.

 History: Britain's Capt. James Cook is believed to have first entered 
Antarctic waters during an expedition from 1773 to 1775, and was followed by 
several other mariners who discovered land there in the early 1800s. The 
American Capt. Charles Wilkes first identified it as a continent in 1840, when 
he traced 1,500 miles of coastline. The first inland expeditions were carried 
out by Norway's Leonard Kristensen and Britain's Robert F. Scott and Ernest 
Shackleton in the late 1800s and early 1900s. Roald Amundsen of Norway reached 
the South Pole in December, 1911, and Scott arrived a month later, but his 
four-man party perished.

Geography: Antarctica has an area of 5.1 million square miles, larger than 
Europe's, and has been determined to have 17,500 miles of rugged coastline. Its 
uneven surface of rock and gravel descends toward the center like a soup bowl, 
under the vast weight of a rounded cap of ice more than a mile deep in some 
places. The total volume of ice on the continent is equivalent to 72% of all 
the water on earth. The continent is divided by the Transantarctic Mountains 
and includes other clusters of peaks, including Visson Massif, the highest at 
16,864 feet above sea level.

Climate: Antarctica's inland temperatures remain almost constantly below 
freezing, making it the coldest continent. On the Antarctic Peninsula, 
temperatures can rise above freezing during the austral summer. The lowest 
reading ever, at the Soviet Union's Vostok Station on July 21, 1983, was minus 
89.2 degrees Celsius. There is little precipitation in Antarctica, an average 
of 4 inches a year.

Politics: The continent is administered by the Antarctic Treaty, signed by 12 
nations in 1961. The signers agreed to suspend territorial claims and dedicate 
the region to peaceful research. Eight other nations have since become voting 
members, and 18 more have observer status. The treaty is up for review in 1991. 
Seven nations make direct territorial claims to parts of the continent, with 
some claims overlapping. Other countries, including the United States and the 
Soviet Union, refuse to recognize any claims.
