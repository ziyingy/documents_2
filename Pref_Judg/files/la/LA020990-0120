Like tractors tilling a vast field, a pair of skimmer boats plowing through the 
subdued waters off Huntington Beach on Thursday represented what officials 
believed was the best hope of conquering the American Trader oil spill. 
</P>
<P>
But the boats were painfully slow, moving at only about 2 m.p.h. with their oil 
suction booms deployed. And their oil collection capacity was limited to about 
1,200 barrels. They appeared as specks amid the miles-long spill from the 
breached oil tanker. 
</P>
<P>
The two large skimmer vessels, converted from crew boats that serve offshore 
oil drilling platforms, were being supplemented by two smaller skimmers. In 
addition, the Coast Guard reported that three other private oil skimming 
vessels and 15 Navy skimmers were en route. 
</P>
<P>
The boats formed the main vanguard in the war to fight the oil spill. The 
troops -- about 400 shovel-armed beach cleaners -- were awaiting their call. 
</P>
<P>
"Right here in this area we have some of the biggest assets . . . and cleanup 
effort equipment in the world," said Adm. Paul Yost, the Coast Guard's 
commandant. "I've never seen an oil spill where you have this kind of response 
in less than 24 hours." 
</P>
<P>
Nature also was aiding in the effort. Mild weather and seas aided the sea 
skimmers, and the Coast Guard estimated that 30% of the oil would simply 
evaporate. 
</P>
<P>
To a large extent, the Coast Guard sat back and watched the action. Coast Guard 
officials said that while they were deeply involved in monitoring and strategy, 
they would only take charge if the oil company efforts prove inadequate. 
</P>
<P>
Just what is considered adequate appeared to depend largely on the available 
resources. Some observers, such as city officials in Long Beach, said they 
believe there isn't enough cleanup equipment available to handle a major spill. 
</P>
<P>
"We decided if we had to handle a disaster the size of the (Exxon) Valdez, it 
couldn't be done with the amount of equipment on hand," said Long Beach 
Assistant City Manager John Shirey, who took part in city hearings on the issue 
last year. 
</P>
<P>
The initial response to Wednesday's spill came within moments but fell woefully 
short, some officials said. A boat that routinely accompanies tankers to their 
moorings off Huntington Beach tried to boom off the ship, but Coast Guard 
officials said it did not have enough floating plastic skirt to encircle the 
American Trader and a trail of oil escaped into the ocean. 
</P>
<P>
In about an hour after notification, the first cleanup boats of Clean Coastal 
Waters, a Long Beach-based oil spill service funded by major oil companies, 
arrived and started booming and skimming. 
</P>
<P>
At daybreak Thursday, a pair of oil-skimming vessels were trawling about five 
miles offshore. They had booms draped over either side that could hold the 
suction equipment. At their peak efficiency, they can each cut a 125-foot swath 
through the oil-covered sea, said Patrick Martin, a Clean Coastal Waters 
spokesman. 
</P>
<P>
While their oil storage capacity is limited, they can dump their loads into 
barges so they can stay on station. Besides Clean Coastal Waters, the Clean 
Seas cooperative in Santa Barbara was dispatching skimmer ships. 
</P>
<P>
In addition, a smaller, twin-hulled skimmer boat and a team of beach cleaners 
from the private Chempro Environmental Services was hired. General Manager Guy 
Bubica said 60 or 70 workers were waiting for oil to wash up on the beaches. 
Another 300 or more could be pressed into service if needed, he said. 
</P>
<P>
Bubica added that the company had so much boom awaiting use that it was still 
stacked in the company's storage yard.
