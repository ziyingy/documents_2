In a move to modify its vast reorganization in 1989, McDonnell Douglas has 
named John P. Capellupo deputy president of its Douglas Aircraft unit in Long 
Beach.

Capellupo, a veteran of McDonnell's operations in St. Louis for more than 30 
years, will begin in the newly created position Monday.

Douglas Aircraft underwent a tumultuous reorganization last year, in which all 
of the 5,200 members of management were forced to apply for new jobs. The 
previous eight layers of management were trimmed to five.

Company spokesman Don Hanson denied that the addition of Capellupo will add a 
layer of management, since he will work "side-by-side" with Douglas President 
Robert H. Hood Jr. All executives reporting to Hood will also report to 
Capellupo.

Meanwhile, Hanson said Douglas delivered 118 MD-80 jetliners in 1989, somewhat 
shy of the goal of 123 aircraft set by Hood last summer. Employees on the 
flight ramp, where aircraft are delivered, worked around the clock over the 
holidays in an effort to get as many aircraft as possible delivered.

The company also failed to fly the MD-11 jetliner by year-end, despite a big 
drive to do so last week. At one point, the company hoped to fly the aircraft 
last Thursday. Hood set a goal last summer of having three of the test aircraft 
flying by year-end. RALPH VARTABEDIAN
