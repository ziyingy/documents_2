When Jacques Andreani, ambassador of France to the United States, arrived in 
Los Angeles, he and his wife Donatella buzzed to Orange County. They wanted to 
visit Orange High School, where she was an American Field Service exchange 
student in 1962. 
</P>
<P>
This week, the couple (she in Dior black and white polka dots with a clump of 
the Dior emblematic lily of the valley flowers on her shoulder) attended the 
party French Consul Gen. Gerard Coste and his wife, Naomi, gave in their 
Beverly Hills home. 
</P>
<P>
Earlier the ambassador had addressed the Los Angeles World Affairs Council, and 
later the couple was feted at a sit-down dinner hosted by Howard Ruby. 
Prominent at the consular residence were Dr. Franklin and Judith Murphy, Los 
Angeles Area Chamber of Commerce President Ray Remy, Los Angeles County Museum 
of Art Director Rusty Powell, author Annie Cohen-Solal (head of French Cultural 
Services in the United States), Marcia Weisman and Elin Vanderlip, wearing her 
Commandeur des Arts and Lettres, and en route to the Soviet Union.

STAR: World-renowned paleoanthropologist Richard E. Leakey, new director of the 
Kenya Wildlife Services, was in demand last week. The Greater Los Angeles Zoo 
Assn. brought him to town to speak on the rapid decline of Kenyan elephants (a 
drop of 140,000 in 1970 to 20,000 now, says Leakey) and rhinos at a Century 
Towers dinner. 
</P>
<P>
Leakey became controversial last July when he made the dramatic decision to 
torch 13 tons of elephant tusks his department had confiscated in order to 
promote a ban on ivory. The zoo affair was a benefit for its endangered species 
fund. 
</P>
<P>
The evening before, Bob and Donna Tuttle and their friends -- Brad Freeman, 
Bill and Tallie Mingst, Joe and Sally Keon, Bill and Nadine Tilley, and Richard 
and Beth Rogers -- invited a coterie to meet Leakey at their new home in 
Beverly Hills. 
</P>
<P>
The evening was also a polite invitation to write checks directly to Leakey, 
who is traveling worldwide to raise millions to hire rangers and equip them 
with automatic rifles, helicopters and aircraft to eliminate poachers and 
protect parks. 
</P>
<P>
Among the listeners: Stuart and Carrie Ketchum, Virginia and Mary Milner, Alec 
and Jocelyn Wildenstein, Kathleen and Tom McCarthy, and Tam and Donald 
Dickerson. Leakey told them he hopes to borrow $250 million from the World Bank 
and other financial institutions, and is promising 25% will go to rural 
development to improve schools, housing and roads.
