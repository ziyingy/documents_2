  [Text] Laos, Myanmar [Burma], and Thailand called on the 
international community to render sponsorship and technical and 
financial assistance and cooperation to fight narcotics 
problems. The appeal was contained in the joint declaration 
issued at the second ministerial-level meeting on cooperation on 
the control of drug abuse between Laos, Myanmar, and Thailand 
which concluded on Wednesday. 
  The joint declaration said: The three nations are deeply 
concerned with the unprecedented and alarming spread of narcotic 
drug abuse in all regions of the world, thus causing long-term 
adverse effects on the users themselves as well as on their 
families. 
  The three sides unanimously agreed that coordination is 
needed at three levels -- national, regional, and sub-regional. 
The three countries agreed that the ministerial-level meeting 
on cooperation on controlling drug abuse should be held every 
two years to review progress of cooperation and to map out 
future cooperation plans. Senior officials on drug control from 
these countries will hold a meeting at least once a year to 
consult about the trends of drug use and trafficking as well as 
measures to suppress this problem. 
  The next ministerial-level meeting of the three countries 
will be held in Laos in 1996.
