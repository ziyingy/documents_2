  [Text] Frantisek Dlhopolcek, director of the Foreign 
Ministry's bilateral contacts department, received the director 
of Radio Free Europe [RFE] Robert Gillette at Gillette's 
request. Robert Gillette briefed Dlhopolcek on the situation 
that has developed as a result of the decision made by Roman 
Hofbauer, minister of transport, communications, and public 
works, concerning the termination of the agreement between the 
former Federal Ministry of Communications and Radio Free Europe. 
During the discussion Frantisek Dlhopolcek said that under the 
totalitarian regime the RFE was a symbol for the Eastern bloc 
states and one of the few sources of free information available 
to citizens living in these countries. But the situation has 
changed since 1989 and that is why we need to seek new forms of 
addressing the listeners. RFE broadcasting should adapt to 
this, too.
