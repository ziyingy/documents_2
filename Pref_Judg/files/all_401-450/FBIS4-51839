  [Text] Tokyo, May 4 KYODO -- Japan's young population 
declined further to total 20.59 million children under the age 
of 15 as of April 1, down 500,000 from a year ago, the 
Management and Coordination Agency said Wednesday [4 May], a day 
before Children's Day. As of April 1 this year, children 
accounted for 16.5 percent of the nation's 125 million 
population, down 0.4 percentage points from the previous year, 
the agency said. 
  Since 1975, Japan has witnessed a steady decline in its 
population of children, a trend often referred to as Japan's 
aging society. 
  The largest portion of the nation's children, some 1.62 
million, are already teenagers aged 14. Reflecting the 
declining birth rate over the last decade, the younger the 
child, the fewer peers in his age group. 
  About 1.2 million children belong to each age group between 
1 
and 4. Children under 1 year old numbered 1.19 million. 
  Okinawa Prefecture was Japan's "youngest" prefecture with 
more than one in five persons, or 22.8 percent, under 15, 
according to statistics as of October 1, 1993. Following were 
Saga Prefecture and Miyazaki Prefecture with 18.9 percent each. 
  In contrast, Tokyo with more than 11 million inhabitants had 
the lowest share of children with some 13.9 percent. A slightly 
higher percentage of young people were living in Toyama 
prefecture, with 15.8 percent, and Kanagawa Prefecture, with 
15.9 percent. 
  In all 47 prefectures, the share of children was lower than 
the previous year. 
  Compared with other aging industrialized nations, Japan came 
third after Italy and Germany, where children under 15 accounted 
for 16.3 percent of the national populations, based on 1991 and 
1992 surveys, respectively.
