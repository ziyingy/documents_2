  [Text] Harbin, March 16 (XINHUA) -- A new kind of 
intelligent robot which is able to climb vertical walls to 
examine storage tanks of dangerous materials has been created. 
  The remote-controlled robot, developed mainly by researchers 
at the Harbin Engineering University in Heilongjiang Province, 
is the first of its kind in China. 
  It can adhere to the surface of storage tanks holding 
radioactive materials to check their brazing seams and the 
thickness of the tank walls. It can also carry out safety 
examinations, rust ridding and lacquer spraying for various 
containers in the chemical industry, and clean-up work on 
skyscrapers. 
  The machine consists of six parts: a robot transporter, the 
robot itself, highly flexible mechanical arms, a control system, 
a visual system and an ultrasonic detection system.
