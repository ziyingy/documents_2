  [Text] Seoul, March 1 (YONHAP) -- The South Korean 
Government sent an application to United Nations 
Secretary-General Butrus Butrus-Ghali Monday to join the Basel 
Convention, which controls trans-boundary movements and disposal 
of hazardous waste. 
  South Korea will be regulated by the Convention from May 29, 
90 days after it sent the application, the Foreign Ministry said. 
  Under the Convention, signatories cannot trade waste matters 
with nonparticipants. If they want to export waste, they should 
receive written approval first from the country which imports 
the waste. 
  The Basel Convention specifies the kinds of waste matters to 
be controlled, and sets procedure of trans-boundary movements of 
the waste and ways to make a final disposal of the wastes in 
order to protect human health and environment. 
  As of now, 52 countries joined the Convention.
