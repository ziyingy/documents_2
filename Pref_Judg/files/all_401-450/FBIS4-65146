  [Excerpt] Butrus Butrus-Ghali has left South Africa for 
Paris. He was received [in France] today by the French prime 
minister and by President Mitterrand. He took advantage of the 
occasion to announce that three African countries -- Ghana, 
Nigeria, and Tanzania -- had given him their agreement on 
sending 5,500 UN peacekeeping troops to Rwanda. Monique Mas: 
  [Mas] According to Butrus-Ghali what is needed is for the 
genocide to be halted, the refugees to be helped, and the 
humanitarian organizations to be protected. In order to do 
this, the UN secretary general envisages a 5,500-strong force. 
They would be authorized to defend themselves if they are 
attacked, but on the other hand there is no indication that 
these UN peacekeeping troops would have a mandate to defend the 
civilians against the militiamen in the zones where they will be 
deployed. [passage omitted]
