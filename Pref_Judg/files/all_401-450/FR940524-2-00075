6. Policy
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->
When contracting for services, it is the policy of the Federal Government that:
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
a. Program officials are responsible for accurately describing the need to be filled or problem to be resolved through
service contracting to assure full understanding and responsive performance by contractors, and should obtain
assistance from contracting officials, as needed.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
b. Services are to be obtained and used in ways that ensure that the Government retains inherently governmental decision-making
authority.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
c. Services are to be obtained in the most cost-effective manner, without barriers to full and open competition, and
free of any potential conflicts of interest.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
d. Sufficient trained and experienced officials are available within the agency to manage and oversee the contract
administration function.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
e. Effective management practices are used to implement the guiding principles contained herein to prevent waste,
fraud, and abuse in services contracting.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=74 g=1 f=1 -->
7. Good Management Practices
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->
While effective management oversight is required for all types of service contracts, some require less oversight
than others, as, for example, such routine services as lawn mowing and food preparation. Conversely, services that
tend to affect Government decision-making, support or influence policy development, or affect program management
are more susceptible to abuse. These, therefore, require a greater level of scrutiny.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The following sections offer guidance to ensure that good management practices are being followed. Agencies should
involve procurement and program officials when developing requirements for service contracts. Appendix A contains
a series of questions to help analyze and perfect service contract requirements within these guidelines. If the below
guidelines apply, and if the response to any of the questions listed in the appendix is affirmative, agencies should
ensure that they are in compliance with appropriate OFPP Policy Letters applicable to service contracting, and use
good management practices and contract administration techniques. Agencies should also continue to comply with
the FAR guidance for specialized categories of contracting such as research and development (part 35) and architect
and engineering (part 36) as they use the guidance in this Policy Letter.

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=73 g=1 f=1 -->
a. Inherently Governmental Functions
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->
When contracting for services, agencies must ensure that any final agency action reflects the informed, independent
judgment of agency officials. Contractors thus must not be allowed to perform inherently Governmental functions
as defined in OFPP Policy Letter 92&hyph;1, Inherently Governmental Functions (57 FR 45096 (1992)).
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=73 g=1 f=1 -->
b. Cost Effectiveness
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->
When a valid requirement exists, agency officials must ensure that the requirement is obtained in the most cost-effective
manner. If contractor support is deemed appropriate, agencies should ensure that their acquisition strategy will
result in the acquisition of services from a quality vendor that constitute the best value considering costs and other
relevant factors, and yield the greatest benefit to the Government.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=73 g=1 f=1 -->
c. Control
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->
When contracting for services, in particular for highly specialized or technical services, agencies should ensure
that a sufficient number of trained and experienced officials is available within the agency to manage and oversee
the contract administration function. This especially applies to such services as management and professional
support, studies, analyses, and evaluations, and engineering and technical support. Agency officials need to be
able to make sound judgements on what the requirements should be, the estimated costs, and whether the contractor
is performing according to the contract terms and conditions. Agency officials must retain control over, and remain
accountable for, policy decisions that may be based, in part, on a contractor's performance and work products. Agency
officials must also provide an enhanced degree of management controls and oversight when contracting for functions
that closely support the performance of inherently Governmental functions.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=73 g=1 f=1 -->
d. Conflicts of Interest
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->
Agency officials must ensure that any actual or potential conflicts of interest are identified and that appropriate
steps are taken to avoid, neutralized, or mitigate them. Service contracts are not to be awarded to any individual
or organization that is unable, or potentially unable, to render impartial advice or assistance to the Government,
or that has an unfair competitive advantage over competing contractors unless every effort is first taken to mitigate
such conflict or advantage. OFPP Policy Letter 89&hyph;1, Conflicts of Interest Policies Applicable to Consultants,
54 FR 51805 (1989) and FAR subpart 9.5 provide detailed guidance on conflicts of interest.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=73 g=1 f=1 -->
e. Competition
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->
Full and open competition will assure cost effectiveness and reduce the potential for favoritism and conflict of
interest. To maximize competition, the Competition in Contracting Act requires thorough acquisition planning
and limits exceptions. The Act provides that lack of advance planning is not adequate justification for sole source
contracting. Any justification for a noncompetitive contract should provide a detailed explanation as to why competition
cannot be achieved. Plans should be made to minimize the number of subsequent noncompetitive awards.
