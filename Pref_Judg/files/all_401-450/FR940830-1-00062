F. Summary of Citgo's Petition for a Treatability Variance 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Citgo submitted a site-specific treatability variance 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
petition to EPA on April 13, 1994, and submitted additional 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
materials as per EPA's request. The petition requests that EPA 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
allow Citgo to continue land disposing the treated sludge 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
generated by the remediation of the Surge Pond and to meet 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
alternate LDR standards for their F037/F038 nonwastewaters. The 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
alternative treatment standards suggested by Citgo are presented 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
in table B. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Citgo made the following arguments as justification for this 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
request: 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(1) Citgo claimed that incineration is not an appropriate (technology for this waste because 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(a) the tremendous quantity of wastes generated by this 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
remediation exceeds the annual excess capacity available 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
nationwide for F037/F038 wastes (Citgo estimated that the eight 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
incinerators willing to treat their F037/F038 waste can treat 374 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
thousand tons of F037/F038 wastes per year; the Surge Pond 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
remediation will generate approximately 427 thousand tons of waste after June 30), 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(b) the metal content of this waste (4,084 ppm reported average) 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
is higher than that of typical F037/F038 wastes, such that 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
incineration of this waste could release large quantities of metals to the atmosphere, and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(c) the hazards of transporting the waste long distances for 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
offsite incineration exceed the hazards of treating the waste 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
onsite and disposing the residuals in the subtitle C landfill 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
seven miles from the site. Citgo estimated that transportation 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
of 427 thousand tons of waste to offsite incinerators would 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
require a total of 24 million highway miles and result in 48 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
traffic accidents (24 with a possible release of hazardous material to the environment) and 7 traffic fatalities.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(2) Citgo claimed that cement kiln combustion is inappropriate 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
for this waste due to the low BTU content (less than 2,000 BTU/lb) of the waste. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(3) Citgo claimed that, ``When compared with other treatment 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
options, the CITGO approach is clearly the safest for the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
environment and human health.'' 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(4) The company could simply close the impoundment with the waste 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
in place, thus doing no treatment at all.

A. EPA Evaluation of Citgo's Petition 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
After careful evaluation, EPA is proposing to grant a 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
treatability variance for the F037 and F038 nonwastewaters 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
generated by the remediation of the Surge Pond, subject to the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
conditions described in section II.B. Our basis for proposing to 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
grant the petition is described below: 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(1) EPA wants the remediation of the Surge Pond to be 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
completed. Although Citgo has stated that they prefer to close 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the Surge Pond by removal of the sludge followed by a risk 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
assessment, the closure regulations for interim status surface 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
impoundments in &sect;265.228 (52 FR 8708, March 19, 1987, amended 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
at 57 FR 3493, Jan. 29, 1992) allow the option of closing the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
impoundment with the waste in place. This would mean that 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
several hundred thousands tons of untreated hazardous waste could 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
remain indefinitely in an unlined impoundment immediately 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
adjacent to and in hydraulic communication with the Calcasieu 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
River, several miles upstream from the Sabine National Wildlife 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Refuge. Hazardous waste constituents have already been detected 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
in the groundwater collected and analyzed from monitoring wells 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
in the vicinity of the Surge Pond. EPA, the authorized state, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
and the company have worked out an arrangement whereby the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
impoundment can be effectively closed and remediated, and the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
sludge securely disposed after treatment. Thus, the alternative 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
of closing in place appears to be clearly less desirable than 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
partial though substantial treatment of the sludge followed by 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
disposal of the treatment residue in a subtitle C MTR landfill. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
EPA supports the ongoing remediation plan, Citgo's choice to 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
close the pond by removal of hazardous waste, rather than closing 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
with the waste in place. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(2) As noted, Citgo's remediation plan has been approved by 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Louisiana Department of Environmental Quality (LDEQ). LDEQ has 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
also approved a temporary variance to a small source exemption 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
for air emissions which establishes operating specifications for 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
temperature and residence time for the portable thermal oxidizer 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
used to destroy stripped volatile organics. Although regional 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
approval of the remediation plan was not required, EPA Region VI 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
concurs with this proposed treatability variance and is currently reviewing Citgo's plan for risk based closure
of the Surge Pond. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(3) EPA agrees that standards which could necessitate 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
offsite incineration are not appropriate for this waste, within 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the meaning of &sect;268.44(a). The quantity of waste being generated 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
by this remediation exceeds the available incineration capacity 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
for F037/F038 wastes. Although the national capacity variance 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
for this waste has just expired, the fact remains that offsite 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
incineration is not logistically feasible for this large quantity 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
of waste. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(4) The Citgo treatment system achieves oil recovery and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
substantial treatment of some of the regulated constituents. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Citgo estimates that approximately 16 thousand tons of oil will 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
be recovered during the course of this remediation. Waste 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
minimization is a high priority for the Agency and activities 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
achieving recovery of valuable resources are strongly encouraged. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In addition, the Citgo treatment system achieves substantial 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
reduction of most of the regulated constituents. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In short, EPA is proposing to grant the variance request 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
because the treatment technology that is the basis for BDAT ``is 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
not appropriate to the waste'' under &sect;268.44 (a) and (h). The 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
treatment technology is not appropriate because of the enormous 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
volume of sludge needed to be treated and because requiring those 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
standards to be met could result in a net environmental 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
detriment. (EPA is convinced that CITGO, for reasons that are 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
legally permissible, will choose to close its impoundment with 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
hundreds of thousands of tons of sludge left in place.) Under 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
these exceptional circumstances, EPA believes that a treatability 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
variance can be issued and accordingly is proposing to do so 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
here. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Although EPA is proposing to grant Citgo a treatability 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
variance for the F037/F038 wastes contained in and to be removed 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
from the Surge Pond, the company made a statement in their 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
petition with which the Agency does not agree. In particular, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the Agency does not agree that the chemical properties of the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
waste make thermal destuction inappropriate for this waste. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Specifically, EPA does not agree that the metal content of the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
waste is sufficiently high to make the waste nonamenable to 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
combustion.
