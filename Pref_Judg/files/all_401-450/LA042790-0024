We are great at building prisons. In fact, we have four times as many 
individuals per capita in prisons than any other industrialized nation. And 
yet, we can afford so little for prevention of child abuse, the greatest single 
cause of criminal behavior. As Voltaire once said, "The more ancient the abuse, 
the more sacred."

What the story points out is the need for all of us to be more concerned about 
the needs of our most precious resource, tomorrow's children.
