  Professor Toshio Fukuda and others at Nagoya University 
have developed a line-tracing micro robot that travels on its 
own while evaluating its journey. The robot can distinguish 
between the color of the ground (white) and the color of the 
line (black), so its progress is controlled to stick to its 
course. The robot includes an actuator, photo-sensors, and logic 
circuits. Its dimensions are 1 centimeter by 1 centimeter by 1 
centimeter. The micro robot was created for a maze competition. 
Good results were achieved in experiments. 
  The width of the line corresponds to the size of the robot. 
Two photosensors distinguish white from black on the left and 
right. The robot's course is controlled by logic circuits. The 
actuator uses a combination of electromagnets and nylon angled 
hairs. 
  This was developed by Professor Fukuda and his associates. 
It 
uses a coil and an iron core that are drawn and repelled by 
turning electricity on and off. The angled hairs that act as the 
feet of the robot proceed as they are moved forward. A 
distinctive characteristic is that the hairs scratch the ground. 
  There is an electromagnet and angled hairs for both the left 
and right sides. Direction is changed by controlling their 
left-right movement. This was the first time that a 1 cm by 1 cm 
by 1 cm robot with sensing capability and logic circuits was 
used in a micro maze contest. It is noteworthy as a new micro 
robot system.
