  [Text] Chiang Mai -- The Third Army has reinforced the 
northern border with Burma's Shan State to ensure fighting 
between the Burmese army and the Mong Tai Army of opium warlord 
Khun Sa does not spill over into Thailand. 
  Border security sources said local border patrol police, the 
military's special 327 unit and paramilitary troops have been 
put on alert. 
  The sources said the fighting was about 40 km from the 
border 
and so far was not intense. 
  Thais living in the frontier area had not been affected. 
  The wounded from both sides were being sent to Thailand for 
medical treatment, but were being sent back once they recovered, 
according to the source. 
  Khun Sa's army and the government forces have been fighting 
over mountainous areas near Mong Chot in southern Shan State 
since Wednesday. 
  Mong Chot is a strategic Burmese border town about 30 km 
from 
the Thai village of Ban Piang Luang, in the Wiang Haeng district 
of Chiang Mai. 
  Khun Sa's spokesman, Khunsai Jaiyene, said the MTA had 
captured 13 Burmese outposts on three hills surrounding Mong 
Chot, and was advancing toward the town. 
  He hoped the guerrillas would seize the Burmese stronghold 
at 
Doi Pok Hom within the next two days. He said they had already 
surrounded the area. 
  About 500 troops of the MTA 52nd Battalion, led by Maj Saeng 
Som, were used in the attack against about 700 Burmese 
defenders, he added. 
  He said the Burmese had lost 25 men, while the MTA suffered 
18 dead and 45 wounded. 
  Khun Sa's forces had also taken five soldiers and two 
porters 
captive. 
  The border sources said the ethnic Wa had recently sent 
about 
500 troops to assist the Burmese 519th Battalion, which is 
stationed near Mong Chot. 
  The MTA has also sent reinforcements. 
  The sources predicted the fighting would soon intensify.
