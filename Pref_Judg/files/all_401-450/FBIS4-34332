  [Text] A significant number of mills are still grinding 
sugarcane in Cuba, although the largest number of them are 
concentrated in the eastern region where the greatest amount of 
raw material can be found. The complexes are still making an 
enormous effort in the sugar harvest despite the characteristics 
proper to the month of June: a decrease in the amount of 
sugarcane, intense heat, and the raw material being widely 
spread out, in some areas. 
  Raul Trujillo, first vice minister of the Sugar Industry, 
informed Radio Reloj that one of the provinces that is still 
working hard is Pinar del Rio. The Harlem and Manuel Sandino 
complexes have been reinforced by manual canecutting brigades 
from Havana. Trujillo pointed out that in Sancti Spiritus, the 
Uruguay sugarcane complex, the largest complex in Cuba, is 
making a final effort to deliver sugar, aided by the sugarcane 
received from Ciego de Avila Province.
