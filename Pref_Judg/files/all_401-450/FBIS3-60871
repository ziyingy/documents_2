  [Text] Russian Defense Minister Pavel Grachev said that the 
act of terrorism with schoolchildren taken hostage in 
Rostov-on-Don last week was carefully planned. 
  Meeting in Moscow Tuesday with the pilots who voluntarily 
manned the helicopter carrying the kidnappers, Grachev said that 
the terrorists were greeted by a car and a helicopter. 
  Grachev has said that after the terrorists chose a 
helicopter 
as a means of transport, it became clear that they were going 
neither to Iran nor to Turkey. He said that the pilots managed 
to fool the terrorists and land the helicopter at another place 
which helped their prompt detention. 
  Journalists were informed of the terrorists' plans. They 
planned to make a false landing in the Chechen Republic, then, 
by using radio silence, to fly over to Khasavyurt (Dagestan) 
where they were being awaited by their accomplices and a 
transportation means for escape. However, the pilots spotted 
the helicopter on the ground and altered the course of their 
chopper. Bad weather conditions helped the pilots to deceive 
the hijackers and they landed in the suburb of Makhachkala. 
  Congratulating the pilots, Grachev said that the 
helicopter's 
chief pilot, Valentin Padalka, and he fought in Afghanistan for 
almost one year. The minister also said President Yeltsin 
instructed him to give the pilots high state awards. 
  The minister said by their heroic deed Russian pilots raised 
even higher the country's prestige in the international arena. 
During the operation, he said, the army showed cohesion and 
that it was able to accomplish difficult tasks. That is why all 
attempts to disintegrate the army will only weaken it, he said. 
  The minister said that it is planned to complete the 
withdrawal of Russian troops from abroad.
