  [Text] Sofia, December 8 (BTA) -- A total of 96,522 
Bulgarians were born in 1992 and 138,705 abortions were 
performed over the same period, statistics of the National 
Health Prophylaxis Centre show. The results of a related survey 
were made public yesterday, TRUD writes. 
  There are 2.169 million Bulgarian women of a child-bearing 
age, the survey specifies, but the number of those willing to 
have a child is on the decrease. A total of 1,443 abortions 
were performed per 1,000 live births, or 500 up on 1991. 
  Infant mortality is very high. In towns it was 15.4 per 
1,000 population in 1992, that figure being 17 in villages. 
  Statisticians hold the Bulgarian nation dwindles not by the 
year but by the month.
