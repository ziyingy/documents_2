MORE THAN 700,000 barrels of oil are estimated to be still on board the
Haven, the Cypriot-registered supertanker which has sunk off Italy's
north-west coast, threatening an environmental disaster in some of the most
scenic parts of the Mediterranean.
Admiral Antonio Alati, the harbourmaster at Genoa, said yesterday that some
724,000 barrels of the original 1m barrels remained on board. The 232,163
deadweight tonnes tanker - a sister vessel of the Amoco Cadiz which caused a
pollution disaster off France in 1978 - sank on Sunday after exploding and
catching fire.
Italian pollution experts say removing the crude oil may prove more
difficult and costly than cleaning up the oil already spilled.
The whole operation could cost as much as Dollars 50m (Pounds 28m). The
Italian government will be able to draw on funds for the clean-up from an
international fund set up by the International Maritime Organisation.
A formula based on the size of the ship makes the tanker owner, which is
registered as Venha Maritime in Cyprus, liable for the first Dollars 18m of
the clean-up cost. After that, the international fund will provide
supplementary payment up to Dollars 81.5m.
Good weather yesterday helped efforts to deal with the existing six-mile oil
slick by surface skimming. Light winds were blowing the slick towards the
French coast, causing concern in Monaco and on the French riviera that the
oil might wash ashore. Oil has reached Italian beaches.
