A new threat to the future of the Energy Saving Trust, one of the main
planks of the government's environmental strategy, has emerged in talks
between Whitehall departments.
Officials are concerned that the trust's investments, intended to reach
Pounds 400m a year by the end of the decade, could be classified as public
spending rather than private sector.
The trust, which is the largest single part of the government's plans for
meeting international targets on global warming, is intended to find
projects to help gas and electricity customers use energy more efficiently.
The government wants British Gas and the electricity companies to pass on
the project's costs through consumer bills.
However, the financing plans have met with fierce opposition from Ms Clare
Spottiswoode, director-general of Ofgas, the gas regulator.
In Ofgas's annual report, published on Wednesday, she said that the
regulator had an 'overriding duty' to keep prices down, but some of the
trust's schemes would push them up.
Officials from the environment and industry departments and the Treasury
have discussed whether the government will need to legislate to impose a
levy on customers' bills to overcome Ms Spottiswoode's objections. Projects
funded by a levy are likely to be counted as public spending, officials said
yesterday.
Mr John Gummer, environment secretary, is meeting Lord John Moore, former
cabinet secretary and the trust's chairman, on Tuesday to try to resolve the
problems.
