TANGLED UP IN BLUE By Larry Duplechan (St. Martin's: $8.95). The well-rounded 
characters and agreeable style of Larry Duplechan's previous novel, 
"Blackbird," are sadly absent from this turgid potboiler.

A lopsided romantic triangle involving a gay man, a heterosexual woman and her 
husband (who had an affair with the gay man but isn't really gay) unleashes 
numerous and predictable complications, which Duplechan recounts with the 
leaden superficiality of a bad soap opera. The story hits bottom around Page 
68, when the gay man is diagnosed as having AIDS-Related Complex (ARC) by a 
doctor who dismisses the idea of HIV testing and provides no medication or 
treatment. But that still leaves nearly 200 pages of stormy break-ups, tearful 
reconciliations and flaccid declarations of affection. Slogging through this 
bilge approaches an act of masochism, and few readers will care to subject 
themselves to it.
