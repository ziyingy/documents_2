The Department is soliciting nominations for the three seats to be occupied by members possessing specific expertise
in: 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
&bull;the social services aspects of child maltreatment; 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
&bull;the role of elementary and secondary school teaching; and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
&bull;an at-large seat. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The terms of the three seats will expire on May 29, 1999. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Nominations may be made for one's self or for someone else. The same individual may be nominated for a seat in more than
one category. Nominations should be made in the form of a letter which indicates the seat or seats for which the nominee
is being nominated and provides information about the qualifications for office of the nominee. A current curriculum
vita for the nominee should be attached to the letter. (If the nominee is not the person submitting the nomination,
a letter from the nominee indicating a willingness to serve should be attached). All nominations will be evaluated.
To assist in that evaluation, persons submitting nominations may wish to provide the following kinds of information
about the nominee's qualifications: 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
&bull;What general knowledge about child maltreatment (i.e., policy; prevention; intervention; treatment; and
research) does the nominee possess and how has he/she gained that knowledge? 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
&bull;What specific knowledge does the nominee possess about the aspect of child maltreatment which he/she is being
nominated to represent on the Board and how has he/she gained that knowledge? (If the individual is being nominated
for more than one seat, separate answers should be provided setting forth the individual's specific knowledge in
connection with each seat). 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
&bull;What materials has the nominee authored, what presentations has he/she made, what meetings has he/she planned,
et cetera, which shed light on both the general and/or specific knowledge of the nominee? 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
&bull;What skills does the nominee possess which will allow him/her to contribute substantially to the conduct of
Board business and what highlights and achievements in the nominee's career shed light on such skills? 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
&bull;Does the nominee possess other abilities which are relevant to his/her appointment to the Board? 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
&bull;Will the nominee's schedule permit him/her to devote a significant segment of time to Board activities? 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
&bull;Is the nominee's ethnic or racial background that of an American Indian or Alaskan Native, Asian or Pacific
Islander, African-American, or Hispanic? 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Each letter of nomination should be accompanied by at least one but no more than three letters of reference attesting
to the nominee's qualifications for office. Authors of reference letters may include but are not limited to: elected
officials (Federal, State, or local); persons in the field of child maltreatment; and persons in the subject area
of the seat being sought. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Secretary will select the three persons to be named to the Board from among those individuals either who are nominated
in response to this announcement or who are otherwise qualified to serve. After the Secretary reaches a decision,
those persons selected to serve will receive a letter of invitation. Service will begin on May 29, 1995, or the first
Board meeting thereafter. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Nomination packages (letter of nomination; attachment(s); and accompanying letter(s) of reference) must be postmarked
no later than October 31, 1994. Packages received with a postmark later than October 31, 1994 will not be considered.
