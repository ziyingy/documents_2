<F P=106> [Telephone interview with Colombian Attorney General Carlos </F>
Gustavo Arrieta by Dario Arizmendi--live or recorded] 
  [Excerpts] [Arizmendi] Will you fly to the United States 
(in the next few hours) as was reported in a television newscast 
last night? 
  [Arrieta] [Words indistinct] there would not be any doubt. 
For the time being, however, I have no plans to travel. 
  [Arizmendi] What does the Attorney General's Office know 
about the reported plans of three U.S. senators to present in 
the Senate a proposal requesting the removal or resignation of 
Prosecutor General Gustavo de Greiff? 
  [Arrieta] I have no information. To tell you the truth, I do 
not think the U.S. Congress will embark on such a venture. 
  [Arizmendi] Excuse me, Mr. Attorney General, can you expand 
on that? 
  [Arrieta] I have no information on any Congress statement to 
that effect. I repeat: I do not think the U.S. Congress will 
embark on such a venture. Anyway, the Congress would be wrong 
to request the resignation of an independent official appointed 
by another administration and whose term in office is fixed. 
There has been some disagreement between the Colombian 
Government and U.S. authorities over [words indistinct]. 
Senator Kerry has made some remarks in the Senate, but I do not 
think the point has been or will be reached where the 
resignation of a Colombian official is requested. That's 
ridiculous. 
  [Arizmendi] Has the Colombian Justice Ministry, President 
Cesar Gaviria, or the Prosecutor General asked you to travel to 
the United States to discuss this subject so you can present 
your arguments regarding the independence of government branches 
in our country? 
  [Arrieta] I have been in permanent communication with the 
prosecutor general and President Gaviria on this subject. We 
have been making every effort and are using every reasonable 
mechanism to solve this impasse. I have a feeling that we are 
beginning to make some headway. Should it be necessary to 
travel, I will do it gladly. I have discussed this possibility 
with de Greiff, the U.S. ambassador, and President Gaviria. The 
idea would be for me to act as a spokesman to explain certain 
aspects of the administration of justice inherent to the 
obedience to authorities and the division of government 
branches. We would try to clarify certain past 
misunderstandings about this subject. 
  [Arizmendi] Was any aspect of the subject clarified during 
your conversation with the U.S. ambassador in Santa Fe de Bogota? 
  [Arrieta] That is what we have been trying to do. We want to 
make a decision. Some progress has been made and some solutions 
found. I hope we will be able to make progress and establish 
some type of harmonious and cordial working relationship after 
some time. I cannot guarantee that it will happen, but that is 
what we are trying to do. 
  [Arizmendi] Has de Greiff been affected by this public 
controversy and the opposition in the United States to his 
position? 
  [Arrieta] [Words indistinct] the situation is regrettable. 
As 
the result of what I have been discussing with de Greiff, the 
most important aspect of all this process--which I would like to 
leave behind, Dario--is that we are beginning to reach points of 
agreement that will make it possible for us to progress. As I 
have said for some time, Dario, this is too complex a problem 
for Colombia. A confrontation that is simultaneously local, 
interinstitutional, and international with the United States 
would be (undesirable). I think all involved parties agree on 
the need to keep making progress. My talks with the executive 
and the prosecutor general have made me optimistic that we will 
gradually iron out our differences and advance in this process. 
  [Arizmendi] Ten days have already elapsed since you said you 
would again carefully study the request to transfer five inmates 
from Modelo prison to the national prison in Itagui. Do you 
have a reply from the prosecutor general on this subject? Will 
he persist in his position? 
  [Arrieta] I have not heard about his official position on 
the 
subject. I do know that he has requested some additional 
information from the government, which gave him a thorough 
explanation of the government's reservations regarding this 
transfer. I suppose de Greiff is studying the explanation. So 
far, however, there has been no further insistence on this 
transfer. [passage omitted]
