Ulysses, the first spacecraft to break free from the plane of our solar
system, will reach the climax of a 3bn km voyage today when it flies above
the south pole of the Sun.
The Dollars 750m (Pounds 480m) Ulysses mission is a joint project of the US
and European space agencies, dedicated to exploring the heliosphere. This
region contains mainly ions (charged atoms) and electrons emanating from the
Sun - a bubble blown inside the extremely thin cold gas of interstellar
space by the Sun's hot breath, the solar wind. It encompasses the whole
solar system, except for the planets and their atmospheres.
Because the planets were formed from a disc of debris around the newborn Sun
about 5bn years ago, they all lie within one plane, known as the ecliptic,
which is tilted only slightly from the Sun's equatorial plane.
To explore the solar wind and magnetic field, free of the turbulence and
other complications caused by the planets, John Simpson of the University of
Chicago proposed in 1959 sending a space probe over the Sun's poles. The
idea became technically feasible in the 1970s, and in 1977 the European
Space Agency agreed to collaborate with Nasa on the Ulysses project.
No rocket is strong enough on its own to send a spacecraft out of the
ecliptic, because it has to cancel Earth's motion around the Sun of 30
km/sec and build up speed in a new direction. But Ulysses' designers
realised that they could use the gravitational pull of the giant planet
Jupiter to propel their car-sized probe into a new plane, like a slingshot
(see diagram).
All went well from 1977 until 1980, when the project began an odyssey of
setbacks and delays, caused mainly by technical and financial difficulties
at Nasa. Ulysses was eventually launched on a Space Shuttle in October 1990,
seven and a half years after the original target date.
Once in space, Ulysses performed perfectly. Project scientists took
advantage of its swing past Jupiter in February 1992 to make the first
detailed survey of the gigantic system of electrical currents, particles and
magnetic fields surrounding the planet.
On route to the Sun's south pole, the nine scientific instruments on Ulysses
have already made important discoveries about the heliosphere: shock waves
in the solar wind; electromagnetic waves with a very long period (more than
10 hours); regular bursts of energetic particles from the Sun; enormous
clouds of ionised gas; and unexpected patterns of cosmic radiation from
elsewhere in the galaxy. The investigators are still working out the
significance of these observations.
'This is our first ever 'bird's eye view' of the Sun's magnetic poles,' says
Roger Bonnet, Esa's science director. 'This new perspective will cast some
light on the origins of the solar wind and is going to improve our models of
the solar interior.
'It may also enable us to anticipate better the variations of solar activity
and forecast their effect on Earth,' he adds. For example, Ulysses may give
some clues about the impact of the 11-year sunspot cycle on terrestrial
climate.
Although the mission has taken so long to gestate and execute, some
old-timers are still involved. Willis Meeks, Nasa's Ulysses project manager,
has been working on it for 16 years. And Simpson, the 'father of Ulysses',
is in charge of the largest of the nine experiments, which looks at the
behaviour of cosmic rays in the solar wind. 'I have had plenty of
opportunities to fly experiments on other missions,' he says. 'But Ulysses
remains unique, as the first and only foreseeable mission to the polar
regions of the Sun's heliosphere.'
The spacecraft's new polar orbit will carry it over the Sun's north pole
next summer. Although current plans call for the mission to end in October
1995, Esa and Nasa are keen to continue observing until the end of 2001.
They say the modest extra cost, Dollars 50m, would pay large scientific
dividends because the current observations coincide with a quiet period on
the Sun, whereas 2000-2001 will be a period of maximum solar activity.
Whatever happens next, Ulysses has already paid off in Simpson's eyes. 'We
don't have to wonder any longer whether the results will justify the effort
and reward the long wait,' he says. 'We already know they do.'
