  [Text] All Thai drug suppression units must prepare for 
hard work as opium production in the Golden Triangle under 
control of drug warlord Khun Sa reportedly hit a record of at 
least 3,500 tons at the end of last year, Pol Lt-Gen Kowit 
Phakdiphum, the former commissioner of the Narcotics Suppression 
Bureau warned yesterday. 
  Pol Lt-Gen Kowit, who has recently been promoted to 
assistant 
police chief, said that Khun Sa would try to refine the raw 
opium into heroin and traffic the illicit drug to markets abroad 
as soon as possible as he needed a large amount of money to buy 
weapons and food supplies to fight Burmese troops. 
  "Thailand would have to take the heavy burden of cracking 
down on drug traffickers to save the world from narcotics." 
  Pol Lt-Gen Kowit said Thai officials must increase 
cooperation with representatives of 14 countries in Asia, Europe 
and North America now working at their embassies on drug 
prevention and suppression campaigns. 
  Pol Lt-Gen Kowit yesterday bade farewell to his subordinates 
at the Narcotics Suppression Bureau as he was about to leave for 
the North this week to oversee the operations of Police Region 5 
which covers Chiang Mai, Chiang Rai, Mae Hong Son, Lamphun, 
Lamphang, Payao, Nan and Phrae. 
  His successor, Pol Lt-Gen Somchai Milindarangkun, would go 
on 
with a plan to jointly set up a hotline centre on narcotics 
suppression with China. 
  Pol Lt-Gen Kowit said he would join the delegation of Deputy 
Prime Minister Amnuay Wirawan to Rangoon on February 9 for the 
second meeting of Thailand, Laos and Burma on drug suppression. 
  The first meeting was held in Bangkok in 1992.
