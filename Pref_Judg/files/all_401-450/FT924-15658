The wellington boot, forever linked in the public mind with the quilted
jacket to give that essential bucolic look, is about to leave its footprint
on the agricultural industry.
Clares Dickies, an Avon-based workwear manufacturer and supplier, has
launched its Landmaster agricultural safety wellington boot range - claimed
to be the world's first 100 per cent polyurethane welly.
The boot, made from a unique polyurethane compound, is produced by
Vredestein, a leading European safety footwear supplier. It lasts twice as
long as ordinary PVC or rubber boots, but because of its lightness - 1,000g
lighter than rubber - it is easier to wear.
The boot is resistant to oil, animal blood, grease, acid and most chemicals.
There is even an ultra-safety version with steel toecaps - ideal, perhaps,
for dealing with errant ramblers and other farm pests. Coloured green, with
brown soles - they cost about Pounds 22 per pair. Clares Dickies: UK, 0761
