A naval officer received a hero's tribute for alerting sleeping sailors on the 
Conyngham and leading them to safety during a shipboard fire in which he was 
killed. Lt. Cmdr. Algernon Pope Gordon Jr. was awarded the Navy and Marine 
Corps Medal on Friday. It is given for acts of heroism not involving actual 
conflict with an opposing armed force.
