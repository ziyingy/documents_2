The slump in world oil prices since late November has cut into the proceeds
raised by Pearson, the UK-based media group, from the flotation of Camco,
its Houston-based oil services subsidiary.
The company was floated on the New York Stock Exchange yesterday in a deal
which valued it at Dollars 375m (Pounds 252m). The shares were priced at
Dollars 15 each, compared with the Dollars 17-Dollars 19 range at which
Pearson had said it intended to sell a majority stake.
The lower valuation put on the company is in line with the drop in share
prices at other oil services companies in recent weeks.
Lower oil prices prompt companies to cut back or delay exploration and
development work, reducing the demand for drilling and other activities
undertaken by service companies.
Pearson, which also owns the Financial Times, said it raised Pounds 200m in
cash from the sale of 55 per cent of Camco.
Part of the proceeds were in the form of a Dollars 105m repayment of
inter-company debt. In addition to the 13.75m shares sold yesterday, a
further 2m could be sold as part of an over-allotment provision.
The initial public offering was part of a move by the UK company to focus
resources on developing its media interests.
Pearson has said it intends to keep its remaining 45 per cent interest in
Camco 'for a limited period.' The shares were trading at their launch price
of Dollars 15 at lunchtime in New York.
The sale comes at a time of consolidation in the oilfield services industry.
A weak oil price, the need to invest in new technology and the growing
tendency of big oil companies to hire service companies to manage all
aspects of a project have combined to put pressure on smaller companies.
