<F P=106> [Volgograd Oblast Statistical Administration report: "The </F>
Oblast Economy in 1993"] 
  [Text] 
<H5>  Finances </H5>
  According to figures from the oblast financial 
administration, in 1993 the consolidated oblast budget posted a 
surplus of R10 billion [rubles]. 
  According to the Central Bank Main Administration, credit 
investment in the oblast at the beginning of the year was R306 
billion and increased by a factor of four in comparison to 1992. 
The loans extended are being used primarily for current needs 
rather than investment purposes. The proportion of long-term 
loans in the overall volume of credit investment was just 9 
percent. 
  In the first 11 months of 1993 enterprises and organizations 
(not including agriculture) posted profits of R463 billion. 
Despite the significant increase in profits (by a factor of six 
as compared to the previous year), there was no real improvement 
in enterprises' financial or commercial operations due to 
persistent inflation. One enterprise in five in the oblast is 
operating at a loss. 
  The financial situation of enterprises and organizations is 
further complicated by the unsettled status of mutual payments. 
Mutual nonpayment has slowed the flow of goods and resulted in 
difficulties obtaining essential raw materials. At the start of 
December 1993 the unpaid debt of enterprises in the key sectors 
of industry, construction, transportation and agriculture to 
suppliers for goods and services was R222 billion, which is 4.2 
times more than the enterprises' available funds. Unpaid debts 
to those enterprises for products shipped by them totalled R290 
billion. 
  The payment crisis is preventing a solution to the problem 
of 
timely payment of wages and other payments. This problem is 
particularly acute in the agricultural sector. 
<H5>  Privatization </H5>
  Over the past year more than 600 enterprises in the oblast 
have been transferred either partially or entirely to private 
ownership; of these, 36 percent were in retail sales and food 
service, 31 percent in industry, 20 percent in customer 
services, and 11 percent in the construction industry. 
  At the start of 1994 a total of 24 vehicular enterprises had 
been privatized, as well as one rail transportation enterprise. 
  Privatization of enterprises in 1993 yielded revenues of 
approximately R4 billion in cash and more than 350,000 
privatization vouchers. 
  Since the start of privatization more than 217,000 
apartments 
have been privatized in the oblast, or one-third of all housing 
slated for privatization. A total of 119,000 apartments were 
privatized in 1993. 
  Agricultural reforms continued. In the past two years 486 
kolkhozes and sovkhozes have re-registered, and of these 375 
were reorganized. A total of 230 companies with limited 
liability, closed-type joint-stock companies and mixed companies 
have been created out of them, as well as 39 agricultural 
cooperatives, 12 farming subsidiaries belonging to industrial 
enterprises, three open-type joint-stock companies, 24 private 
farm associations and 4,214 independent private farms. 
  At the start of 1994 there were 10,614 private farms with a 
total of 886,600 hectares of land. 
<H5>  Price and Rate Indexes </H5>
  Over the past year retail prices and rates for goods and 
services sold to the public increased by an average factor of 11. 
  During the year food items increased in price by an average 
factor of 10. The largest price increases were for bread and 
dairy products (factor of 18), meat products (more than 10), 
eggs (eight) and sugar, pasta and cereals (four to five). 
  During the year prices at city markets increased by an 
average factor of nine, with prices for milk, eggs and 
vegetables rising by factors of 15-24 and prices for meat and 
butter increased by a factor of 10. 
  The cost of a consumer basket of the 19 most important food 
products was 8.7 times more in December 1993 than in December 
1992. 
  Among nonfood items, the greatest price increases for the 
year were for medicines and chemical products (by a factor of 
28), fuels sold to the public (22) and detergents (16). Prices 
for shoes, clothings, fabrics and electrical appliances all 
increased by factors of 7-10. 
  Paid services to the public increased in price by a factor 
of 
21 over the past year. 
  During the year consumer services rose in price by a factor 
of 13, including sewing and repair of sewn items (by a factor of 
22), beauty salon and photographic services (almost 20) and dry 
cleaning and refrigerator repair (14-15). 
  Wholesale prices for manufactured goods were on average 10 
times higher in December 1993 than in December 1992. 
<H5>  The Social Realm </H5>
  According to preliminary figures the oblast population at 
the 
beginning of 1994 was 2,670,000. 
  During 1993 the demographic situation in the oblast remained 
extremely negative. Natural population loss begin in late 1991 
when the mortality rate first exceeded the birth rate. This 
trend, growing markedly stronger, continued through 1993, which 
was even more negative in terms of natural population 
reproduction. There was a further significant decline in the 
birth rate and an increase in the mortality rate. 
  In 1993 a total of 26,000 people were born in the republic, 
and 37,000 died. In comparison with the previous year the number 
of births decreased by almost 3,000, or by 10 percent, while the 
number of deaths increased by 5,000, or by 15 percent. 
  The primary causes of death remained diseases of the 
circulatory system (58 percent of all deaths) and oncological 
illnesses (17 percent). In third place (13 percent) was death by 
unnatural causes. In comparison to 1992 this figure increased by 
25 percent, with accidental alcohol poisoning up by a factor of 
1.8 in 1993 in comparison to the previous year. The number of 
homicides increased by 20 percent during the period, and the 
number of suicides by 22 percent. 
  Natural population decline totalled more than 11,000 and was 
observed in the cities of Volgograd, Volzhskiy, Kamyshin, 
Mikhaylovka, Uryulinsk and Frolovo, as well as in 27 out of 33 
of the oblast's rayons. Only in Bykovskiy, Kamyshinskiy, 
Nikolayevskiy, Pallasovskiy and Staropoltavskiy rayons was there 
a slight natural population increase due to a higher birth rate. 
  Despite the natural population loss the oblast's population 
increased by almost 10,000 in 1993. This was due to a positive 
migration balance, in which the number of people arriving to 
take up permanent resident in the oblast exceeded the number of 
those leaving. 
  In recent years there has been a change in migration flows, 
resulting in a reduction of the outflow of population from rural 
areas observed in the late 1980's. Recently the size of the 
rural population has begun to increase due to migration from 
other regions and moves by the city's urban population. 
  The city of Volgograd's population continued to decline. At 
the start of 1994 the number of resident population, according 
to preliminary data, was approximately one million and declined 
during the previous year by almost 2,000, as migration-based 
growth was unable to compensate for natural population loss. 
<H8>  Employment </H8>
  As of 1 January 1994 a total of 1.2 million people were 
employed. Of these, 30 percent were employed by enterprises 
under private ownership. 
  According to figures from the Committee on Labor and 
Employment, a total of 25,400 people applied for job placement, 
and of that number 21,500 were not currently employed. Of those 
seeking work more than one-third were young people between the 
ages of 16 and 29. Over the past year the employment service 
placed 14,200 people, or 59 percent of applicants. 
  At the beginning of the current year the number of 
unemployed 
persons was 4,100, mainly women. Unemployment benefits were 
being paid to 3,100 unemployed persons. 
  On 1 January of the current year the number of job openings 
at enterprises was up by a factor of 1.3 over January 1993, with 
12 unemployed citizens for every 10 job openings. 
  During the January-December 1993 period 254,700 individuals 
left jobs at enterprises and organizations in the oblast, or 25 
percent of the average number of employees registered, and of 
this number 14,000 were laid off. For 1993 as a whole latent 
(concealed) unemployment was higher than officially reported 
unemployment. In 1993 a total of 128,000 people were sent on 
unpaid leave at management's initiative, and 41,300 people were 
forced to work part-time due to shortages of materials. 
<H8>  Income </H8>
  The public's income in 1993 totalled more than R1 trillion, 
which was 10 times more than in 1992. This yielded an oblast per 
capita monthly average of R32,000 last year. In December this 
figure was R65,000. 
  The average monthly income of one employee in 1993 was 
R53,000, with pay of R58,000 in industry, R49,000 in 
agriculture, R67,000 in transportation and R68,000 in 
construction. 
  In December of last year employees' average monthly income 
was R127,000. The income of persons employed in health care, 
education and culture remained at 25-30 percent below that level. 
<H8>  The Consumer Market in Goods and Services </H8>
  The volume of consumer goods production in actual 1993 
prices 
was R491 billion. 
  The drop in output relative to last year in comparable 
prices 
was 16 percent. 
  Over the past year cotton fabric production decreased by 29 
percent and footwear production by 41 percent due to 
insufficient supplies of raw materials (cotton fiber and 
leather). 
  Light industrial enterprises showed a decline in their 
output 
of knitted and sewn goods (suits, dresses, skirts, shirts and 
hats). The largest decline was in production of children's wear 
(by 24-53 percent). 
  Production of food products decreased by 13 percent in 
comparison to 1992. There was a drop of more than 15 percent in 
production of meat, butter, pasta and margarine. 
  The total 1993 sales volume for goods and services was R676 
billion, 9.2 times higher than the 1992 level (in actual 
prices). However, the unaffordability of ever more expensive 
consumer goods for many segments of the population reduced 
acquisition of those goods. Actual sales volume declined by 26 
percent. 
  Retail sales, including unregulated sales by private 
individuals, totalled R618 billion. 
  The proportion of food products in the retails sales volume 
of officially registered enterprises was 49 percent. In 
comparison to 1992 there were declines in purchases of salt, 
fresh and canned fish, margarine and sausage by 3-12 percent, of 
butter, cheese and eggs by 15-20 percent, of meat, poultry, 
sugar and canned meats by 21-26 percent, of fresh and processed 
vegetables by 30 percent, and of potatoes by 34 percent. In 
comparison to 1992 there was an increase in sales of vegetable 
oil, fruit and confectionery items by 2-12 percent, of tea by 23 
percent, and of herring by 70 percent. 
  The volume of consumer services performed decreased by 20 
percent in comparison to 1992. This decline in consumer service 
volume was attributable to fewer customers as a result of high 
prices, and to shortages of materials. 
<H5>  Physical Production </H5>
<H8>  Industry </H8>
  In comparison with last year industrial output declined by 
19 
percent, calculated in comparable prices. However, the last 
quarter showed slower decline in industrial output. The main 
problems of last year persist in 1994: non-payment, lack of 
funds for development, high lending rates and tax rates, an 
imperfect pricing system and, consequently, disproportion 
between supply and demand. 
  In 1993 there was a drop in the output of a majority of the 
most important types of product. In the fuels industry 
production of oil, including gas concentrate, declined by 7 
percent in comparison to the previous year. A decrease in 
primary petroleum refining caused a drop in production of key 
petroleum products: heating oil and automotive gasoline by 6-9 
percent, and kerosene and lubricant oils by 16-22 percent. 
  Enterprises in the ferrous metals industry saw a decline in 
output. 
  Enterprises in the chemical industry produced a little more 
than half as many pesticides as in 1992, and there was a 10-15 
percent drop in production of tires for agricultural equipment 
and tractors, animal feed proteins and synthetic rubbers. 
  The drop in output of agricultural equipment, computers and 
tractor engines was 55-89 percent; for bearings, tractors and 
self-propelled cranes output was down by 22-32 percent. 
<H8>  Agriculture </H8>
  According to preliminary figures the 1993 volume of 
agricultural production (in comparable 1983 [sic] prices) 
increased for the first time in three years, totalling R2.4 
billion (112 percent of the 1992 level). There was a 24-percent 
increase in total crop production, primarily attributable to a 
large grain crop, as well as an increase in livestock production 
by privately-owned farms. 
  In 1993 private garden plots and privately-owned farms 
accounted for more than one-third of total agricultural output. 
  The livestock situation remains difficult. The number of 
head 
of beef cattle owned by kolkhozes, sovkhozes and collective 
agricultural enterprises declined by 13 percent in the past 
year, milking herds by 9 percent, pigs by 26 percent and sheep 
and goats by 19 percent. Significantly fewer offspring were 
born. In addition, during the year 71,000 head of cattle and 
161,000 pigs died, or more than one-fourth of all offspring, as 
well as 305,000 sheep and goats, or 64 percent of all offspring. 
Livestock productivity was low. 
  As a result of the negative processes occurring in the 
livestock sector production continues to decline. 
<H8>  Capital Construction </H8>
  Last year the amount of investment by enterprises and 
organizations under all forms of ownership totalled R263 
billion, decreasing in comparison to 1992 by 8 percent in 
comparable prices; for production-related construction these 
figures were R169 billion and a decrease of 19 percent. 
  The value of completed fixed capital was R131 billion, of 
which R86 billion was production-related. 
  Of the 37 facilities slated for completion during the year 
only eight were actually completed. 
  During the year the agro-industrial complex utilized 36 
percent less capital investment funding from all sources 
combined than in 1992. 
  There was a decrease by a factor of two in construction 
investments in the processing sectors of the agro-industrial 
complex. 
  There was some improvement with regard to construction of 
facilities in the social realm. During the year the oblast's 
citizens received 9,900 new, well-appointed apartments with a 
total floor space of 645,000 square meters, or 21 percent more 
than in 1992. 
<H5>  Transportation and Communications </H5>
  Freight shipments by common carrier decreased by 24 percent, 
with decreases in shipments by air of 36 percent, by truck -- 34 
percent, by river -- 14 percent, and by rail -- 12 percent. The 
decline in shipping volume was due to a decline in production 
for many types of product. 
  Rising rates for passenger transportation resulted in 
smaller 
numbers of passengers, for a 7-percent decrease. Decreases in 
individual sectors were: air travel -- 32 percent; river travel 
-- 16 percent; and motor vehicle transportation -- 8 percent. 
Passenger travel by rail increased by 8 percent, as that form of 
transportation was relatively inexpensive and available to the 
public in 1993. 
  Despite an 11-fold increase in the revenues received by 
communications enterprises as compared to last year, those 
enterprises performed 30 percent fewer actual services. 
<H5>  Foreign Economic Relations </H5>
  Companies and entrepreneurs from more than 50 countries 
around the world engaged in foreign trade transactions with 
enterprises, organizations and private companies in the oblast. 
  According to preliminary figures the oblast's foreign trade 
volume was $599 million, increasing by a factor of five in 
comparison with 1992. The foreign trade balance was positive. 
  The oblast's exports to contract holders totalled $502 
million, up by a factor of almost seven. Fuel and energy 
resources comprised more than 85 percent of the oblast's 
exports. Approximately four million tonnes of crude oil were 
exported, as well as 516,000 tonnes of petroleum products, 
approximately 15,000 tonnes of unprocessed aluminum, more than 
15 million meters of cotton fabric, 2,500 tonnes of synthetic 
rubber and other products. 
  Imports totalled $97 million and were up by a factor of 2.5 
in comparison with 1992. The bulk of imports consisted of 
machinery and equipment (33 percent), foodstuffs (sugar, tobacco 
products, coffee, etc.), manufactured consumer goods (clothing, 
footwear, televisions and VCRs) and other products.
