  [Text] Taipei, March 30 (CNA) -- A senior Taiwan official 
Wednesday [30 March] urged the United States to make careful 
assessment before deciding whether to sanction Taiwan over 
wildlife conservation issues. 
  "We hope the U.S. Government and private conservation 
organizations can acknowledge the progress we have made in 
wildlife conservation in recent years," said Vice Chairman Lin 
Shiang-nung of the Council of Agriculture (COA). 
  The Clinton administration is scheduled to decide in April 
whether to impose trade sanctions on Taiwan in accordance with 
the U.S. legislation meant to protect wildlife, known as the 
Pelly Amendments. 
  Some local media quoted COA sources as reporting Tuesday 
that 
the U.S. Government has agreed to follow a recent decision by a 
United Nations wildlife conservation organization to give Taiwan 
more time to improve its conservation measures before taking any 
punitive measures against Taiwan for its failure to stamp out 
its alleged tiger bone and rhino horn trade. 
  Lin, however, denied the reports, saying the council has not 
received any information about a final U.S. decision. "I know 
nothing about whether the U.S. will follow the CITES [Convention 
on International Trade in Endangered Species] decision," he 
noted. 
  Nevertheless, Lin said he earnestly hopes America can take 
note of Taiwan's conservation efforts and technically assist 
Taiwan to eliminate illicit wildlife product trade. 
  "We'll continue to crack down on illicit rhino horn and 
tiger 
bone trade and hope to cooperate with the U.S. in wildlife 
conservation," he added. 
  The UN's Convention on International Trade in Endangered 
Species (CITES) recently agreed to postpone a decision on 
whether to sanction Taiwan until November.
