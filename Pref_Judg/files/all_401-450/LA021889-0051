<P>
In more emphatic language than federal health officials previously have used, a 
U.S. Public Health Service task force Friday issued a new warning about the 
risk of condom failure. 
</P>
<P>
The task force warned that the risk in anal intercourse is so high that the 
practice should be avoided. 
</P>
<P>
And it cautioned that -- even with a condom -- any type of intercourse with a 
person known to be infected with the AIDS virus is so dangerous to an 
uninfected partner that anyone in such a situation should "consider alternative 
methods of expressing physical intimacy."

Panel Convened by Koop 
</P>
<P>
The panel, which included representatives of the U.S. Food and Drug 
Administration, the Centers for Disease Control and the National Institutes of 
Health, was convened last December by Surgeon General C. Everett Koop to review 
the latest condom research data. Koop could not be reached for comment. 
</P>
<P>
The statement was released after publication by the magazine Consumer Reports 
of a new condom survey that ranked condoms by brand and model in terms of 
effectiveness in laboratory tests. The magazine, published by Consumers Union, 
ran the new study as the cover article of its March issue. 
</P>
<P>
The new federal condom policy statement reaffirmed observations by Koop and 
other health officials that latex rubber condoms "are highly effective barriers 
against the passage of the AIDS virus and other sexually transmitted diseases." 
</P>
<P>
But the statement emphasized that the latex products "are not foolproof." The 
warning, the task force noted, is especially applicable to persons who use 
condoms improperly or fail to use them from start to finish of a sex act. 
</P>
<P>
The statement avoided any reference to condoms made from lamb membranes, whose 
ability to prevent passage of the AIDS virus is in dispute. 
</P>
<P>
A task force member who asked not to be identified noted that Consumers Union 
and preliminary findings of an earlier UCLA condom study both reported 
variations in effectiveness among specific condom brands. But the task force 
member said that the panel decided against issuing a statement on differing 
effectiveness rates and any need to shop for condoms carefully among brands 
that have been highly rated in laboratory studies. 
</P>
<P>
"You really can't extrapolate from a small sample (such as those used in 
laboratory studies so far) to an entire product line," the federal official 
said. "Sometimes, a (given condom) will score toward the low end on one test 
and, on someone else's test, at the high end." 
</P>
<P>
The statement released Friday did not break completely new ground in its 
warnings on the inherent high risk of anal sex. Koop had warned against anal 
intercourse as early as October, 1987. 
</P>
<P>
But Friday's statement described the futility of relying on condoms for 
protection in anal sex in starker language than federal officials have used 
previously. 
</P>
<P>
The practice, which is common among gay men, has been repeatedly identified as 
one of the two highest risk behaviors for AIDS transmission. The other is 
intravenous drug use. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
High Inherent Risks 
</P>
<P>
And the conclusion about unacceptably high inherent risks in any sexual 
relationship with a person known to be infected with the AIDS virus was also 
more emphatic than previous comments by Koop. 
</P>
<P>
"This recent review by the Public Health Service confirms the fact that condom 
use can dramatically lower the risk of transmission of the AIDS virus," the 
statement concluded. "However, the effectiveness of condoms in preventing 
transmission depends on the way they are used. This makes it crucial that those 
who use condoms to reduce their risk of acquiring the AIDS virus do so 
correctly."
