Sir, The dilemma highlighted for the scrap industry by Gillian Tett ('Waste
legislation that dealers want dumped', April 10/11) is only one of the
problems to be encountered with the Environmental Protection Act. The
Environment Department might well say that these regulations are being
introduced to ensure that Britain has the highest environmental standards.
But is this practical and can we afford the final cost?
Most reasonable people would expect waste to be useless and undesirable  -
unfortunately this is not so; waste is now defined as 'a substance which is
unwanted (by the producer) or surplus, or anything which is discarded as
being broken, worn out, contaminated or otherwise spoiled', etc. The fact
that the discarded material has a value and is to be recycled or reused does
not prevent it from being controlled waste.
Many items such as sub-soil, demolition hardcore, sawdust and shavings are
of value to farmers but it would be illegal for these to be provided if the
farmer does not hold an appropriate licence to hold or dispose of these
materials.
A shopkeeper providing a customer with an empty box to carry away their
purchases is now liable to a hefty fine.
It is of course quite legal for the demolition hardcore to be used as
landfill, but a farmer seeking hardcore would have to buy stone delivered
from a quarry. Does this help the environment?
In my view this legislation is ill conceived. It makes criminals out of
legitimate businessmen. It is causing an unnecessary increase in disposal
and other costs and will result in an increase in fly-tipping.
How can a government pledged to deregulation and to reducing red tape
consider introducing such legislation?
