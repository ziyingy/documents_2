Repsol, the Spanish state-controlled oil, gas and chemicals group which
recently postponed a global offering planned for this year, lifted pre-tax
profits for the first nine months by 16.6 per cent to Pta113.2bn (Dollars
88m) from the Pta94.5bn in the same period of 1993.
The company said its results reflected the domestic economic recovery as
well as an improvement in its chemical division, an increased contribution
from its gas division and better productivity. It added that the improvement
in margins accelerated in the third quarter.
It said the strong performance in the chemical and gas units compensated for
the downturn in the oil business.
Income from chemicals was up from Pta3.7bn to Pta10.7bn and by 23.1 per cent
to Pta33bn in the gas division. Profits in Repsol refining and oil marketing
division, however, fell by 3 per cent to Pta72bn and dropped by 29 per cent
to Pta11.7bn in the exploration and production division.
Repsol lifted its gas profile earlier this year when Gas Natural, the
dominant domestic gas distributor which is 45 per cent owned by Repsol,
acquired Enagas, the big state-owned importer of natural gas.
Gas Natural has, as result, become the third biggest gas company in Europe
and the virtual monopoly gas importer and distributor in the fast growing
domestic market.
Government plans to reduce its 41 per cent stake in Repsol by as much as
half towards the end of this year through a global offering were delayed
because of the instability of the markets. The offering, however, remains
first on the list of the Spanish state disposals planned for next year.
