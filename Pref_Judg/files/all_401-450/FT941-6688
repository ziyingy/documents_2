The UK's ability to monitor radioactive accidents should be improved to
provide better information about the composition of radioactive plumes and
their effect on local populations, says a report from the Radioactive Waste
Management Advisory Committee.
It points out that the Radioactive Incident Monitoring Network (Rimnet)
cannot adequately detect incidents close to or within the UK, or provide
local information.
Rimnet was set up after the Chernobyl accident in Ukraine in 1986 and
expanded in 1992.
