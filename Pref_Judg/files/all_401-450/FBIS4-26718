  [Text] Guangzhou, 25 Jun (ZHONGGUO TONGXUN SHE)--There 
have been 17 cholera cases in western Guangdong flood-stricken 
areas since these areas were hit by this year's third strong 
tropical storm. But this disease is under control because 
health departments have promptly taken measures. 
  As learned, after floods broke out in western Guangdong, 
drinking water and the aquatic environment in many parts of 
these areas were polluted; some flood victims drank unboiled 
water and ate unclean food, which led to the outbreak of cholera 
rarely seen in years in these localities. Intestinal infection 
and diarrhea began to increase. 
  On the day flooding occurred, the Guangdong Provincial 
Health 
Department sent medical and epidemic prevention personnel to 
western Guangdong to guide medical and epidemic prevention work 
there; it also transported a large amount of disinfectants to 
these localities to sterilize drinking water and the aquatic 
environment. As a result, the epidemic was stopped from 
spreading.
