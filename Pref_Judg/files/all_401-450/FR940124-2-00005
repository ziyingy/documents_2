The EIS will disclose the environmental effects of alternative ways of implementing the Forest Plan. The Forest Service
will analyze and document the direct, indirect, and cumulative effects of the alternatives. In addition, the EIS
will disclose site specific mitigation measures and their expected effectiveness. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Public participation will be especially important at several points in the analysis. People are encouraged to visit
with Forest Service officials at any time during the analysis and prior to the decision. A Final EIS is expected to be
filed in November 1994. Two key time periods have been identified for receipt of formal comments on the analysis: 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
1. Scoping period (now through January 1994). 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
2. Review of the Draft EIS in June 1994. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service, Department of Interior, will be informally consulted throughout the analysis.
To meet the requirements of the Endangered Species Act, the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service will review the EIS and Biological
Assessment of the effects on Threatened and Endangered species, including the grizzly bear, gray wolf, and fall chinook
salmon.

The DEIS is expected to be filed with the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) and available for public review by
May 1994. At that time, the EPA will publish a Notice of Availability of the DEIS in the

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
. After a 45-day public comment period, the comments received will be analyzed and considered by the Forest Service
in the final Environmental Impact Statement (FEIS). The FEIS is scheduled to be completed by November 1994. The Forest
Service will respond in the FEIS to the comments received on the DEIS. The responsible official is the District Ranger
of the Powell Ranger District, Clearwater National Forest, Lolo, Montana 59847. The decision and reasons for the
decision will be documented in a Record of Decision.

The comment period on the Draft Environmental Impact Statement will be 45 days from the date the Environmental Protection
Agency publishes the notice of availability in the

The Forest Service believes, at this early stage, it is important to give reviewers notice of several court rulings
related to public participation in the environmental review process. First, reviewers of draft environmental impact
statements must structure their participation in the environmental review of the proposal so that it is meaningful
and alerts an agency to the reviewer's position and contentions.

statement stage but that are not raised until after completion of the final environmental impact statement may be
waived or dismissed by the courts.

, 490 F. Supp. 1334, 1338 (E.D. Wis 1980). Because of these court rulings, it is very important that those interested
in this proposed action participate by the close of the 45-day comment period so that substantive comments and objections
are made available to the Forest Service at a time when it can meaningfully consider them and respond to them in the final
environmental impact statement.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
To assist the Forest Service in identifying and considering issues and concerns on the proposed action, comments
on the draft environmental impact statement should be as specific as possible. It is also helpful if comments refer
to specific pages or chapters of the draft statement. Comments may also address the adequacy of the draft environmental
statement or the merits of the alternatives formulated and discussed in the statement. Reviewers may wish to refer
to the Council on Environmental Quality Regulations for implementing the procedural provisions of the National
Environmental Policy Act at 40 CFR 1503.3 in addressing these points.
