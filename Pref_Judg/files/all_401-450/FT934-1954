On an April night in 1991, an Italian car ferry, the Moby Prince, ran into
an oil tanker outside the port of Livorno and 140 people died in the blaze.
It was Italy's worst maritime disaster since the second world war. The crew
of the tanker, the Agip Abruzzo, survived. But the radio messages sent by
Moby Prince went unheeded, both by other ships in the vicinity of Livorno -
the accident occurred 2.5 miles out to sea - and on land. One sailor
escaped, but the passengers and the rest of the ferry crew died - the
lifeboats had been burned and the sea was covered in blazing oil.
The Italian courts are still trying to decide what happened and who was
responsible - many on shore and at sea were watching a televised football
match.
The judges are faced by a seemingly inexplicable tangle of negligence and
even possible sabotage. Evidence of explosives was found on the ferry, whose
victims were not discovered until the following day.
Fortunately, tragedies like this are uncommon. But they do emphasise the
need for the speedier introduction of advanced technologies and systems on
shore and at sea not only to prevent loss of life, damage and pollution, but
also to establish the cause of accidents.
Most accidents do not make headlines. Another that did was the sinking of
The Herald of Free Enterprise, a UK ferry, off the Belgian coast in 1987
with the loss of 193 lives. Oil-polluting incidents, such as the grounding
of the Exxon Valdez tanker in Alaska waters in 1989 or the sinking of the
Braer off the Scottish coast a year ago, also gain worldwide attention.
Because not all incidents are reported, statistics may understate the level
of casualties. Last year, 246 people were killed or missing at sea and 213
ships lost, according to Lloyd's Register. In 1991, lives lost were much
higher at 1,204, with vessel losses at 258.
Since the Herald of Free Enterprise disaster, in which the hold flooded
rapidly when the cargo door was not shut, tougher international regulations
are being introduced on internal strength and stability in case of damage
for roll-on roll-off (ro-ro) vessels.
Because of their cavernous cargo capacity, ro-ros - especially older ones -
can become dangerously unstable if not properly handled. There is no
evidence that the Moby Prince was defective. But it is proving hard to find
out what really happened. Captain Profeta Brandimarte, a marine consultant
involved in the investigations, says the response has been blank - 'no one
saw, heard or did anything'.
The investigation would be helped considerably if the ships had been fitted
with a recording device, similar to an aircraft's black box. The mystery of
the Derbyshire, a bulk carrier which sank in a typhoon off Japan 13 years
ago with the loss of 44 lives might also be capable of solution if the
events leading up to its disappearance were available on tape; no trace of
the ship was found.
Black boxes, or voyage event recorders - much bigger than those on aircraft
and able to float free - are among the array of advanced technological
equipment being introduced on worldwide fleets and on shore. Others include
electronic charts, one-man bridges, databases on the condition of ships (for
use by port authorities) and vessel traffic systems in busy areas like the
English Channel and Straits of Singapore.
Malek Pourzanjani, head of research at Southampton Institute's maritime
division, is a firm advocate of VTS. 'This is the way forward - local VTSs
are emerging and being formed into regional and perhaps national and
international centres.' Under forthcoming EU rules, vessels entering
European waters will be required to radio their approach and route ahead of
their arrival to make it easier for authorities to monitor their movements.
Since nearly all the world's cargoes go by sea, maritime safety is of
concern to most governments. The International Maritime Organisation (IMO),
a United Nations body based in London, is responsible for drawing up safety
and pollution conventions. But it is the 147 member countries which are
responsible for enforcing them.
Some are more effective than others. With more shipowners moving to cheaper
foreign flags and crews, implementing conventions such as Solas on safety
and Marpol on pollution has become harder.
Flag state control, in which governments control vessels flying their flag,
does not always work. Hence the increasing emphasis on port state control,
in which the port authorities do the job.
Apart from the proliferation of flags and ship classification societies  -
there are around 50 of the latter - another problem is the increasing age of
the world fleet. The shipping industry has had a rough time as a result of
over-capacity and the failure of freight rates to provide adequate returns.
This discourages new building and leads to vessels being kept in service for
longer than desirable.
The average oil tanker is 16 years old and the average bulk carrier 13
years. 'The market doesn't pay the appropriate return for transportation,'
says James Bell, permanent secretary at the International Association of
Classification Societies (IACS) representing 11 societies covering 90 per
cent of world tonnage.
But commercial and regulatory pressures on owners are increasing. 'It makes
good commercial sense to operate to the highest quality standards,' says
Peter Thomas, a director of Britain's P&amp;O Group, whose passenger and cargo
fleet is being fitted with voyage recorders. 'It affects corporate
reputation and profitability.'
Other western European fleets are also conscious of safety, both for its own
sake and as a part of their image. The recorders are being fitted by
Nedlloyd, the Dutch company, on its North Sea Ferries venture with P&amp;O.
Developed by P&amp;O's subsidiary Three Quays International and its Broadgate
electronics unit, they provide a 24-hour record of radar, position, engine
and other data, including conversations on the ship's bridge.
'This gives investigators access to the quality evidence that aircraft
have,' says Bruce Standring, Three Quays' managing director.
He hopes they will be made mandatory under IMO's safety convention. Also
under discussion within IMO is the issue of whether to build up a
comprehensive database on the quality of individual vessels for use by
ports. This would be along the lines of the one developed by the US
Coastguard.
Electronic charts, which are presented on screen and use positioning data
from satellites and information from ships' own sensors, are another
innovation which owners and seafarers are gradually coming to accept, though
international standards are still being worked out. 'Until about a
year-and-a-half ago, nine out of 10 mariners would have said 'why do we need
this?' It was the typical marine attitude - very conservative and
anti-technology,' says Helmut Lanziner, president of Vancouver-based
Offshore Systems.
Now, he adds, it is a Dollars 1bn a year business. Instead of having to
update charts by hand, with the delays this causes, the task can be done
digitally at extreme speed. This is especially important in confined areas
such as harbours and channels where most accidents occur. It also means
ships need fewer people on the bridge to collect and monitor information.
Hapag-Lloyd of Germany is one company which has adopted the one-man bridge
on its container ships. One specially trained person can run the ship,
surrounded in a cockpit-type enclosure by all the necessary instruments and
indicators.
Yet although the trend is clear, not all shipowners look to the
technological horizon. 'A casual look round the bridge of a ship shows
technology embraced in a piecemeal fashion,' Admiral Sir Julian Oswald told
a recent conference organised by the Southampton Institute.
'Big heavy levers mingle with microprocessors. It's an environment fit for
the ergonomist's black museum.' Unfortunately, all too many ships on the
world's oceans today still meet this description.
