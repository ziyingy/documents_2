SUMMARY: 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
The Food and Drug Administration (FDA) is proposing to amend its current adverse experience reporting regulations
for human drug products and for licensed biological products to provide consistency with the elements of FDA Form
3500A and require the use of this new reporting form; revise certain definitions and reporting periods and formats
as recommended by the International Conference on Harmonization of Technical Requirements for Registration of
Pharmaceuticals for Human Use (ICH) and the World Health Organization's Council for International Organizations
of Medical Sciences (CIOMS); require applicants or manufacturers, packers, and distributors to develop written
procedures for monitoring and reporting adverse experiences; state that reports of adverse experiences that are
forwarded by FDA to the applicant or manufacturer, packer, and distributor should not be resubmitted to the agency;
and make other revisions to the regulations to provide uniformity in adverse experience reporting for human drug
products and licensed biological products. These changes would simplify and facilitate the reporting of adverse
experiences and would enhance agencywide consistency in the collection of postmarketing adverse experience data.
In addition, FDA is proposing to amend the requirements for clinical study design and conduct and the sponsor reporting
requirements in the investigational new drug application (IND) regulations. These amendments are intended to provide
more complete and accurate information that would enable sponsors, investigators, and FDA to determine serious
toxicities of investigational drugs more expeditiously during clinical studies.

I. Background 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=2 -->
In the 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 -->
Federal Register
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 of June 3, 1993 (58 FR 31596), FDA announced the availability of a new form for reporting adverse events and product
problems with medications, devices, and other FDA-regulated medical products. This form is available in two versions.
One version of the form (FDA Form 3500) is to be used by health professionals for voluntary reporting; the other version
of the form (FDA Form 3500A) is to be used by applicants or manufacturers (including licensed manufacturers of licensed
biological products), and other persons subject to mandatory reporting requirements under FDA regulations. Under
existing regulations, drug manufacturers, packers, and distributors and applicants for new drug products and generic
drug products must report adverse events under &sect;&sect;310.305 and 314.80 (21 CFR 310.305 and 314.80). Elsewhere
in this issue of the 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 -->
Federal Register
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
, FDA is issuing a final rule establishing new &sect;600.80. This section makes licensed manufacturers of biological
products subject to certain reporting requirements. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The new form is part of FDA's Medical Products Reporting Program (MedWatch) and is designed to encourage and facilitate
the reporting of adverse events and product problems for most FDA-regulated human medical products by the entire
health care community, including manufacturers, distributors, user facilities, and health professionals. FDA
issued the new form to simplify and consolidate the reporting of suspected adverse events and product problems with
human drug products, biologics, and medical devices, as well as the reporting of adverse events with other FDA-regulated
medical products, such as dietary supplements. FDA has found that, under the current system, there is some confusion
about what to report to the agency and that the existing assortment of reporting forms and systems can interfere with
the efficient reporting of suspected problems. FDA has attempted to clarify and simplify adverse event reporting
with the new form by eliminating redundant or nonessential elements and by clarifying those areas that have caused
confusion. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
FDA Form 3500A replaces current Form FDA&hyph;1639, as well as most other adverse event and product problem reporting
forms currently required by the agency. Adverse events associated with vaccines will continue to be reported through
the FDA and Centers for Disease Control and Prevention Vaccine Adverse Event Reporting System (VAERS). FDA is proposing
to amend the adverse experience reporting requirements for human drug products and for licensed biological products
to be consistent with the elements of FDA Form 3500A.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In developing FDA Forms 3500 and 3500A, the agency considered several recommendations from ICH and CIOMS. These organizations
were formed to facilitate international consideration of issues, particularly safety issues, concerning the use
of both foreign and domestic data in the development and use of drugs and biological products. ICH has worked to promote
the harmonization of technical requirements for the registration of pharmaceutical products among three regions:
The European Union, Japan, and the United States. ICH has prepared a draft guideline specific to parts of this issue
entitled: ``Clinical Safety Data Management: Definitions and Standards for Expedited Reporting.'' In the 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 -->
Federal Register
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 of July 9, 1993 (58 FR 37408), FDA published this draft guideline for public comment. Several CIOMS working groups
have worked to coordinate and standardize the international reporting of postmarketing adverse drug reactions
by pharmaceutical manufacturers to regulatory authorities. CIOMS Working Group II has proposed an international
system of standardized time intervals, formats, and inclusion criteria in order to lessen confusion and reduce preparation
time among manufacturers and to enable them to report postmarketing adverse experiences more rapidly, efficiently,
and effectively (Refs. 1 and 2). FDA believes that many changes recommended by CIOMS and ICH would result in more effective
reporting of serious adverse experiences to regulatory authorities worldwide. FDA is proposing to amend the adverse
experience reporting requirements for human drug products and licensed biological products in part to be consistent
with certain standardized definitions, procedures, and formats proposed by these international organizations.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
FDA is also proposing to amend the requirements for clinical study design and conduct and the sponsor reporting requirements
in the IND regulations. These amendments are intended to provide more complete and accurate information that would
enable sponsors, investigators, and FDA to determine serious toxicities of investigational drugs more expeditiously
during clinical studies. A clinical study of fialuridine (FIAU) resulted in several instances of severe liver and
pancreatic injury and five deaths, beginning in June 1993. This incident prompted FDA to establish a task force to
see whether the data available before the study gave any suggestion of the serious toxicity that emerged, and whether
some differences in process or behavior by investigators and sponsors might have made it possible or more likely for
them to have anticipated the toxicity in the 1993 study. The proposed IND amendments contained in this document are
largely the result of recommendations by this task force.

II. Description of the Proposed Rule
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 -->
A. Replacement of Form FDA&hyph;1639 and How to Obtain Copies of FDA Form 3500A
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
FDA's existing regulations at 21 CFR 20.112, 310.305, and 314.80 refer to Form FDA&hyph;1639. The agency is proposing
to amend these regulations to replace references to Form FDA&hyph;1639 with new FDA Form 3500A. This change is necessary
because new FDA Form 3500A replaces Form FDA&hyph;1639 (58 FR 31596).
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The existing regulations at &sect;&sect;310.305(d)(4) and 314.80(f)(4)) also provide an address where a person
may obtain copies of Form FDA&hyph;1639. FDA is proposing to amend these regulations to state where a person can obtain
copies of FDA Form 3500A. Ten or fewer copies of FDA Form 3500A and a copy of the instructions for completing the form
can be obtained from the Division of Epidemiology and Surveillance (HFD&hyph;730), Center for Drug Evaluation and
Research, Food and Drug Administration, 5600 Fishers Lane, Rockville, MD 20857. Large numbers of copies (greater
than 10 copies) may be obtained by writing to the Consolidated Forms and Publications Distribution Center, Washington
Commerce Center, 3222 Hubbard Rd., Landover, MD 20785.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 -->
B. Definitions of ``Data Lock-Point'' and ``International Birth Date'' 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
FDA is proposing to amend &sect;&sect;314.80(a) and 600.80(a) to define the terms ``data lock-point'' and ``international
birth date.'' The ``data lock-point'' is the end of the reporting period (cutoff date) for data to be incorporated
into a specific postmarketing adverse experience periodic report. On this date, the data available to the reporter
are held for review and evaluation by the applicant or licensed manufacturer prior to being submitted to FDA. The international
birth date is the date that the first regulatory authority in the world approved the human drug or biological product
for marketing. As explained further in section II.E. of this document, each 6-month anniversary of the international
birth date is the data lock-point for data to be incorporated into a specific postmarketing adverse experience periodic
report.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The proposed rule would define these terms because they describe the standardized international reporting period
developed by CIOMS for submitting postmarketing adverse experience reports. CIOMS developed this standardized
reporting period to lessen confusion and to enable applicants and licensed manufacturers to prepare and submit similar
reports of adverse experiences to regulatory authorities. It would also reduce preparation time among applicants
and licensed manufacturers because it eliminates varying due dates presently required for submitting postmarketing
adverse experience reports to regulatory authorities worldwide. FDA believes the CIOMS reporting schedule, which
decreases reporting rates currently required by FDA for drug and licensed biological products for the first 3 years
of marketing from every 3 months to every 6 months and increases it thereafter from every 12 months to every 6 months,
permits adequate time for reporters to make periodic submissions to regulatory authorities. In addition, the agency
believes that the proposed reporting frequency is sufficient to notify FDA of potential postmarketing safety problems
that do not require expedited reporting. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 -->
C. Definition of ``Serious''
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
FDA's existing adverse experience reporting regulations (21 CFR 310.305(b)(4), 312.32(a), 314.80(a), and 600.80(a))
define a serious adverse experience as one that is ``fatal or life-threatening, is permanently disabling, requires
inpatient hospitalization, or is a congenital anomaly, cancer, or overdose.'' Consistent with new FDA Form 3500A
and with recommendations by the ICH and CIOMS, the proposed rule would amend this definition to read as follows: 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=3 -->
Serious
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->
 means an adverse drug experience occurring at any dose that is fatal or life-threatening, results in persistent or
significant disability/incapacity, requires or prolongs inpatient hospitalization, necessitates medical or
surgical intervention to preclude permanent impairment of a body function or permanent damage to a body structure,
or is a congenital anomaly.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The agency is proposing to remove ``cancer'' from the definition because cancer would most often be reported under
the other broader elements in the definition. For example, cancer may be reported as life-threatening or requiring
inpatient hospitalization. Other diseases or conditions that may be life-threatening or require hospitalization,
such as heart disease or myocardial infarction, have not been identified as separate elements in previous definitions,
and the agency believes it is not necessary to single out cancer. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The proposed amendment would also remove ``overdose'' from the definition of serious. Reports of overdoses that
had serious outcomes would still be reported under the other broader elements in the definition. Reports of overdoses
that did not lead to outcomes defined as serious would provide the agency with less critical safety information.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
By adding the phrase ``occurring at any dose'' after ``adverse drug experience'' in the definition, the agency will
ensure that a serious adverse experience at any dose, whether it is the labeled dose or a different dose, including
an overdose or an underdose, should be reported. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
FDA is also proposing to clarify the phrase ``is permanently disabling'' by substituting ``results in persistent
or significant disability/incapacity.'' This change is intended to clarify that a disability need not be permanent
to be considered a serious adverse experience. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The proposed amendments would also modify the phrase ``requires inpatient hospitalization'' to read ``requires
or prolongs inpatient hospitalization.'' This change is intended to cover those situations where a serious adverse
experience occurs while the patient is already hospitalized, and the adverse experience prolongs the patient's
hospital stay. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
FDA is also proposing to add the phrase ``necessitates medical or surgical intervention to preclude permanent impairment
of a body function or permanent damage to a body structure.'' The agency believes such events should be considered
serious adverse experiences and should be reported. This change is also consistent with ICH's proposed definition
of a serious adverse event. FDA notes that a serious adverse experience would not include the discontinuation of therapy,
changes in dosage, or routine treatment with a prescription medication.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 -->
D. Definitions of ``Disability'' and ``Life-Threatening''
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The proposed rule would amend &sect;&sect;310.305(b), 314.80(a), and 600.80(a) to define the terms ``disability''
and ``life-threatening.'' These terms further explain what constitutes a serious adverse experience. ``Disability''
means a substantial disruption of one's ability to carry out normal life functions. ``Life-threatening'' means
that the patient was, in the view of the initial reporter, at immediate risk of death from the adverse experience as
it occurred. It does not include an adverse experience that, had it occurred in a more serious form, might have caused
death. For example, product-induced hepatitis that resolved without evidence of hepatic failure would not be considered
life-threatening even though hepatitis of a more severe nature can be fatal. Similarly, an allergic reaction resulting
in angioedema of the face would not be life-threatening, even though angioedema of the larynx, allergic bronchospasm,
or anaphylaxis can be fatal. FDA believes these definitions will help enable reporters to determine when a serious
adverse experience occurs.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 -->
E. Periodic Adverse Experience Reports
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Current regulations (&sect;&sect;314.80(c)(2)(i) and 600.80(c)(2)(i)) require the submission of periodic postmarketing
reports at quarterly intervals for 3 years from the date of approval of the application, and then annually. Quarterly
reports must be submitted within 30 days of the close of the quarter (the first quarter beginning on the date of U.S.
approval of the application); each annual report must be submitted within 60 days of the date of U.S. approval of the
application.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
FDA is proposing to revise this schedule by requiring the submission of periodic postmarketing adverse reaction
reports every 6 months. The first 6-month anniversary of the international birth date after the application is approved
in the United States is the data lock-point for the first periodic reporting term. Each subsequent 6-month anniversary
of the international birth date is the data lock-point for subsequent periodic reporting terms for that particular
product. The proposed rule would require periodic reports to be submitted to FDA within 45 days after the data lock-point.
For example, a product approved by FDA, or licensed, if a biological product, on June 15, with an international birth
date of April 1, would have its first data lock-point on October 1, which is less than 6 months after FDA approval, but
which is the 6-month anniversary of the international birth date. Therefore, the first periodic report would be for
the period of June 15 to October 1 and would be due at FDA by November 14. The second periodic report would cover October
2 to April 1 and would be due to the agency no later than May 15. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The proposed rule would create the same reporting schedule based on the international birth date and data lock-point
for licensed biological product distribution reports under &sect;600.80(c)(3).
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
This new reporting schedule is consistent with the standardized international reporting period proposed by the
CIOMS II Working Group. This working group has recommended that all international regulatory authorities accept
the same reporting schedule in order to lessen confusion and reduce preparation time by manufacturers, rather than
the current system of varying due dates. FDA believes the CIOMS reporting schedule, which decreases reporting rates
currently required by FDA for drug and licensed biological products for the first 3 years of marketing from every 3
months to every 6 months and increases reporting rates thereafter from every 12 months to every 6 months, permits adequate
time for reporters to make nonexpedited submissions to regulatory authorities. In addition, FDA believes that the
proposed reporting frequency is sufficient to alert the agency to potential postmarketing safety problems that
are not within the categories requiring 15-day ``Alert reports.'' 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Applicants and licensed manufacturers who wish to submit periodic postmarketing adverse experience reports at
different intervals could, under proposed &sect;&sect;314.80(c)(2)(i) and 600.80(c)(2)(i), submit a request
for a waiver under 21 CFR 314.90 or 600.90 to alter the reporting intervals for these periodic reports. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Proposed &sect;&sect;314.80(c)(2)(i) and 600.80(c)(2)(i) would also amend the reporting requirements for periodic
postmarketing adverse experience reports to state that, in cases where the applicant or licensed manufacturer has
received no reports of adverse experiences during a reporting period, the applicant or licensed manufacturer should
submit a copy of the current approved labeling and a letter to the agency in place of a periodic postmarketing adverse
experience report. The letter should identify the product, the application number, and the reporting period, and
state that no adverse experience reports were received during that reporting period.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Sections 314.80(c)(2)(ii) and 600.80(c)(2)(ii) set forth the contents currently required for a periodic report:
(1) A narrative summary and analysis of the information in the report and an analysis of the 15-day postmarketing Alert
reports submitted during the reporting interval; (2) a report describing each adverse experience not previously
reported; and (3) a history of actions taken since the last periodic report. FDA is proposing to amend these regulations
to provide a more extensive list of contents for a periodic postmarketing adverse experience report, as follows:
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=81 g=1 f=1 -->
1. Title Page, Table of Contents, and Introduction
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
This section would provide a summary of the periodic report with page references to detailed data and information.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=81 g=1 f=1 -->
2. Applicant's Core Safety Data Sheet
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The applicant's core safety data sheet would be a document prepared by the applicant that contains all relevant safety
information, including adverse drug experiences, which the applicant believes should be listed for the drug in all
countries where the drug is marketed. It may be used by the applicant as the reference document by which an adverse drug
experience is judged to be expected or unexpected for purposes of this postmarketing periodic report. For all other
determinations of whether an adverse drug experience is expected or unexpected, the definition in &sect;&sect;314.80(a)
or 600.80(a) would apply.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
FDA recognizes that the postmarketing periodic report may be submitted by the applicant to multiple countries and
the product may have different approved labels in the different countries. The use of the applicant's core safety
data sheet as the reference document for determining whether an adverse drug experience is expected or not may result
in some overreporting of unexpected adverse events that actually are expected by the U.S. approved product label.
This is because the approved label for the United States may have more safety information included in it than the manufacturer's
core safety data sheet. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
An applicant may also use the approved U.S. label as the reference by which expected and unexpected adverse drug experiences
are determined for the postmarketing periodic report. If an applicant chooses to use the approved U.S. label for this
purpose, it must clearly be stated in this section of the report. In all instances, if an adverse event is not listed
in the U.S. label, but is in the manufacturer's core safety data sheet, this shall be clearly noted in the ``Overall
safety evaluation'' (see section II.E.8. of this document).
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
This section would also highlight clearly any changes and the reasons for the changes in the applicant's core safety
data sheet since the previous postmarketing periodic report.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=81 g=1 f=1 -->
3. The Product's Marketing Status
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
This section would contain, in tabular form, a chronological history of the marketing status of the product worldwide
(all regulatory and marketing decisions affecting the product) from the date it was first approved through its current
status. Approvals or applications voluntarily withdrawn for safety reasons would have to be included. The product
would be listed by chemical (U.S. Adopted Names, international nonproprietary names, or proper name in accordance
with ``Chemical Abstracts Nomenclature Standards'') and brand name(s).

4. Regulatory Actions for Safety Reasons 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
This section would identify in narrative form the reasons for significant regulatory authority or manufacturer-initiated
actions taken anywhere in the world, or to be taken imminently, for safety reasons during the reporting period. This
would include, for example, application withdrawal or license suspension or failure to renew, distribution restrictions,
clinical trial suspension, labeling changes due to significant safety concerns, dosage modifications, or pharmaceutical
changes.

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=81 g=1 f=1 -->
5. Patient Exposure
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
This section would include the product's domestic and foreign marketing distribution data during the reporting
period. This information would be used to calculate the extent of patient exposure. The method used by the manufacturer
to estimate patient exposure would always be described and would include the total number of dosage units of each dosage
form and strength or potency (e.g., 100,000/5-milligram tablets, 50,000/10-milliliter vials).
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=81 g=1 f=1 -->
6. Individual Case Histories
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
These reports would be presented in line listing format with the following 10 columns: country, source, age, gender,
dose, duration of treatment (prior to event), time to onset, description of reaction (as reported), outcome (e.g.,
fatal, resolved), other comments (e.g., manufacturer's report number). This format is consistent with that suggested
by CIOMS. In addition, a tabular summary of the number of adverse events by body system may be included. The individual
case reports would consist of adverse drug experiences that are: (a) Serious, unexpected reports from published
or unpublished clinical studies where it has been concluded that there is a reasonable possibility that the drug or
licensed biological product caused the adverse experience; (b) serious, expected or unexpected spontaneous adverse
drug experience reports and nonserious, unexpected spontaneous adverse experience reports received directly
by the applicant or licensed manufacturer from the initial reporter or received by the applicant or licensed manufacturer
from a drug regulatory authority, both U.S. or foreign; and (c) serious, expected or unexpected individual published
case histories and nonserious, unexpected individual published case histories. This section would end with an analysis
by the reporter, in narrative form, of the cases submitted. The applicant or licensed manufacturer would also attach
to the end of the postmarketing periodic report a completed FDA Form 3500A for all U.S. spontaneous reports of adverse
experiences except those not to be included in the periodic report as specified in proposed &sect;&sect;314.80(c)(1)(i)
and (c)(1)(ii) and 600.80(c)(1)(i) and (c)(1)(ii), or those sent by FDA to the applicant or licensed manufacturer.

7. Safety Studies 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
This section would analyze and discuss fully and critically all toxicological, clinical, and epidemiological studies
containing important safety information. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=81 g=1 f=1 -->
8. Overall Safety Evaluation
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
This section would provide critical analysis of the safety information provided in the periodic report as it pertains
to serious unexpected reactions, increased frequencies of known toxicity, reactions listed in the manufacturer's
core safety data sheet but not included in the U.S. label, drug or licensed biological product interactions, overdose,
drug or licensed biological product abuse, experiences during pregnancy or lactation, chronic treatment, pediatric
or geriatric treatment, and new safety issues. For each of these areas, any absence of significant information would
be reported. The evaluation would indicate whether the safety profile of the product remains consistent with cumulative
experience to date and with the previous manufacturer's core safety data sheet. The evaluation would specify any
action recommended and the reasons for such recommendations.

9. Other Information
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
This section would consist of important information received after the data lock-point. It may include significant
new cases or followup data that affect the interpretation or evaluation of existing reports.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=81 g=1 f=1 -->
10. FDA Form 3500A
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
This section would consist of a completed FDA Form 3500A for each spontaneous U.S. adverse drug experience not reported
under paragraphs (c)(1)(i) and (c)(1)(ii) in &sect;&sect;314.80 and 600.80. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=81 g=1 f=1 -->
11. Location of Adverse Experience Records
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
This section would identify the current address(es), including street, city, State, and zip code, where all adverse
experience reports and records are maintained.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
This revised list of contents for periodic postmarketing adverse experience reports is generally consistent with
the international system of standardized postmarketing periodic reporting procedures and formats proposed by
the CIOMS II Working Group. This standardization would allow applicants and licensed manufacturers to prepare a
single postmarketing periodic report of adverse experiences for regulatory authorities worldwide. The agency
also believes that the proposed rule would improve reporting and would enhance FDA's ability to monitor potential
postmarketing safety problems. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
As a result of this proposed revised list of contents for periodic postmarketing adverse experience reports, FDA
is proposing to remove &sect;&sect;314.80(c)(2)(iii) and 600.80(c)(2)(iii). These sections state that periodic
reporting does not apply to information obtained from postmarketing studies, reports in the scientific literature,
and foreign marketing experience. The proposed revised list of contents would include such information.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 -->
F. IND Amendments
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
FDA regulations governing the use of investigational drugs in clinical investigations are contained in part 312
(21 CFR part 312). In order to conduct a clinical investigation using an investigational drug, a sponsor must first
submit an IND, described in &sect;312.23, which contains, among other things, a description of the drug, the results
of preclinical studies intended to show that the drug can be introduced into humans with reasonable safety, and a proposed
protocol for the investigation. This protocol provides a description of all aspects of the study, including the identity
and qualifications of the investigators conducting the study, procedures and criteria for selecting subjects,
the amount of the drug to be administered, the duration of use, the observations to be made to assess the effects of the
drug, and the clinical procedures, laboratory tests, and other measures carried out to minimize risk to the patient.
After the IND becomes effective and the investigational drug is being administered to human subjects, the sponsor
is required under &sect;312.32 to make both telephone and written safety reports on serious and unexpected adverse
experiences associated with the administration of the drug, as well as written reports only, on other serious adverse
events associated with administration of the drug. Under current &sect;312.33, the sponsor is also required to submit
an annual report containing significant safety and other information. If FDA concludes that a study would place subjects
at unreasonable and significant risk, FDA may place a study on clinical hold. This means that the drug may not be administered
to subjects until the hold is lifted (see &sect;312.42). FDA may also terminate the study under &sect;312.44 based
on such safety concerns.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
FDA is concerned that these IND reporting requirements may not be adequate to protect against some unexpected adverse
events. For example, there is a potential for such events to be disguised by patient conditions that might lead the
investigator to conclude that the experimental drug was not implicated in those events. The agency believes that
certain modifications in the way clinical investigations are conducted and reported may help to ensure that drug
toxicity is detected as early as possible. A recent internal task force that examined an incident that involved a fatal
drug toxicity that was not detected in early trials has recommended improvements in IND reporting that the agency
is incorporating into this proposal for public consideration. These improvements, as explained below, are intended
to provide more frequent and more complete evaluations of potentially serious adverse effects so that drug-related
events can be detected earlier by sponsors, investigators, and FDA. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
A clinical study of a nucleoside analog, FIAU, resulted in several instances of severe liver injury and five deaths,
beginning in June 1993. The study involved 15 subjects with chronic hepatitis B virus infection. FIAU had been considered
a highly promising agent without recognized serious toxicity. This incident prompted FDA to establish a task force
to see whether the data available prior to the study gave any suggestion of the serious toxicity that emerged. The task
force examined data from the 1993 FIAU study as well as data from previous studies on FIAU and a closely related drug
conducted by another sponsor. The data from these previous studies was, or should have been, available to the sponsor
of the 1993 FIAU study. The task force was also to determine whether some differences in process or behavior by investigators
and sponsors might have made it possible or more likely to have anticipated the toxicity. The proposed IND amendments
contained in this document are largely the result of recommendations by the task force (Ref. 3).
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Focusing on hepatic and pancreatic adverse events, the task force reviewed the data and data analyses that were available
to investigators, sponsors, and FDA at the start of the study to determine whether improvements in the rules governing
design, analysis, and reporting of data from clinical studies were warranted. The task force found a number of observations
and events that suggested an association between FIAU and hepatic and/or pancreatic abnormalities. However, none
of these events was attributed by the sponsors or investigators to FIAU. Rather, each event, even when recognized
as temporally related to a study, was attributed by investigators and sponsors to other factors, such as concomitant
drug administration and/or concurrent illness. The task force found that an overview of the data, in which deaths
and serious adverse experiences were analyzed cumulatively, and, with the hypothesis that the events were drug related,
was not produced and thus was not available for use by the sponsors, the principal investigators, or FDA reviewers.
Rather, the analyses performed focused on each individual event and determined a plausible explanation, other than
drug toxicity, for each occurrence. The task force recommended that, to detect similar patterns of events reflecting
toxicity in future studies, sponsors should conduct cumulative analyses with a systematic consideration of the
possibility that the adverse events are caused by the investigational drug. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The proposed IND amendments would apply to all investigational studies conducted under part 312. However, FDA invites
comments from the public and industry on whether any or all of the proposed requirements should apply only to certain
IND's, whose selection could be determined by application of criteria that could be included in these regulations,
or only to certain phases of drug testing.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=81 g=1 f=1 -->
1. Clinical Study Design
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
FDA is proposing to amend the requirements governing IND format and content in &sect;312.23. Under current &sect;312.23(a)(6),
an IND must contain the protocols for each planned study, including information such as a statement of the study's
objectives and purpose, the criteria for patient selection and exclusion, a description of the study design, the
method for determining the dose(s) to be administered and the duration of individual patient exposure to the drug,
and a description of clinical procedures, laboratory tests, or other measures to be taken to monitor the effects of
the drug in human subjects and to minimize risk.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In several instances, FDA's FIAU task force found that deaths and serious hepatic and pancreatic injuries that appear
in retrospect to have been related to FIAU were attributed by investigators and sponsors to the subjects' underlying
disease or to other drugs the subjects were taking for their conditions. The task force made several recommendations
intended to improve the likelihood that clinical studies will identify, early in drug development, drug toxicity
that mimics the underlying disease or the toxicity of concomitant medications. These recommendations include:
(1) Choosing study designs and safety endpoints that increase a study's ability to distinguish drug toxicity from
underlying disease or other drug toxicity; (2) prospectively identifying observations that will trigger certain
actions by investigators; and (3) summarizing safety data at regular intervals with systematic considerations
of the possibility that adverse events are drug related. The proposed rule would create new &sect;312.23(a)(6)(iii)(h)
to require that the protocols describe any adverse clinical or laboratory outcomes in the study that are to be immediately
reported to the sponsor. These reportable events might include death, any life-threatening event, or any other serious
event that might reflect potential drug toxicity, as suggested by preclinical data, and include abnormal laboratory
results falling outside of a specified range. The identified events and abnormal laboratory values are to include
those that focus attention on toxicity that may target the same organs and body systems as the underlying disease or
concomitant medications. Under the proposal, these events would be reported to the sponsor even if they are potentially
attributable to the patient's underlying disease or concomitant medications. Proposed &sect;312.23(a)(6)(iii)(h)
would also require instructions for investigators, such as reporting requirements, remeasurement or challenge
procedures, or discontinuation of the drug in response to identified events. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The task force also recommended that sponsors consider the use of a control group (for example, placebo, active control,
or historical control) in studies that focus on safety when the underlying disease process is likely to produce adverse
events that might be confused with drug toxicity. The task force concluded that such controls would help detect some
adverse events. Consequently, proposed &sect;312.23(a)(6)(iii)(
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
i
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
) states that sponsors should consider the use of a formal control group when the underlying disease is likely to produce
adverse events that might be confused with drug toxicity.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The task force also recommended that sponsors attempt to estimate the expected incidence of death and serious adverse
events in the study population that arise from the underlying disease or concomitant medications used to treat the
disease. This recommendation is reflected in proposed new &sect;312.23(a)(6)(iii)(
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
j
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
) that would require sponsors to provide such estimates. Under the proposal, any deaths or adverse events that exceed
the estimates would create the presumption that the events are associated with use of the investigational drug, and
the sponsor would be required to submit a written safety report to FDA.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The task force found that the followup periods in some of the FIAU and related studies were too short to detect some of
the adverse events that occurred because significant adverse events sometimes occurred weeks to months after dosing
with FIAU ended.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The task force recommended that all protocols contained in the IND include an explicit description of the length and
type of followup to be performed so that the agency may review the followup procedures (task force report at 57). Accordingly,
FDA is proposing to add new &sect;312.23(a)(6)(iii)(k) to require that the protocol section of an IND specify and
justify the length and type of followup for subjects after the conclusion of dosing. The justification may be brief;
for example, a reference to a study of a similar drug with the same followup period. The followup period would ensure
that clinical studies are adequately designed to detect drug toxicity that occurs after the conclusion of drug dosing.
The sponsor would propose an appropriate followup period based on preclinical data, experience with other members
of the drug class, the drug's mechanism of action, and prior human experience. The intensity of the followup may change
with time; e.g., a full evaluation might be scheduled for 2 weeks postdosing, with a telephone followup for possible
serious events at a later time. Ordinarily, in Phase 1 and 2 studies, telephone followup should occur at 3 months after
the dosing is completed, but alternative timeframes and procedures can be proposed by the sponsor. For some drugs,
like FIAU, a review of available data may suggest that the minimum followup period should be longer than 3 months. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Current regulations in &sect;312.56 require sponsors to review and evaluate the evidence relating to a drug's safety
and effectiveness as it is obtained from investigators. The regulations also require sponsors to report safety information
to FDA. The task force observed that in the FIAU study sponsors may not have had available adequate resources to evaluate
safety data reported by investigators. The proposed rule would amend &sect;312.56(c) to require sponsors, in addition
to reviewing and evaluating safety and effectiveness information, to develop a safety monitoring and evaluation
program before starting clinical trials. This provision is intended to ensure that sponsors have or will develop
adequate resources to evaluate safety data reported by investigators and is consistent with the task force's recommendations
(see task force report at 57). Consistent with this proposed requirement, FDA is also proposing in new &sect;312.23(a)(3)(v)
that an IND contain a description of any safety monitoring and evaluation program. This description would be in addition
to the introductory statement and general investigational plan that are required under current regulations.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=81 g=1 f=1 -->
2. Safety Reports
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
FDA is proposing several amendments to the requirements for IND safety reports in &sect;312.32. FDA is proposing
to alter the period for submitting written safety reports, under &sect;312.32(c)(1)(i) and (d)(3), from 10 working
days to 15 calendar days, and for submitting safety reports by telephone, under &sect;312.32(c)(2), from 3 working
days to 7 calendar days. FDA is also proposing to allow telephone safety reports to be made by facsimile transmission
as well as orally by telephone. These changes will give sponsors additional time to gather appropriate data to help
interpret the reports before submitting these reports. FDA believes the extended time period would be sufficient
to alert the agency to potential safety problems, especially because of the new investigational reporting requirements
the agency is proposing. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Proposed &sect;312.32(c) would also permit sponsors to submit IND safety reports to the agency by using FDA Form 3500A.
If FDA determined that insufficient data were submitted on FDA Form 3500A, the agency could require additional narrative
data to be submitted. As explained elsewhere in this proposal, this amendment is consistent with the proposal to use
this form for postmarketing reporting of human drug and licensed biological product adverse experiences.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
FDA is also proposing to amend the disclaimer contained in &sect;312.32(e) to emphasize that safety information
submitted to FDA are not to be considered admissions of causation or liability. The proposal would substitute the
word ``part'' for ``section'' so that the revised disclaimer would clearly apply to all safety information submitted
under part 312. Summaries of such safety information would not constitute a statement or admission that there was
a causal link between the administration of the drug and the subsequent adverse event. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=81 g=1 f=1 -->
3. Semiannual Reports 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
FDA is proposing to amend the periodic reporting requirements in &sect;312.33 by adding, in addition to the annual
report, a semiannual death and serious adverse experiences report. This change is intended to ensure that reports
of deaths and other serious adverse experiences in all clinical studies are collected and reviewed in a timely and
comprehensive manner, and that the possibility of drug relatedness is always considered.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Under current regulations, sponsors must report deaths and serious and unexpected adverse experiences within 3
or 10 working days only if the events are associated with the use of the drug. ``Associated with the use of the drug''
is defined to mean that there is a reasonable possibility that the experience may have been caused by the drug (see &sect;312.32(a)).
Deaths and a summary of serious adverse experiences that occur in a clinical trial that the sponsor concludes are not
associated with use of the drug must be reported only in an IND annual report. The task force found that many adverse
experiences occurring during the FIAU study that appear, in retrospect, to have been drug related were not reported
in safety reports, although, at times, they were reported in the annual report as attributable to causes other than
FIAU. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The proposed rule, therefore, would create a new ``semiannual report'' to require, among other things, the submission
of reports of all deaths, serious adverse experiences, and study discontinuations resulting from an adverse experience,
whether expected or unexpected and whether or not there was thought to be a possibility that the death or adverse experience
was caused by the drug. In these twice yearly reports, sponsors would also report all deaths and serious adverse experiences
that occurred during the trial or within the prescribed followup period. The report would include data not only from
studies conducted under the IND, but also data from all premarketing studies of the drug conducted worldwide, with
an analysis of all unexpected deaths, serious adverse experiences, and study discontinuations thought to be related
to the study drug from foreign postmarketing clinical trials and from foreign postmarketing spontaneous or required
reporting systems. Serious adverse events should include laboratory changes that result in discontinuation or
that are identified in the study protocol as reportable events. Sponsors would present these data both for the 6-month
reporting interval and cumulatively, and submit an analysis of the data. The agency would expect the analysis to conform
generally to the evaluation of deaths, serious adverse experiences, and discontinuations in the section entitled
``Integrated Summary of Safety Information'' in FDA's ``Guideline for the Format and Content of the Clinical and
Statistical Sections of New Drug Applications.'' FDA also recommends that the sponsor employ, in preparing the analysis,
at least one individual who had no involvement in conducting the clinical study. The proposal would also require a
sponsor to conduct a ``worst-case'' analysis of the safety data, presuming that observed adverse events were the
result of toxicity from the investigational drug, and then attempt to refute this presumption, with appropriate
data and evaluations (task force report at 59). The analysis should include estimates of the rate of an analyzed event
occurring spontaneously in the population and specific analyses of cases.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The sponsor would submit the semiannual report for the 6-month period following the day the IND goes into effect, and
for each 6-month period thereafter, until the end of the followup period specified in the protocol. The report would
be due within 60 days of the end of the reporting period. The semiannual safety report that is due during the same period
as the annual report would be submitted with the annual report.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The task force recommended (task force report at 59) that FDA require the submission of all available autopsy reports
and medical reports concerning all deaths reported in these semiannual reports, because, in at least one instance
during the FIAU study, the cause of death originally reported was not fully consistent with the autopsy and terminal
medical reports later obtained for that subject. Proposed &sect;312.33(b)(2) would require the submission of these
reports and would require the sponsor to clarify any inconsistencies between these reports and the cause of death
reported to FDA by the sponsor. FDA is proposing this requirement to help ensure that reports covering deaths submitted
to the agency are complete and accurate. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Under proposed &sect;312.33(b)(3), at the request of the sponsor, or on its own initiative, FDA may modify certain
semiannual reporting requirements where, for example, the clinical study endpoint is mortality or where the study
is blinded and full compliance with the reporting requirement would require breaking the blind. FDA is proposing
this provision because studies vary concerning the nature and seriousness of the disease to be treated, the number
of subjects exposed to the drug, and the general pace at which the drug's development proceeds.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=81 g=1 f=1 -->
4. Special Safety Summary
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
In new &sect;312.37(a), FDA also proposes an additional mechanism to allow the agency to obtain safety data on investigational
drugs and summaries of these data not otherwise obtained through other reporting requirements if, and when, these
data are necessary. Most investigational drugs do not present unusual safety concerns, so that the safety data contained
in the 6-month and annual reports, as well as the IND safety reports submitted under &sect;312.32, would provide adequate
information to allow FDA to observe drug safety. Some drugs, however, may raise significant safety concerns either
anticipated or unanticipated, so that more comprehensive data on events that do not meet the definition of a serious
adverse reaction as well as those that do are needed. Events that might trigger this heightened scrutiny include agency
experience with similar drugs, animal toxicity study results, and information derived from IND safety, annual,
or semiannual reports. As recommended by the task force (task force report at 59 and 60), the proposed regulation is
drafted in general language to allow the agency, in consultation with the sponsor, flexibility in determining when
a report should be required and what information it should contain. This flexibility is considered necessary because
the specifics of the safety summary may vary from study to study. FDA anticipates that the safety summary will generally
not only contain the results of the cumulative analysis of deaths and serious adverse experiences contained in the
6-month report, but also an analysis of related events of lesser seriousness. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Although the task force recommended that FDA require safety summaries unless an exemption had been granted to the
sponsor, FDA is proposing to require safety summaries only for those studies or products where the agency has determined
that a specific need for them exists. FDA would generally expect safety summaries to be submitted within 30 days after
they are requested; however, the agency recognizes that in cases where large amounts of data are required to be summarized
and those data are not readily available or easily summarized, a longer period of time may be necessary to prepare the
summary.

5. Final Clinical Study Report 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Information about FIAU risks and benefits that the sponsor might have derived from the process of collecting and analyzing
study results was delayed or never developed because final reports were not required for the earlier clinical studies
of FIAU and FIAC (a closely related nucleoside analog). Thus, FDA is proposing in &sect;312.37(b) to require sponsors
to submit, when required by FDA, a final report or study summary of a clinical study. FDA anticipates that final reports
usually will not be necessary. Instituting requirements for semiannual reporting of deaths, serious adverse experiences,
and discontinuations, and for summarization of all safety data will largely fulfill the need for more careful monitoring
and analysis of potential drug toxicity during drug testing. In some cases, however, it may still be valuable to have
available an analysis of the results of particular trials; e.g., to provide data on the likely effectiveness of a drug
for purposes of weighing risks against likely benefits to study subjects. The proposal would
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
require final clinical study reports to be submitted within 90 days of a request from FDA, but provides for exceptions
under extraordinary circumstances. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=81 g=1 f=1 -->
6. Clinical Holds
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Section 312.42 currently allows FDA to delay a proposed clinical investigation or to suspend an ongoing investigation
under certain circumstances. Under the proposal, FDA would amend &sect;312.42 to allow the agency to place an investigation
on clinical hold if the sponsor fails to submit a special safety summary or final clinical study report. If the same
or a closely related drug is the subject of a concurrent investigation, conducted by the same sponsor, proposed &sect;312.42(b)(1)(v)
would require safety summaries from all investigations or the agency could place any of the investigations on clinical
hold. FDA believes this is appropriate because data from all studies involving the drug or closely related drugs may
help FDA evaluate the safety of each study.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=81 g=1 f=1 -->
7. Termination
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
FDA is also proposing in &sect;312.44(b)(1)(viii) to amend the regulations regarding termination so that failure
to submit a semiannual report would be grounds for terminating an IND. Failure to submit an annual report is already
grounds for terminating an IND, and FDA is aware of no reason why semiannual and annual reports should be treated differently
in this matter.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
FDA considers that failure to implement an adequate safety monitoring and evaluation program, as described in proposed
21 CFR 312.56(c), would be grounds for either a clinical hold under &sect;312.42 or a termination of the IND under &sect;312.44,
since failure to have a program in place would mean that ``[h]uman subjects are or would be exposed to an unreasonable
and significant risk of illness or injury,'' which is currently grounds for either a clinical hold or termination.

FDA is also proposing to amend &sect;312.64(b) to require investigators to submit safety data to sponsors necessary
to allow sponsors to comply with the other proposed safety reporting requirements, such as the proposed semiannual
report. The proposed amendment would require the investigator to comply with safety reporting requirements established
in the protocol for the study. Current &sect;312.64(b) requires investigators to report adverse effects if they
may reasonably be regarded as caused by, or probably caused by, the drug. If the adverse effects are alarming, they
are to be reported to the sponsor immediately. These provisions are being retained as minimal requirements which
must be met, even if the protocol does not require the events to be reported.

G. Written Procedures for Monitoring Adverse Experiences
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
FDA is also proposing to amend &sect;&sect;310.305(a) and 314.80(b) for marketed human drug products and &sect;600.80(b)
for licensed biological products to require applicants or manufacturers, packers, and distributors to develop
written procedures for the surveillance, receipt, evaluation, and reporting of adverse experiences to FDA. This
requirement would improve postmarketing surveillance by applicants or manufacturers and would enhance an applicant's
or manufacturer's ability to evaluate and report 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
adverse experiences to the agency. FDA believes that this provision would not impose a new burden on applicants and
manufacturers, because it codifies a practice that is already customary and usual in the pharmaceutical industry
for handling adverse experiences. Based on field inspections, FDA is aware that many manufacturers already have
written procedures for the receipt, evaluation, and reporting of adverse experiences to FDA. The agency also notes
that the current good manufacturing practice (CGMP) regulations for finished pharmaceuticals, which apply to manufacturers
of all marketed human drug and biological products, require written procedures describing the handling of all written
and oral complaints regarding a drug product (21 CFR 211.198). 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Furthermore, the agency's ``Guideline For Postmarketing Reporting of Adverse Drug Experiences'' (Ref. 4), which
provides guidance on adverse drug experiences reported under &sect;&sect;310.305 and 314.80, states (at page 17)
that: 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->
Each applicant should develop standardized, formal procedures for the surveillance, receipt, evaluation, and
reporting of ADE's to FDA. * * * All applicants should develop procedures that allow expedited adverse experience
report handling, and the applicant should keep on file documentation of due diligence.

 FDA is announcing the availability of a guideline entitled ``Guideline for Adverse Experience Reporting for Licensed
Biological Products.'' This guideline discusses the reports required by &sect;600.80 and provides guidance concerning
appropriate means of meeting the reporting requirements.

H. Resubmission of Reports Received From FDA
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Under the MedWatch program, FDA will transmit reports of spontaneously reported serious adverse experiences received
by the agency to the applicant, manufacturer, packer, or distributor (as appropriate) on an expedited basis. Consequently,
FDA is proposing to revise &sect;&sect;310.305(c), 314.80(b), and 600.80(b) to state that applicants or manufacturers,
packers, and distributors should not resubmit to the agency reports of adverse experiences that the agency has forwarded
to them. In addition, FDA is proposing to revise &sect;&sect;314.80(c)(1)(i) and 600.80(c)(1)(i) to remove the
phrase ``regardless of source'' from the description of which adverse experiences are reported to FDA. These revisions
are intended to reduce duplicate reporting of adverse experiences to the agency, consistent with the reporting instructions
in new FDA Form 3500A. FDA notes, however, that applicants or manufacturers, packers, and distributors receiving
reports forwarded to them by FDA are required to handle these reports as they would any others and that followup, if
obtained, is to be sent to the agency as specified in the regulation. These followup reports should be included, where
appropriate, in the postmarketing adverse experience periodic report.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
FDA is also proposing that applicants and licensed manufacturers incorporate into any safety analysis (i.e., periodic
reports, increased frequency reports) the expedited reports received from FDA, whether or not additional followup
information was obtained, and any information received through Freedom of Information requests.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 -->
I. Other Revisions to the Reporting Requirements
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
FDA is proposing to remove &sect;&sect;314.80(c)(2)(iii) and 600.80(c)(2)(iii). These paragraphs state that
periodic reporting for non-15-day Alert reports does not apply to adverse drug experience information obtained
from postmarketing studies and reports in the scientific literature and from foreign marketing experience. FDA
is proposing to remove these paragraphs because this information would now be required under the proposed revisions
to the contents of a periodic report.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Current regulations, at &sect;314.80(c)(1)(ii), require applicants and, at 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
&sect;600,80(c)(1)ii), licensed manufacturers to ``review periodically (at least as often as the periodic reporting
cycle)'' the frequency of reports of adverse experiences and report any significant increase in frequency to FDA.
Similarly, current &sect;310.305(c)(4) requires manufacturers, packers,and distributors to ``review periodically
(at least once each year)'' the frequency of reports of adverse experiences and report any significant increase in
frequency to FDA. In order to provide consistency with the proposed semiannual reporting requirements for periodic
adverse experience reports under &sect;&sect;314.80 and 600.80, FDA is proposing to amend &sect;310.305 to require
manufacturers, packers, and distributors to review periodically, at least twice each year, the frequency of adverse
experience reports for the purposes of making increased frequency reports to FDA.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
FDA is also proposing to amend &sect;&sect;310.305(c) and 314.80(c) by reorganizing, renumbering, and retitling
the paragraphs in these sections to distinguish between postmarketing 15&hyph;day Alert reports, followups to
postmarketing 15&hyph;day Alert reports, and increased frequency reports. The proposed amendments would also
distinguish between the reporting intervals for postmarketing 15&hyph;day Alert reports and the revised intervals
proposed for postmarketing periodic reports.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
FDA is also proposing to amend &sect;&sect;310.305(c)(1) through (c)(4) and 314.80(c)(1)(i), through (c)(1)(iv)
to alter the period for submitting postmarketing ``15&hyph;day'' Alert reports from 15 working days to 15 calendar
days. This change should decrease misunderstandings with the reporting requirements as all timeframes would now
be stated in terms of calendar days. In addition, this change would increase consistency between the premarketing
and postmarketing reporting requirements.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
FDA is also proposing to amend &sect;&sect;310.305(c)(2), 314.80(c)(1)(ii), and 600.80(c)(1)(ii) to require
applicants or manufacturers, packers, and distributors who have been unable to obtain additional information about
adverse experiences that are the subject of postmarketing 15-day Alert reports to maintain records of their attempts
to seek additional information. These proposed revisions will help ensure that applicants or manufacturers are
making good faith efforts to investigate adverse experiences that are the subject of postmarketing 15-day Alert
reports.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Finally, FDA is proposing to amend &sect;&sect;310.305(d)(3)(ii) and 314.80(f)(3)(ii) to instruct applicants
or manufacturers, packers, and distributors that, before using an alternative reporting form instead of FDA Form
3500A, they must obtain approval from MedWatch: The FDA Medical Products Reporting Program, 5600 Fishers Lane, Rockville,
MD 20852&hyph;9787. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Current regulations require prior approval from the Division of Epidemiology and Surveillance for human drug products.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 -->
J. Distribution Reports
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
As stated earlier, the proposed rule would change the reporting interval for licensed biological product distribution
reports to be consistent with the suggested CIOMS standardized reporting period for postmarketing adverse drug
experience periodic reports. Licensed biological product distribution reports would be based on the international
birth date and data lock-point. The proposal would also remove &sect;600.81 and move the regulatory requirements
for licensed biological product distribution reports to &sect;600.80(c)(3).
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 -->
K. Multiple Reports
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
FDA is proposing to amend &sect;600.80(g) concerning multiple reports by adding information pertaining to a licensed
biological product for which a licensed manufacturer holds more than one biological product license. This revision
would be consistent with the requirements in &sect;314.80(g).
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 -->
L. Guidelines
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
FDA is proposing to amend &sect;&sect;314.80(j) and 600.80(j) to indicate where guidelines for the submission of
adverse experience reports may be obtained. In addition, FDA is adding this information in &sect;310.305(g) for
the submission of adverse experience reports for prescription drugs without an approved application. For human
drug products, the guidelines may be obtained from the CDER Executive Secretariat Staff (HFD&hyph;8), Center for
Drug Evaluation and Research, Food and Drug Administration, 7500 Standish Pl., Rockville, MD 20855, and for licensed
biological products from the Congressional and Consumer Affairs Branch (HFM&hyph;12), Center for Biologics Evaluation
and Research, Food and Drug Administration, 1401 Rockville Pike, suite 200N, Rockville, MD 20852&hyph;1448.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 -->
M. Proposed Implementation Scheme
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
FDA proposes that any final rule that may issue based on this proposal become effective 30 days after its date of publication
in the 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 -->
Federal Register
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
. All applications for human drug or licensed biological products approved on or after the effective date of any final
regulation would be subject to the periodic reporting time periods based on the international birth date. All human
drug and licensed biological product applications approved before the effective date of any final regulation would
use the U.S. approval date as the international birth date.

The agency has determined under 21 CFR 25.24(a)(8) that this action is of a type that does not individually or cumulatively
have a significant effect on the human environment. Therefore, neither an environmental assessment nor an environmental
impact statement is required.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
FDA has examined the impacts of the proposed rule under Executive Order 12866 and the Regulatory Flexibility Act (Pub.
L. 96&hyph;354). Executive Order 12866 directs agencies to assess all costs and benefits of available regulatory
alternatives and, when regulation is necessary, to select regulatory approaches that maximize net benefits (including
potential economic, environmental, public health and safety, and other advantages; distributive impacts; and
equity). The agency believes that this proposed rule is consistent with the regulatory philosophy and principles
identified in the Executive Order. In addition, the proposed rule is not a significant regulatory action as defined
by the Executive Order and so is not subject to review under the Executive Order.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The economic costs imposed on the industry as a result of this proposed rule are the costs associated with reporting
deaths, serious adverse experiences, or clinical study discontinuations. Reporting burdens on the industry resulting
from FDA regulations are analyzed under the Paperwork Reduction Act of 1980. Based on an estimated total of 480,602
annual burden hours, FDA has estimated that the total annual reporting cost to the industry as a result of this proposed
rule would be $ 24,030,100 (the estimated per hour cost to the industry is $ 50). In addition, the rule may increase certain
nonpaperwork activities. For example, added costs may result if the formal control groups suggested in &sect;312.23(a)(6)(iii)(i)
prompts additional clinical trial control arms, or if the implementation of the followup plan required in &sect;312.23(a)(6)(iii)(k)
provokes more elaborate monitoring procedures. At this time, FDA cannot predict the extent of these actions, but
welcomes public comment on issues regarding the scope or cost of these activities. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Regulatory Flexibility Act requires agencies to analyze regulatory options that would minimize any significant
impact of a rule on small entities. The agency certifies that the proposed rule will not have a significant economic
impact on a substantial number of small entities. Therefore, under the Regulatory Flexibility Act, no further analysis
is required.

VI. Paperwork Reduction Act of 1980
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
This proposed rule contains information collection requirements which are subject to review by the Office of Management
and Budget (OMB) under the Paperwork Reduction Act of 1980. The title, description, and respondents of the information
collection requirements are shown below.

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Description
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
: FDA is proposing to amend its current adverse experience reporting requirements to replace current Form FDA&hyph;1639
with new FDA Form 3500A; to revise certain definitions and reporting periods and formats; to require applicants or
manufacturers, packers, and distributors to develop written procedures for monitoring and reporting adverse experiences;
and to make other revisions to provide uniformity to the reporting regulations. These changes would simplify and
facilitate the reporting of adverse events and product problems under a single form and help harmonize international
adverse event reporting requirements. In addition, FDA is proposing to amend the sponsor reporting requirements
in part 312. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Description of Respondents
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
: Businesses or other for profit and small businesses or organizations. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The burden hours for &sect;&sect;310.305 and 314.80 are approved under OMB information collection number 0910&hyph;0230.
The burden hours for &sect;600.80 have been submitted to OMB for approval and can be found elsewhere in this issue of
the 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 -->
Federal Register
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
. FDA estimates no change in the burden hours that have already been approved. OMB has approved use of the new form, under
OMB information collection number 0910&hyph;0291, through December 1994. The new recordkeeping requirements
under &sect;310.305(c)(2), 314.80(c)(1)(ii), and 600.80(c)(1)(ii), that applicants or manufacturers, packers,
and distributors maintain records of unsuccessful attempts to obtain additional followup information on 15-day
``Alert reports,'' would be negligible and would result in no change in the burden hours that have already been approved.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The new requirements under &sect;&sect;310.305(a), 314.80(b), and 600.80(b), that applicants or manufacturers,
packers, and distributors develop written procedures for the surveillance, receipt, evaluation, and reporting
of adverse experiences, would not impose a new burden because they codify a practice that is already customary and
usual in the pharmaceutical industry for handling adverse experiences.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The more extensive list of contents for the periodic postmarketing adverse experience report, in proposed &sect;&sect;314.80(c)(2)(ii)
and 600.80(c)(2)(ii), would result in an increased reporting burden on the industry. As indicated in the accompanying
chart, the proposed periodic reporting requirements would require, on an average, 19 additional hours for respondents
to prepare.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The proposal would also increase the reporting requirements for sponsors under part 312. As indicated in the accompanying
chart, the proposed amendments to part 312 would result in an increase of 167,900 burden hours on the industry.

Definitions
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
. The following definitions of terms apply to this section:
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(1) 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
FDA
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 means the Food and Drug Administration.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(2) 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Adverse drug experience
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 means any adverse event associated with the use of a drug in humans, whether or not considered drug related, including
the following: An adverse event occurring in the course of the use of a drug product in professional practice; an adverse
event occurring from drug overdose; an adverse event occurring from drug withdrawal; and any failure of expected
pharmacological action.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(3) 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Disability
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 means a substantial disruption of a person's ability to carry out normal life functions.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(4) 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Increased frequency
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 means an increase in the rate of occurrence of a particular adverse drug experience, e.g., an increased number of reports
of particular adverse drug experience after appropriate adjustment for drug exposure.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(5) 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Life-threatening
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 means that the patient was, in the view of the initial reporter, at immediate risk of death from the adverse drug experience
as it occurred. It does not include an adverse drug experience that, had it occurred in a more serious form, might have
caused death. For example, product-induced hepatitis that resolved without evidence of hepatic failure would not
be considered life-threatening even though hepatitis of a more severe nature can be fatal. Similarly, an allergic
reaction resulting in angioedema of the face would not be life-threatening, although angioedema of the larynx, allergic
bronchospasm, or anaphylaxis can be fatal.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(6) 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Serious
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 means an adverse drug experience occurring at any dose that is fatal or life-threatening, results in persistent or
significant disability/incapacity, requires or prolongs inpatient hospitalization, necessitates medical or
surgical intervention to preclude permanent impairment of a body function or permanent damage to a body structure,
or is a congenital anomaly.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(7) 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Unexpected
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 means an adverse drug experience that is not listed in the current labeling for the drug product and includes an event
that may be symptomatically and pathophysiologically related to an event listed in the labeling, but differs from
the event because of greater severity or specificity. For example, under this definition, hepatic necrosis would
be unexpected (by virtue of greater severity) if the labeling only referred to elevated hepatitic enzymes or hepatitis.
Similarly, cerebral thromboembolism and cerebral vasculitis would be unexpected (by virtue of greater specificity)
if the labeling only listed cerebral vascular accidents.

(c) 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Reporting requirements
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
. Each person identified in paragraph (c)(1) of this section shall report to FDA adverse drug experience information
as described in this section and shall submit one copy of each report to the Division of Epidemiology and Surveillance
(HFD&hyph;730), Center for Drug Evaluation and Research, Food and Drug Administration, 5600 Fishers Lane, Rockville,
MD 20857.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Postmarketing 15&hyph;Day ``Alert reports''
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
. (i) Any person whose name appears on the label of a marketed prescription drug product as its manufacturer, packer,
or distributor shall report to FDA each adverse drug experience received or otherwise obtained that is both serious
and unexpected as soon as possible, but in any case, within 15 calendar days of initial receipt of the information.
Each report shall be accompanied by a copy of the current labeling for the drug product.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(ii) A person identified in paragraph (c)(1)(i) of this section is not required to submit a 15-day ``Alert report''
for an adverse drug experience obtained from a postmarketing study (whether or not conducted under an investigational
new drug application) unless the applicant concludes that there is a reasonable possibility that the drug caused
the adverse experience.

(2) 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Postmarketing 15&hyph;Day ``Alert reports''_followup
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
. Each person identified in paragraph (c)(1)(i) of this section shall promptly investigate all serious, unexpected
adverse drug experiences that are the subject of these 15-day postmarketing Alert reports and shall submit followup
reports within 15 calendar days of receipt of new information or as requested by FDA. If additional information is
not obtainable, records should be maintained of the unsuccessful steps taken to seek additional information.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(3) 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Increased frequency report
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
. Each person identified in paragraph (c)(1)(i) of this section shall review periodically (at least twice each year)
the frequency of reports of adverse drug experiences that are both serious and expected and reports of therapeutic
failure (lack of effect), received or otherwise obtained, and report any significant increase in frequency as soon
as possible, but in any case within 15 calendar days of determining that a significant increase in frequency exists.
Reports of a significant increase in frequency are required to be submitted in narrative form (including the time
period on which the increased frequency is based, the method of analysis, and the interpretation of the results) rather
than using FDA Form 3500A.

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Submission of reports
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
. In order to avoid unnecessary duplication in the submission of, and followup to, reports required in this section,
including reports required by paragraph (c)(3) of this section, a packer's or distributor's obligations may be met
by submission of all reports of serious adverse drug experiences to the manufacturer of the drug product. If a packer
or distributor elects to submit these adverse drug experience reports to the manufacturer rather than to FDA, it shall
submit each report to the manufacturer within 3 calendar days of its receipt by the packer or distributor, and the manufacturer
shall then comply with the requirements of this section even if its name does not appear on the label of the drug product.
Under this circumstance, the packer or distributor shall maintain a record of this action which shall include:
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(i) A copy of each drug experience report.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(ii) Date the report was received by the packer or distributor.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(iii) Date the report was submitted to the manufacturer.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(iv) Name and address of the manufacturer. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(5) Each report submitted to FDA under this section shall bear prominent identification as to its contents, i.e.,
``15-day Alert report,'' ``15-day Alert report_followup,'' or ``Increased frequency report.''
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(6) A person identified in paragraph (c)(1)(i) of this section should not resubmit to FDA reports forwarded to that
person by FDA; however, all followup information must be submitted to FDA.

to the sponsor immediately. This would ordinarily include any death, any life-threatening event, any serious event
that might reflect potential toxicity, as suggested by preclinical data, laboratory values that exceed specified
limits, or any markedly abnormal laboratory value. The identified events and abnormal laboratory values are to include
those that focus attention on toxicity that may target the same organs and body systems as the underlying disease or
concomitant medications for the disease. The events are to be reported to the sponsor even if they are potentially
attributable to the patient's underlying disease or to other medications the patient may have received. This section
of the protocol shall include instructions for the investigator encountering such an event, such as reporting requirements,
a remeasurement or challenge procedure, or discontinuation of the study drug.

(
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

that may arise from the underlying disease or from medications used to treat the underlying disease. Deaths or serious
adverse experiences that exceed these estimates would create a presumption that the events are associated with the
use of the investigational drug.

procedures based on preclinical data, experience with other members of the drug class, the drug's mechanism of action,
and prior human experience. The sponsor shall include a brief description of the rationale used in selecting the followup
period and procedures. The intensity of the followup may change with time; e.g., a full evaluation might be scheduled
for 2 weeks after the end of drug dosing, with a telephone followup at a later time. Ordinarily, in Phase 1 and 2 studies,
there should be at least telephone followup for 3 months after drug dosing is completed, but alternative timeframes
and procedures can be proposed by the sponsor. In some cases, available information may dictate followup periods
longer than 3 months.

period specified in the protocol. The report shall be due within 60 days of the end of the reporting period. The semiannual
safety report that is due during the same period as the annual report required under paragraph (a) of this section shall
be submitted with the annual report. These semiannual reports shall include: 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(1) A summary and analysis of all deaths, all serious adverse experiences, and all study discontinuations resulting
from an adverse experience that occurred during the study or within the prescribed followup period, whether the deaths
or adverse experiences were expected or unexpected and whether or not there is thought to be a possibility that the
death or adverse experience or study discontinuation was caused by the drug. This summary shall include data not only
from studies conducted under the IND, but also data from all premarketing studies of the drug conducted worldwide,
with an analysis of all unexpected deaths, serious adverse experiences, and study discontinuations thought to be
related to the study drug from foreign postmarketing clinical trials and from foreign postmarketing spontaneous
or required reporting systems. For purposes of this section, serious adverse events shall include laboratory changes
identified in the study protocol as reportable events or that result in discontinuation. The sponsor shall present
in the summary both the data that accumulated during the reporting period and cumulatively. The sponsor shall also
submit an analysis of the data that assumes that the investigational drug is responsible for the deaths, serious adverse
experiences, and study discontinuations, and refute, as feasible, this presumption with appropriate data and evaluations.
The expected incidence of deaths and serious adverse experiences in the study population that may arise from the underlying
disease or from medications used to treat the underlying disease that was estimated in the protocol should be considered
in this evaluation. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(2) All available autopsy reports and terminal medical reports concerning all deaths reported in this summary, with
a discussion of any inconsistencies between autopsy and medical reports and the cause of death reported to FDA by the
sponsor. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(3) At the request of the sponsor, or on its own initiative, FDA may modify the requirements of paragraph (b) of this
section. A sponsor requesting such a modification should submit to the division responsible for review of the IND
a written request for modification and justification for such modification. FDA shall issue a written response to
the sponsor either granting or denying, in whole or in part, the request for modification.

of adverse drug experiences that are both serious and expected and reports of therapeutic failure (lack of effect),
regardless of source, and report any significant increase in frequency as soon as possible but in any case within 15
calendar days of determining that a significant increase in frequency exists. Upon written notice, FDA may require
that applicants review the frequency of reports of serious, expected adverse drug experiences at intervals different
than the periodic reporting cycle. Reports of a significant increase in frequency are required to be submitted in
narrative form (including the time period on which the increased frequency is based, the method of analysis, and the
interpretation of the results), rather than using FDA Form 3500A. 15-day Alert reports based on increased frequency

duplication in the submission to FDA of reports required by paragraphs (c)(1)(i), (c)(1)(ii), and (c)(1)(iii) of
this section, obligations of a nonapplicant may be met by submission of all reports of serious adverse drug experiences
to the applicant. If a nonapplicant elects to submit adverse drug experience reports to the applicant rather than
to FDA, it shall submit each report to the applicant within 3 calendar days of its receipt by the nonapplicant, and the
applicant shall then comply with the requirements of this section. Under this circumstance, the nonapplicant shall
maintain a record of this action which shall include:

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
. (i) The applicant shall report every 6 months each adverse drug experience not reported under paragraphs (c)(1)(i)
and (c)(1)(ii) of this section. The periodic reporting term shall be based upon the international birth date of the
human drug product. The first 6-month anniversary of the international birth date after the application is approved
in the United States is the data lock-point for the first periodic reporting term. Each subsequent 6-month anniversary
of the international birth date is the data lock-point for subsequent periodic reporting terms for that particular
product. Periodic reports shall be submitted to FDA within 45 days after the data lock-point. Upon written notice,
FDA may require that the applicant submit reports under this section at times other than those stated. An applicant
who wishes to submit periodic reports at different intervals must submit to FDA a request for a waiver under &sect;314.90.
Followup information to adverse drug experiences submitted initially in a periodic report may be submitted in the
next periodic report. If the applicant does not receive any adverse experience reports during the reporting period,
the applicant shall, in place of a periodic report, send a copy of the current approved U.S. labeling and a letter identifying
the product, the application number, and the reporting period, stating that no adverse drug experience reports were
received.

Reports
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
. Each periodic report shall contain:
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(A) 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Title page, table of contents, and introduction
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
. The introduction shall be a summary of the periodic report with page references to detailed data and information.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(B) 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Applicant's core safety data sheet
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
. The applicant's core safety data sheet shall be a document prepared by the applicant that contains all relevant safety
information, including adverse drug experiences, which the applicant believes should be listed for the drug in all
countries where the drug is marketed. It may be used by the applicant as the reference document by which an adverse drug
experience is judged to be expected or unexpected for purposes of this postmarketing periodic report. For all other
determinations of whether an adverse drug experience is expected or unexpected, the definition in paragraph (a)
of this section shall apply.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
1
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
) FDA recognizes that the postmarketing periodic report may be submitted by the applicant to multiple countries and
the product may have different approved labels in the different countries. The use of the applicant's core safety
data sheet as the reference document for determining whether an adverse drug experience is unexpected or not may result
in some overreporting of unexpected adverse events that actually are expected by the U.S. approved product label.
This is because the approved label for the United States may have more safety information included in it than the manufacturer's
core safety data sheet. If an adverse event is not listed in the U.S. label, but is in the manufacturer's core safety
data sheet, this shall be clearly noted in the ``Overall safety evaluation'' (see paragraph (c)(2) (ii)(H) of this
section). This section also shall highlight clearly any changes and the reasons for the changes in the applicant's
core safety data sheet since the previous postmarketing periodic report.

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
) An applicant may also use the approved U.S. label as the reference by which expected and unexpected adverse drug experiences
are determined for the postmarketing periodic report. If an applicant chooses to use the approved U.S. label for this
purpose, it shall clearly be stated in this section of the report. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(C) 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
The product's marketing status
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
. This section shall contain a table containing a chronological history of the marketing status of the product worldwide
(all regulatory decisions affecting the product and all market launches) from the date it was first approved through
its current status. Approvals or applications voluntarily withdrawn for safety reasons shall be included at a minimum.
The product shall be listed by chemical (or proper name) and brand name(s).
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(D) 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Regulatory actions for safety reasons
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
. This section shall contain a narrative identifying the reasons for significant regulatory authority or manufacturer-initiated
actions taken anywhere in the world, or to be taken imminently, for safety reasons during the reporting period. This
includes, for example, application withdrawal or license suspension or failure to renew, distribution restrictions,
clinical trial suspension, labeling changes due to significant safety concerns, dosage modifications, or pharmaceutical
changes.

(E) 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Patient exposure
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
. This section shall include the product's domestic and foreign marketing distribution data during the reporting
period. This shall be used to calculate the extent of patient exposure. The method used by the manufacturer to estimate
patient exposure shall always be described and shall include the total number of dosage units of each dosage form and
strength or potency (e.g., 100,000/5-milligram tablets, 50,000/10-milliliter vials).

Life-threatening
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 means that the patient was, in the view of the initial reporter, at immediate risk of death from the adverse experience
as it occurred. It does not include an adverse experience that, had it occurred in a more serious form, might have caused
death. For example, product-induced hepatitis that resolved without evidence of hepatic failure would not be considered
life-threatening even though hepatitis of a more severe nature can be fatal. Similarly, an allergic reaction resulting
in angioedema of the face would not be life-threatening, even though angioedema of the larynx, allergic bronchospasm,
or anaphylaxis can be fatal.

licensed manufacturer shall submit two copies of each report described in this section for nonvaccine biological
products to the Center for Biologics Evaluation and Research (HFM&hyph;210), Food and Drug Administration, 1401
Rockville Pike, suite 200N, Rockville, MD 20852&hyph;1448. Submit all 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
vaccine adverse experience reports to: Vaccine Adverse Event Reporting System (VAERS), P.O. Box 1100, Rockville,

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Postmarketing 15-day ``Alert reports''
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
. The licensed manufacturer shall report each adverse experience that is both serious and unexpected as soon as possible,
but in any case within 15 calendar days of initial receipt of the information. These reports shall be submitted for
nonvaccine biological products on FDA Form 3500A, and, for vaccines, on a VAERS form.

. The licensed manufacturer shall promptly investigate all adverse experiences that are the subject of these postmarketing
15-day Alert reports and shall submit followup reports within 15 calendar days of receipt of new information or as
requested by FDA. If additional information is not obtainable, records should be maintained of the unsuccessful
steps taken to seek additional information. These postmarketing 15-day Alert reports and followups to them shall
be submitted under separate cover and may not be included, except for summary or tabular purposes, in a postmarketing
adverse experience periodic report.

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Increased frequency report
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
. The licensed manufacturer shall review periodically (at least as often as the periodic reporting cycle) the frequency
of reports of adverse biological product experiences that are both serious and expected and reports of therapeutic
failure (lack of effect), regardless of source, and report any significant increase in frequency as soon as possible
but in any case within 15 calendar days of determining that a significant increase in frequency exists. Upon written
notice, FDA may require that licensed manufacturers review the frequency of reports of serious, expected adverse
biological experiences at intervals different than the periodic reporting cycle. Reports of a significant increase
in frequency are required to be submitted in narrative form (including the time period on which the increased frequency
is based, the method of analysis, and the interpretation of the results), rather than using the form designated by
FDA. 15-day Alert reports based on increased frequency are required to be submitted under separate cover and may not
be included, except for summary purposes, in a periodic report.

(iv) 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Submission of reports
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
. The requirements of paragraphs (c)(1)(i), (c)(1)(ii), and (c)(i)(iii) of this section, concerning the submission
of postmarketing 15-day Alert reports, shall also apply to any person (other than the licensed manufacturer of the
final product) whose name appears on the label of a licensed biological product as a manufacturer, packer, distributor,
shared manufacturer, joint manufacturer, or any other participant involved in divided manufacturing. However,
in order to avoid unnecessary duplication in the submission to FDA of reports required by paragraphs (c)(1)(i), (c)(1)(ii),
and (c)(1)(iii) of this section, obligations of a manufacturer other than the licensed manufacturer, including
a licensed manufacturer of the product other than in its final form, may be met by submission of all reports of serious
adverse experiences to the licensed manufacturer of the final product. If a manufacturer, other than the licensed
manufacturer, elects to submit reports to the licensed manufacturer rather than to FDA, it shall submit each report
to the licensed manufacturer within 3 calendar days of its receipt, and the licensed manufacturer shall then comply
with the requirements of this section. Under this circumstance, the manufacturer shall maintain a record of this
action which shall include:
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(A) A copy of all adverse biological product experience reports submitted to the licensed manufacturer.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(B) Date the report was received by the manufacturer other than the licensed manufacturer.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(C) Date the report was submitted to the licensed manufacturer.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Report identification
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
. Each report submitted under this paragraph shall bear prominent identification as to its contents, i.e., ``15-day
Alert report,'' ``15-day Alert report_followup,'' or ``Increased frequency report.''
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Periodic adverse experience reports
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
. The licensed manufacturer shall report every 6 months each adverse experience not reported under paragraphs (c)(1)(i)
and (c)(1)(ii) of this section. The periodic reporting term shall be based upon the international birth date of the
biological product. The first 6-month anniversary of the international birth date after the application is approved
in the United States is the data lock- point for the first periodic reporting term. Each subsequent 6-month anniversary
of the international birth date is the data lock-point for subsequent periodic reporting terms for that particular
product. Periodic reports shall be submitted to FDA within 45 days after the data lock-point. Upon written notice,
FDA may require that the licensed manufacturer submit reports under this section at times other than those stated.
A licensed manufacturer who wishes to submit periodic reports at different intervals must submit to FDA a request
for a waiver under &sect;600.90. Followup information to adverse experiences submitted in a periodic report may
be submitted in the next periodic report. If the licensed manufacturer does not receive any adverse experience reports
during the reporting period, the licensed manufacturer shall, in place of a periodic report, send a copy of the current
approved U.S. labeling and a letter identifying the product, the application number, and the reporting period, stating
that no adverse experience reports were received.

. The licensed manufacturer's core safety data sheet shall be a document prepared by the licensed manufacturer that
contains all relevant safety information, including adverse experiences, which the licensed manufacturer believes
should be listed for the licensed biological product in all countries where the licensed biological product is marketed.
It may be used by the licensed manufacturer as the reference document by which an adverse experience is judged to be
expected or unexpected for purposes of this postmarketing periodic report. For all other determinations of whether
an adverse experience is expected or unexpected, the definition in paragraph (a) of this section shall apply.

) FDA recognizes that the postmarketing periodic report may be submitted by the licensed manufacturer to multiple
countries and the product may have different approved labels in the different countries. The use of the licensed manufacturer's
core safety data sheet as the reference document for determining whether an adverse drug experience is unexpected
or not may result in some overreporting of unexpected adverse events that actually are expected by the U.S. approved
product label. This is because the approved label for the United States may have more safety information included
in it than the licensed manufacturer's core safety data sheet. If an adverse event is not listed in the U.S. label, but
is in the licensed manufacturer's core safety data sheet, this shall be clearly noted in the ``Overall safety evaluation''
(see paragraph (c)(2)(ii)(H) of this section). This section also shall highlight clearly any changes and the reasons
for the changes in the licensed manufacturer's core safety data sheet since the previous postmarketing periodic
report.

) A licensed manufacturer may also use the approved U.S. label as the reference by which expected and unexpected adverse
experiences are determined for the postmarketing periodic report. If a licensed manufacturer chooses to use the
approved U.S. label for this purpose, it shall clearly be stated in this section of the report.

actions taken anywhere in the world, or to be taken imminently, for safety reasons during the reporting period. This
includes, for example, licensed application withdrawal or license suspension or failure to renew, distribution
restrictions, clinical trial suspension, labeling changes due to significant safety concerns, dosage modifications,
or pharmaceutical changes.

dose, duration of treatment (prior to event), time to onset, description of reaction (as reported), outcome (e.g.,
fatal, resolved), other comments (e.g., manufacturer's report number). This format is consistent with that suggested
by CIOMS. In addition, a tabular summary of the number of adverse events by body system may be included. This section
shall end with an analysis by the reporter, in narrative form, of the cases submitted. The licensed manufacturer shall
also attach to the end of the postmarketing periodic report a completed FDA Form 3500A or VAERS form for all U.S. spontaneous
reports of adverse experiences except those reported under paragraphs (c)(1)(i) and (c)(1)(ii) of this section,
or those sent by FDA to the licensed manufacturer.

Distribution reports
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
. The licensed manufacturer shall submit information about the quantity of the product distributed under the product
license, including the quantity distributed to distributors. The interval between distribution reports shall
be 6 months. The reporting term shall be based upon the international birth date of the biological product. The first
6-month anniversary of the international birth date after the application is approved in the United States is the
data lock-point for the first reporting term. Each subsequent 6-month anniversary of the international birth date
is the data lock-point for subsequent reporting terms for that particular product. Distribution reports shall be
submitted to FDA within 45 calendar days after the data lock-point. Upon written notice, FDA may require that the licensed
manufacturer submit distribution reports under this section at times other than every 6 months. The distribution
report shall consist of the bulk lot number (from which the final container was filled), the fill lot numbers for the
total number of dosage units of each strength or potency distributed (e.g., 50,000/10-milliliter vials), the label
lot number (if different from fill lot number), labeled date of expiration, number of doses in fill lot/label lot,
date of release of fill lot/label lot released for distribution at that time. If any significant amount of a fill lot/label
lot is returned, include this information. Disclosure of financial or pricing data is not required. As needed, FDA
may require submission of more detailed product distribution information. Upon written notice, FDA may require
that the licensed manufacturer submit reports under this section at times other than those stated. A licensed manufacturer
that wishes to submit reports at times other than those stated should submit a request for a waiver under &sect;600.90.
