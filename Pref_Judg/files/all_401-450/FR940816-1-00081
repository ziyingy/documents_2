The Service, or States and Tribes if authorized, may move wolves that are having unacceptable impacts on ungulate
populations in the unlikely event that those impacts would inhibit wolf recovery. Wolves could be moved to other places
within the experimental population area. Two examples are where wolf predation is dramatically affecting prey availability
because of unusual habitat or weather conditions (e.g., bighorn sheep in areas with marginal escape habitat) or where
wolves cause prey to move onto private property and mix with livestock, increasing potential conflicts. The States
and Tribes will define such unacceptable impacts, how they would be measured, and identify other possible mitigation
in their State or Tribal management plans. These plans would be approved by the Service through cooperative agreement
before such control could be conducted. Wolves would not be deliberately killed to resolve ungulate-wolf conflicts.
These unacceptable impacts would be identified in State and Tribal wolf management plans and developed in consultation
with the Service. If such control by the States or Tribes were likely to be significant or beyond the provisions of the
experimental rule as determined by the Service, then they would be specifically incorporated as part of an amendment
to this experimental rule, which would include national public comment and review.

Management of wolves in the experimental population would not result in any major change in existing private or public
land-use restrictions after 6 breeding pairs of wolves are established in this experimental area. When 5 or fewer
breeding pairs are in this experimental area, land-use restrictions could be employed on an as needed basis, at the
discretion of land management and natural resources agencies to control intrusive human disturbance. Temporary
restrictions on human access, when 5 or fewer breeding pairs are established, may be required near active wolf den
sites between April 1 and June 30.

The Service, or Federal, State or Tribal agencies authorized by the Service would be allowed to promptly remove any
wolf of the experimental population that the Service, or agency authorized by the Service, determined was presenting
a threat to human life or safety. Although not a management option

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 it is noted that a person could legally kill or injure wolves in response to an immediate threat to human life. The incidental
and accidental nonnegligent take in the course of otherwise lawful recreational activity or take in defense of human
life, would be permitted by the Service and Service-authorized agencies, provided that such taking is immediately
(within 24 hours) reported to the authorized State or Federal authority.

The Service or State, Federal, or Tribal agencies designated by the Service will control wolves that attack livestock
(cattle, sheep, horses, and mules) by management measures that may include aversive conditioning, nonlethal control,
and/or moving wolves when 5 or fewer breeding pairs are established, and by previously described measures. However,
killing wolves or placing them in captivity may be considered and used as management options after 6 or more breeding
pairs are established in the experimental population area. For depredation occurring on public land and prior to
6 breeding pairs becoming established, depredating females and their pups would be released on site prior to October
1. Wolves on private land under these circumstances would be moved. Wolves that attack other domestic animals and
pets on private land 2 times in a calendar year would be moved. Chronic problem wolves (wolves that depredate on domestic
animals after being moved for previous domestic animal depredations) would be removed from the wild.

The Service, other Federal agencies, and Tribal and State wildlife agency personnel would be additionally authorized
and should be prepared to take wolves under special circumstances where there was an immediate threat to livestock
or property, or need to move individuals for genetic purposes. Wolves could be captured alive and translocated to
resolve demonstrated conflicts with State big-game management objectives or when they were outside designated
wolf pack recovery areas. Take procedures in such instances would involve live capture and removal to a remote area,
or if the animal is clearly unfit to remain in the wild, return to a captive facility. Killing of animals would be a last
resort and would be authorized only if live capture attempts fail or there is some clear danger to human life.

The Service and other authorized management agencies would use the following conditions and criteria in determining
the problem status of wolves within the nonessential experimental population area:
