THE Bangladesh government estimates it will need Dollars 1.5bn (Pounds 800m)
in aid and 2m tonnes of rice in coming months to rescue the victims of last
month's cyclone and to rebuild the battered economy.
Storms and floods continue to ravage the country. Voluntary agencies said
that diarrhoea had broken out in 16 coastal districts where people were
drinking contaminated water.
The immediate need is said to be about Dollars 600m. So far about Dollars
450m has been pledged, but no funds had been disbursed by yesterday. Relief
operations, however, are moving more smoothly after 12 days of near
confusion.
Apart from the efforts by the army, which is the main agency in the country
providing food, water and medical supplies to about 10m survivors in the
coastal areas and islands, international aid has finally started flowing in.
About a dozen aircraft carrying medicines and other relief material landed
yesterday in Dhaka, the capital, and this pace is expected to be maintained
in the next few days.
Ships carrying food from Australia and Canada have anchored off Chittagong.
The logistics of delivering the supplies to the survivors are still to be
improved, but more helicopters have arrived from India and Thailand.
Differences between the acting president, Mr Justice Shahabuddin Ahmed, and
the prime minister, Mrs Khaleda Zia, are said to have been resolved and Mrs
Zia has taken over the relief co-ordination committee from him.
