  [Text] The mujahidin of our Islamic revolution staged a 
lightning attack on the Saddamist intelligence services' post 
near the bridge leading to the Umm al-Ni'aj marshland. The post 
was destroyed and seven of the regime's henchmen were killed in 
this heroic attack. The mujahidin seized a quantity of 
ammunition and light weapons and returned safely to base.
