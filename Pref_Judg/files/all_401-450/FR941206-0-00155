The implementation of air standards under RCRA does not create difficulties in administration and enforcement of
the rules by State regulatory agencies. Although many existing RCRA standards focus on preventing the contamination
of soil and water, other existing RCRA regulations regulate air emissions from some TSDF sources (e.g., combustion
of hazardous waste is regulated under 40 CFR part 264, subpart O for hazardous waste incinerators and under 40 CFR part
266 subpart H for boilers and industrial furnaces). Air emissions are also sometimes addressed through the EPA's
omnibus permitting authority under RCRA section 3005(c)(3). States authorized by the EPA administer and enforce
the requirements of RCRA rules in lieu of the EPA administering the rules in that State. The EPA is aware that, in many
States, one State agency administers air standards while another State agency administers rules regulating the
management of hazardous waste in the State. Similarly, it is common for yet another State agency to administer water
quality rules. The experience of authorized States administrating existing RCRA rules shows that responsibility
for administrating these rules can be delegated to a separate State agency without impeding the administration and
enforcement of non-RCRA air and water rules by other State agencies.

The commenter on the Notice of Data Availability (NDA) (57 FR 43171, September 18, 1992) supports the EPA's use of the
updated waste data base for the national impacts analysis and the EPA's changes to the emission models for biological
treatment processes. In addition, the commenter agrees with the EPA's conclusion that many surface impoundments
reported in the waste data base to be managing waste at TSDF have been or are being replaced with tanks to comply with
the RCRA land disposal restriction and other regulations. However, the commenter believes that the EPA's assumption
that 75 percent of the total waste quantity reported in the waste data base to be managed in surface impoundments is
now managed in tanks is too low. The commenter agrees with the EPA's revised approach in the impact analysis of using
site-specific cancer risk factors to estimate cancer risk due to exposure to TSDF emissions. However, the commenter
states that some of the specific assumptions made by the EPA for the risk analysis are implausible (e.g., assuming
exposure of the individual for 70 years) and the analysis should be conducted in accordance with the EPA's own Exposure
Assessment Guidelines. Finally, the commenter does not believe that any MIR estimate is necessary to assess the need
for and effectiveness of the rule.

For the national impacts analysis, the EPA believes that 75 percent is a reasonable assumption for the amount of waste
that is converted from surface impoundment to tank management. As discussed further in the BID for the final rule,
the EPA selected the 75 percent value based on information obtained by the EPA from a telephone survey of owners and
operators of large TSDF and from TSDF site visits as well as information provided to the EPA by several TSDF owners and
operators in comments on the proposed rule. The EPA did not find nor receive any additional information from the commenter
that justifies increasing the percentage of waste converted from surface impoundment to tank management.

The cancer risk impact analysis for this rulemaking was conducted in accordance with the EPA's Exposure Assessment
Guidelines. With regard to the 70 year lifetime assumption used in the impact analysis, the EPA believes 70 years to
be conservative, but plausible. The EPA did however conduct a second risk assessment assuming a 33 year exposure scenario
(95 percentile). Using this assumption reduced risk estimates by one-half, but did not change the decision to control
these facilities, nor the choice of control options. Furthermore, the risk assessment conducted here was for the
purpose of determining relative differences in risk estimates between the control options. For this application,
the exposure scenario would not matter; the results, i.e., the relative differences in risk estimates, would not
change.

The EPA holds that the assumptions used to determine the MIR are, as with the 70 year exposure scenario, conservative,
but plausible, and result in a reasonable overall estimate of risk. In addition, while the EPA acknowledges the uncertainties
associated with the MIR, such uncertainties cancel out when the risk assessment is used to discern relative risk,
as in this case. Thus the EPA believes that the use of the MIR is an appropriate tool to apply in the impact analysis for
this rulemaking to both estimate risk and to discern differences between risk estimates associated with the various
control options.

Many commenters disagree with the EPA's decision to require air emission controls for containers under the subpart
CC standards. One group of commenters argues that the organic emission potential from TSDF containers does not warrant
the application of additional controls beyond those already required by existing RCRA standards. A second group
of commenters contends that TSDF containers should not be subject to this rulemaking because the EPA analysis does
not show organic emissions from TSDF containers to be a significant emission source warranting controls.
