Asylum-Seekers Irritate Coalition"] 
  [Excerpts] The Hague -- Development Cooperation Minister 
Pronk earned himself the irritation of the CDA [Christian 
Democratic Appeal] and VVD [People's Party For Freedom and 
Democracy] yesterday by criticizing the cabinet's policies on 
asylum-seekers. He said the deployment of some 1,000 extra 
officers in the military police and police to monitor foreigners 
was "too ambitious." 
  "By putting in more than 1,000 extra people, the impression 
of panic is created," the minister said. He said the package of 
measures announced last week by State Secretary for Justice 
Kosto on the Evangelical Broadcasting Corporation's "Time 
Signal" news show was "unacceptable." [passage omitted] 
  According to Pronk, the current flow of asylum-seekers was a 
direct consequence of the Netherlands's decision to sign the 
Schengen Treaty. "We decided fat too lightly to bring down the 
internal borders," he said. "We did that to strengthen the 
economy, but it also had consequences for mobility. We put up 
with that because the economic gains were bigger. So it is a 
bit hypocritical to say that the borders have to be closed again 
now," Pronk said. 
  He also warned that the "mood" for good policies on 
asylum-seekers was in the process of becoming harder. "Step by 
step the mood is becoming egocentric," he said.
