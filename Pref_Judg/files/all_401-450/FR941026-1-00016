<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
 The Interregional Research Project No. 4 (IR&hyph;4), New Jersey Agricultural Experiment Station, P.O. Box 231,
Rutgers University, New Brunswick, NJ 08903, has submitted pesticide petition (PP) 0E3907 to EPA on behalf of the
Agricultural Experiment Station of California. This petition requests that the Administrator, pursuant to section
408(e) of the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act (FFDCA), 21 U.S.C. 346a(e), establish a tolerance for combined
residues of the herbicide 3,5-dichloro-

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
-(1,1-dimethyl-2-propynyl)benzamide (also referred to in this document as pronamide) and its metabolites (calculated
as 3,5-dichloro-

per million (ppm).
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The scientific data submitted in the petition and other relevant material have been evaluated. The toxicological
data considered in support of the proposed tolerance include:
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
1. A 90-day feeding study with rats administered pronamide in the diet at concentrations of 0, 40, 200, 1,000, or 4,000
ppm (equivalent to 0, 2.5, 12.3, 60.0, or 254.0 milligrams (mg)/kilogram (kg)/day in males; 0, 3.1, 15.0, 74.6, or
289.2 mg/kg/day in females). A systemic no-observed-effect level (NOEL) was established at 200 ppm (12.3 mg/kg/day/male;
15 mg/kg/day/female). A systemic lowest-effect level (LEL) was established at 1,000 ppm (60.0 mg/kg/day/male;
74.6 mg/kg/day/female), based on increased liver relative weight and incidence of liver histopathology in both
sexes, decreased body/weight gain and feed consumption in females, and increased blood cholesterol level in males.
Effects observed at the high dose (4,000 ppm) include decreases in body weight/weight gain and feed consumption in
both sexes, and increases in liver-related effects and in the histopathology of the thyroid (both sexes) and anterior
pituitary (males).
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
2. A 52-week chronic feeding study with dogs fed diets containing 0, 300, 875, or 1,750 ppm (equivalent to 0, 11.9, 33.1,
or 67.7 mg/kg/day in males; or 0, 11.9, 36.1, or 69.0 mg/kg/day in females) with a NOEL established at 300 ppm, based
on increases in serum alkaline phosphatase in males and thyroid weight in females, and in liver pathology in both sexes
at the 875-ppm dose level. Additional effects observed at the highest dose tested (1,750 ppm) include decreases in
body weight/feed consumption, increases in serum alkaline phosphatase and gamma glutamyl transferase in both sexes,
increases in serum alanine aminotransferase in females, and increases in testes relative weight in males.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
3. An 18-month carcinogenicity study with B6C3F1 mice fed diets containing 0, 1,000, or 2,000 ppm (approximately
0, 150, or 300 mg/kg/day) with a dose-related increase in incidence of hepatocellular carcinomas in male mice sacrificed
at 18 months. The increases in tumor rates observed at 1,000 and 2,000 ppm were statistically significant by pair-wise
comparison with the control. There were no carcinogenic effects observed in female mice under the conditions of the
study. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
4. A 24-month chronic feeding/carcinogenicity study with rats fed diets containing 0, 40, 200, or 1,000 ppm (equivalent
to 0, 1.73, 8.46, or 42.59 mg/kg/day/male and 0, 2.13, 10.69, or 55.09 mg/kg/day/female). The NOEL for systemic (nonneoplastic)
effects was established at 8.46 mg/kg/day/males and 10.69 mg/kg/day females, based on decreased body weight/body
weight gain and increased liver weight, as well as an increased incidence of hepatic centrilobular hypertrophy,
eosinophilic cell alterations, and thyroid follicular cell hypertrophy in both sexes at the high-dose level. Rats
fed at the high-dose level also showed an increased incidence of thyroid tumor (thyroid follicular cell adenomas)
and testicular tumor (benign testicular interstitial cell tumors) rates, which exceeded historical control ranges.
There was no progression from thyroid and testicular tumors to carcinomas.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
5. A two-generation reproduction study with rats fed diets containing 0, 40, 200, or 1,500 ppm (approximately 0, 3.0,
15.4, or 114.0 mg/kg/day/P1 males and 0, 3.2, 16.5, or 127.3 mg/kg/day/P2 males during pre-mating period; group time-weighted
average approximately 0, 4.1, 20.2, and 158.2 mg/kg/day/P1 females and 0, 4.0, 19.8, or 157.4 mg/kg/day/P2 females).
The reproductive NOEL was established at 200 ppm, based on decreased combined male/female pup weight per litter at
the 1,500-ppm dose level. A NOEL for parental systemic effects was established at 200 ppm, based on decreased body
weight and food consumption and histopathology of the liver and adrenal in both sexes, the thyroid in females, and
the anterior pituitary in males at the 1,500-ppm dose level. These effects were observed in both P1 and P2 generations.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
6. A developmental toxicity study with rabbits given gavage doses of 0, 5, 20, or 80 mg/kg/day during gestation days
7 through 19 with a developmental NOEL established at 20 mg/kg/day, based on late resorption (2 of 5 abortions at the
80 mg/kg/day dose level each showed one incidence of late resorption). The maternal NOEL was established at 20 mg/kg/day,
based on one mortality, abortions in 5 of 16 animals, body weight loss, and liver histopathology at the 80 mg/kg/day
dose level.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
7. A developmental toxicity study with rats given gavage doses of 0, 5, 20, 80, or 160 mg/kg/day on gestation days 6 through
15 with no clinical signs of toxicity under the conditions of the study. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
8. Mutagenicity tests, including gene mutation (Ames test), forward gene mutation (CH V79 cells), structural chromosome
aberration in vitro (CHO cells), structural chromosome aberration in vivo (mouse bone marrow cells), and UDNA synthesis
(primary hepatocytes of rats), were all negative. The results of the mutagenicity test indicate that pronamide does
not appear to be mutagenic.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Office of Pesticide Programs' Carcinogenicity Peer Review Committee has classified pronamide as a Group B2 carcinogen
(a probable human carcinogen), based on the findings of two types of tumors in the rat (uncommon benign testicular
interstitial cell tumors and thyroid follicular cell adenomas) and one type (liver carcinomas) in the mouse. The
upper limit on the carcinogenic risk from dietary exposure resulting from established uses of pronamide and the proposed
use on radicchio is estimated at 4.9 X 10

 for the general population. The carcinogenic risk assessment for pronamide was calculated based on a potency estimator

 and an Anticipated Residue Contribution (ARC) calculated at 0.000032 mg/kg/body weight/day.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The reference dose (RfD) is established at 0.080 mg/kg of body weight/day. The RfD is based on an NOEL of 8.46 mg/kg/day
from the rat 2-year feeding study and an uncertainty factor of 100. The ARC from established uses and the proposed use
of pronamide utilizes less than 1 percent of the RfD for the U.S. population and all subgroups of the population currently
evaluated by EPA's Dietary Risk Evaluation System.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The nature of the residue in plants is adequately understood. The residues of concern are pronamide and its metabolites
containing the 3,5-dichlorophenyl moiety. An adequate analytical method, gas chromatography, is available for
enforcement purposes. The analytical method for enforcing this tolerance has been published in the Pesticide Analytical
Manual, Vol. II (PAM II). There is no reasonable expectation that secondary residues will occur in milk, eggs, or meat
of livestock and poultry: radicchio greens are not considered to be livestock feed items.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
There are presently no actions pending against the continued registration of this chemical.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Based on the information and data considered, the Agency has determined that the tolerance established by amending
40 CFR part 180 would protect the public health. Therefore, it is proposed that the tolerance be established as set
forth below.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Any person who has registered or submitted an application for registration of a pesticide, under the Federal Insecticide,
Fungicide, and Rodenticide Act (FIFRA) as amended, which contains any of the ingredients listed herein, may request
within 30 days after publication of this document in the 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 that this rulemaking proposal be referred to an Advisory Committee in accordance with section 408(e) of the FFDCA.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Interested persons are invited to submit written comments on the proposed regulation. Comments must bear a notation
indicating the document control number, [PP 0E3907/P588]. All written comments filed in response to this petition
will be available in the Public Response and Program Resources Branch, at the address given above from 8 a.m. to 4 p.m.,
Monday through Friday, except legal holidays.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Under Executive Order 12866 (58 FR 51735, Oct. 4, 1993), the Agency must determine whether the regulatory action is
``significant'' and therefore subject to all the requirements of the Executive Order (i.e., Regulatory Impact Analysis,
review by the Office of Management and Budget (OMB)). Under section 3(f), the order defines ``significant'' as those
actions likely to lead to a rule (1) having an annual effect on the economy of $100 million or more, or adversely and materially
affecting a sector of the economy, productivity, competition, jobs, the environment, public health or safety, or
State, local or tribal governments or communities (also known as ``economically significant''); (2) creating serious
inconsistency or otherwise interfering with an action taken or planned by another agency; (3) materially altering
the budgetary impacts of entitlement, grants, user fees, or loan programs; or (4) raising novel legal or policy issues
arising out of legal mandates, the President's priorities, or the principles set forth in this Executive Order.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Pursuant to the terms of this Executive Order, EPA has determined that this rule is not ``significant'' and is therefore
not subject to OMB review.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Pursuant to the requirements of the Regulatory Flexibility Act (Pub. L. 96-354, 94 Stat. 1164, 5 U.S.C. 601&hyph;612),
the Administrator has determined that regulations establishing new tolerances or raising tolerance levels or establishing
exemptions from tolerance requirements do not have a significant economic impact on a substantial number of small
entities. A certification statement to this effect was published in the
