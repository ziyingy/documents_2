FRANCE has threatened not to apply the Schengen accord on free travel in
continental Europe next year, unless the Dutch government curbs the sale of
soft drugs.
Northern French cities such as Lille and Roubaix face serious social
problems from both hard and soft drugs imported from Amsterdam and fear
Schengen will worsen the crisis unless the Dutch clamp down. According to Mr
Pierre Mauroy, mayor of Lille and former prime minister, there has been a
sharp rise over the past 18 months in imports of heroin and ecstasy by
youngsters who drive to Amsterdam to buy drugs.
'France cannot accept the application of the Schengen accords unless the
Netherlands change their legislation, their regulation and their judicial
practice on drugs,' Mr Paul Quiles, the interior minister, told a senate
hearing.
The Schengen accord, which obliges its nine European signatories to scrap
passport checks on their shared borders, is due to be operational on land
frontiers by the middle of 1993.
The Dutch-Belgian frontier is already control-free, under a special Benelux
accord, while customs make only random checks on the Belgian-French border.
Such checks would vanish completely if Schengen came into effect.
Privately, Dutch officials described France's remarks as an attempt to
discredit their candidacy for the siting of 'Europol', a proposed EC police
clearing house for information on drug trafficking. The Hague, Strasbourg
and Rome are all vying for the institution.
Dutch drugs policy is aimed at tackling trafficking in hard and soft drugs
rather than possession of small quantities of soft drugs.
