THE European commission will take legal action against EC members which fail
to remove passport controls at internal EC borders by the end of this year,
the internal market commissioner warned yesterday.
Controls on all travellers within the EC should have been lifted on January
1, 1993, according to the Commission, but a combination of political, legal
and technical obstacles prevented the 12 from meeting the deadline.
Addressing members of the European Parliament yesterday, Mr Raniero Vanni
d'Archirafi, internal market commissioner, set a new deadline of the end of
1993.
He said it would be counterproductive to take legal action against
individual member states immediately. He also said legislation alone would
be insufficient to abolish controls.
But he emphasised that Brussels would take action if member states failed to
remove passport checks at land and sea borders by July, and at airports by
December.
Mr Vanni d'Archirafi said he had been encouraged by progress made by all 12
member states in opening borders during the first three months of this year.
The nine members of the Schengen free travel agreement are not yet satisfied
that checks at external EC frontiers are strong enough to allow internal
controls to be eased. The Schengen convention still has to be ratified by
Germany and Greece, but Mr Vanni d'Archirafi said he hoped Germany at least
would ratify by early July.
The commissioner said yesterday that if there was a clear political will to
lift border controls, he would not accept technical excuses for delaying the
removal of passport checks.
He is likely to have greater difficulty persuading Britain to abandon
passport checks. The UK disputes the Commission's interpretation that
controls must be lifted on all travellers within the Community, and says the
rules apply only to EC travellers.
Mr Vanni d'Archirafi, who favours a non-confrontational approach, said he
had been encouraged by the gradual introduction of what he called the 'blue
wave' - a system by which EC citizens simply show the cover of their
passports at internal borders.
