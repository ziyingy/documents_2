  [Text] Beijing, January 26 (XINHUA) -- Bai Jingfu, deputy 
head and secretary general of the National Narcotics Control 
Commission of China, held talks here Tuesday [25 January] with 
visiting U.S. Assistant Secretary of State Robert Gelbard on 
anti-drug issue. 
  In a sincere and friendly atmosphere, Bai, also 
vice-minister

on international drug-related crimes, especially on how to deal 
with the "golden triangle", place of origin for much of the 
world's illegal drug trade. 
  They agreed that it is necessary for China and the United 
States to strengthen cooperation in anti-narcotics efforts. 
  Bai said China hopes that the U.S. side would take positive 
steps to remove obstacles and promote a smoother and healthier 
development of Sino-U.S. anti-narcotics cooperation. 
  Gelbard pledged to work in this direction.
