  [Text] The data of epidemiological investigations devoted 
to the study of the cardiovascular diseases (CVD) suggest that 
the prevalence of the latter is associated with the level of 
risk factors (RF) in various population groups [4, 14, 17, 26, 
27]. This has been confirmed by the relationship discovered 
between the frequency of identification of CVD and of RF in 
population investigations [7, 11, 14, 18]. As has been 
demonstrated in large prospective investigations, morbidity from 
CVD and mortality from them are determined to a significant 
extent by the level of RF in populations [17, 25]. 
  The epidemiological situation with respect to CVD depends to 
a significant extent also on the frequency of identification of 
various combinations of RF in populations [1, 21, 24, 31]. In 
addition, according to the data of certain investigations, the 
level of RF in populations also depends on such characteristics 
as the age of the population, ethnic affiliation, educational 
level, and the character of the subject's work activity [2, 5, 
13, 23, 30]. And finally, the study of the prevalence of RF 
separately and especially in various combinations is very 
important from the point of view of the assessment of the 
prognostic significance of the level of RF for the development 
of new cases and of mortality from CVD among the population [6, 
10, 18, 31]. 
  The aim of the present investigations was to study the 
comparative characteristic of the prevalence of the principal 
CVD RF individually and in various combinations as a function of 
the character of work activity and educational level among the 
male population aged 20-54 years, living in cities of various 
regions of the CIS [Commonwealth of Independent States]. The 
investigation was carried out within the framework of the 
unified cooperative program, RThe Epidemiology of IHD and 
Atherosclerosis in Various Regions of the CIS and the Baltic 
CountriesS, carried out and coordinated by the Department of the 
Epidemiology of Noninfectious Diseases of the All-Russian 
Scientific Research Center of Preventive Medicine of the 
Ministry of Health of the Russian Federation [VNITsPM Minzdrava 
RF]. 
  Materials and Methods&gt; 
  Random representative samples of the male population aged 
20-54 years, living in one of the regions of eight cities, 
Moscow, St. Petersburg, Tallinn, Kiev, Novosibirsk, Alma-Ata, 
Tashkent, and Bishkek, were the material for the investigation. 
The number of subject in these cities ranged from 2350 to 2950 
persons with a response rate more than 70%. The program of 
study and its methods were presented in detail in previously 
published papers [8, 9]. Uniform criteria of the level of RF 
were used for all centers in the analysis of the data. A level 
of arterial pressure (AP) of 160/95 mm Hg and above (WHO 
criteria) corresponded to arterial hypertension (AH). The 
assessment of the presence dyslipoproteinemias (DLP) was based 
on the following criteria: a total blood cholesterol level of 
250 mg/dl and above corresponded to hypercholesterolemia (HCH); 
a blood level of total triglycerides of 200 mg/dl and above 
corresponded to hypertriglyceridemia (HTG); and a level of 
high-density lipoprotein cholesterol (HDL CH) of 35 mg/dl and 
below corresponded to hypoalphacholesterolemia (hypo-_a_-HDL 
CH) 
[22]. A body weight index [body weight (BWI) (in 
kg)/height[.sup]2[/] (in m)] of 29.5 kg/m[.sup]2[/] and 
above corresponded to excessive body weight (EBW) [12]. Any man 
smoking at least one cigarette per day was considered a smoker. 
All methods were carefully standardized before the beginning of 
the investigation, and quality control was constantly carried 
out during the investigation. Quality control of the lipid 
studies carried out in all centers was performed by the 
Department of Standardization of Biochemical Research Methods of 
the All-Russian Scientific Research Center of Preventive 
Medicine of the Ministry of Health of the Russian Federation. 
  Results 
  Data on the prevalence of RF (separately and in various 
combinations) in men aged 20-54 years are presented in Table 1. 
The per cent of individuals with one RF was minimal in 
populations of Bishkek and Kiev (26.1 and 28.6, respectively), 
and maximal in men from Moscow and St. Petersburg (42.8 and 
45.1, respectively). Smoking was the most frequently identified 
RF in the populations in question; its frequency ranged from 
13.0 (Bishkek) to 34.5% (St. Petersburg). DLP occupied 
second 
place in prevalence among the RF. This indicator was lowest in 
men from Novosibirsk and highest in the male population of 
Bishkek (3.1% versus 9.9%, respectively). The 
prevalence of 
DLP ranged from 4.1 to 6.3% in other populations. AH came 
next 
in the prevalence of RF, ranging from 1.9% in Tashkent to 
5.2% 
in Novosibirsk. The frequency of identification of EBW among the 
populations studied in Bishkek and Moscow was 0.6 and 
4.1%, 
respectively.

Note. Here and in Tables 2 and 3, the age-standardized indicator is cited. Standard - the male population of the CIS aged from 20 to 54 years. 


  The prevalence of a combination consisting of two RF was 
minimal in the men in Alma-Ata, maximal in Kiev (18.5 and 
30.5%, respectively). The combination of DLP and smoking 
was 
the most frequent combination of two RF in the populations 
examined, in particular, 8.9 and 14.0%, respectively, in 
Moscow 
and Tashkent. The combination of DLP and AH came next: its 
frequency was minimal among the men of Alma-Ata (0.9%), 
and 
maximal among the men of Bishkek (5.3%). The frequency of 
identification of the combinations of AH and EBW and EBW and 
smoking was somewhat lower. 
  The prevalence of a combination consisting of three RF was 
minimal among the men of Alma-Ata (2.7%), and maximal 
among the 
men of Tallinn (7.8%). DLP, smoking, and AH were included 
most 
frequently in a combination of three RF; such a combination was 
found in 0.8% of subjects from Alma-Ata and 3.3% 
of subjects 
from Tallinn. The combination of DLP, EBW, and AH was 
encountered somewhat less frequently: in 0.4% of men from 
Alma-Ata and 3.1% of subjects from Tallinn. The 
combination of 
RF consisting of AH, EBW, and smoking was minimal and maximal in 
Bishkek and Kiev (0.4 and 1.6%, respectively). There were 
overall RF in more than 70% of men studied from 
Novosibirsk and 
Tallinn. RF were observed in the male populations of Moscow and 
St. Petersburg in 68.3 and 69.6%, respectively. A lower RF 
prevalence was observed in men of the Central Asian region (in 
Bishkek, Tashkent, and Alma-Ata, respectively, 64.6, 69.9, and 
61.2%). 
  Data on the prevalence of RF separately and in various 
combinations in the men as a function of the character of their 
work activity are presented in Table 2. The presence of a single 
RF was identified more often in men engaged in physical labor; 
substantial differences in this connection were observed in 
workers doing physical and mental labor in Moscow, St. 
Petersburg, Tallinn, Kiev, and Alma-Ata. At the same time, the 
frequency of identification of smoking among the populations was 
substantially higher in physical laborers. The prevalence of AH 
alone was higher in intellectual workers in the populations from 
Tallinn, Kiev, and Novosibirsk. The frequency of identification 
of EBW did not depend on the character of work activity with the 
exception of men from Tashkent, where EBW was found twice as 
often among intellectual workers.

  A combination of two RF was found significantly more often 
in 
physical laborers only in the populations from Moscow, Tallinn, 
and Bishkek. In the remaining cities the combination of two RF 
did not depend on the character of the work activity of the men. 
The most frequent combination in both intellectual workers and 
physical laborers was the combination of DLP and smoking. This 
combination of RF was observed substantially more often in 
physical laborers from Moscow, St. Petersburg, Tallinn, 
Novosibirsk, and Tashkent. The combination of RF comprised of 
DLP and EBW was also identified substantially more often in men 
engaged in physical labor from St. Petersburg and Tallinn. At 
the same time, the combination of DLP and AH was found 
substantially more often in intellectual workers among the 
subjects from St. Petersburg. Other combinations of two RF in 
the populations did not depend on the character of the menUs 
work activity. 
  The prevalence of RF combinations consisting of three RF was 
higher in the majority of populations in physical laborers, but 
a significant difference was observed only in the subjects from 
St. Petersburg and Kiev. DLP, AH, and smoking were included in 
the combination of three RF most often. 
  Overall, in all of populations studied, such RF as DLP, AH, 
EBW, and smoking, were observed individually and in various 
combinations more often in physical laborers. It should be 
emphasized that RF combinations were encountered in both 
intellectual workers and physical laborers substantially more 
often in populations living in the European part of the CIS and 
Siberia, while the frequency of identification of RF was 
significantly lower in men from the Central Asian region. 
  Comparative data on the prevalence of RF individually and in 
various combinations as a function of the educational level of 
the men are presented in Table 3. The presence of one RF was 
observed substantially more often in Moscow, Tallinn, and 
Alma-Ata in individuals with secondary and elementary education. 
RF were recorded individually more often in men with elementary 
education among those from Tallinn and Novosibirsk. DLP was 
found significantly more frequently in men with higher education 
in Moscow, St. Petersburg, Tallinn, Kiev, Alma-Ata, and Bishkek. 
Whereas, the frequency of smoking was substantially higher in 
individuals with elementary education in Moscow, Tallinn, 
Novosibirsk, and Alma-Ata. Further, the prevalence of smoking in 
men in Moscow, Tallinn, and Alma-Ata with elementary and 
secondary education was higher than in individuals with higher 
education. The frequency of identification of smoking in men 
with higher and secondary education from St. Petersburg and 
Bishkek was significantly higher than in individuals with 
elementary education. The prevalence of AH separately was 
somewhat greater in individuals with higher education, but 
significant differences were observed only in Tallinn and 
Novosibirsk. The presence of RF individually in the male 
population from Tashkent did not depend on the educational 
level. Smoking was the most prevalent RF in the men; its 
frequency was higher in individuals with elementary education, 
whereas DLP and AH were encountered somewhat more often in men 
with secondary and higher education.

  Combinations of two RF were encountered more often in 
Moscow, 
Novosibirsk, Alma-Ata, and Tashkent in individuals with 
elementary education. The prevalence of a combination of two RF 
was higher in the men of St. Petersburg and Bishkek only in 
individuals with secondary education. A combination of two RF in 
Moscow in men with elementary and secondary education was 
identified significantly more frequently than in men with higher 
education. DLP and smoking were included in a combination of two 
RF most often. Such a combination was observed more often in 
subjects with elementary education in Tallinn, Alma-Ata, 
Novosibirsk, and Tashkent. The prevalence of the combination of 
AH and smoking was also higher in men with elementary education 
among the subjects from Moscow and Novosibirsk. The combination 
of DLP and AH was encountered significantly more often in men 
with higher education in Tallinn and Novosibirsk. The prevalence 
of such RF combinations as AH and EBW and EBW and smoking did 
not depend on the menUs educational level. 
  The prevalence of combinations if three RF overall did not 
depend on the menUs educational level, although there was a 
tendency in the majority of the populations to the more frequent 
identification of a combination of three RF and individuals with 
elementary education (see Table 3). 
  RF were observed significantly more frequently in 
individuals 
with elementary education in the populations of Moscow, Tallinn, 
Novosibirsk, Alma-Ata, and Tashkent; they were identified at a 
frequency ranging from 65.3 to 81.5%. The prevalence of 
RF in 
Moscow, Tallinn, and Alma-Ata in men with secondary education 
was substantially higher than in individuals with higher 
education, but at the same time lower than in men with 
elementary education. RF were identified significantly more 
often in the men of St. Petersburg and Bishkek in those with 
secondary education. The prevalence of RF in Kiev was 
significantly higher in individuals with secondary education 
than in those with higher and elementary education. At the same 
time, the frequency of identification of RF in men with higher 
education from Kiev was substantially higher than in individuals 
with elementary education. 
  Thus, the results of the investigations suggest that RF as a 
whole, depending on the character of the work activity and 
educational level of the men, were encountered more often among 
populations living in the cities of the European region, 
Siberia, and less often, in men of the Central Asian region. The 
highest prevalence of RF individually and in various 
combinations, as well as in relation to the character of work 
and educational level, was observed in the men from Novosibirsk 
and Tallinn. 
  Discussion 
  It was established, when populations of men were examined on 
the basis of a unified program and standard methods, that there 
were RF separately and in various combinations in the majority 
of the men in cities of various regions of the CIS and Estonia; 
at the same time, the level of RF was higher in the cities of 
the European part and Siberia, while RF were recorded 
substantially less frequently in the men of the Central Asian 
region. Smoking and DLP were most prevalent among the RF studied 
in the populations. DLP and smoking were included in a 
combination of two RF most often; DLP, smoking, and AH, in a 
combination of three RF. Very similar data have also been 
obtained in other population studies. Thus, RF were found when 
men 20-59 years of age in Moscow were examined in 76%; at 
the 
same time, smoking was the most prevalent RF [12]. Similar data 
have been obtained for other populations as well [2, 5, 20]. 
When 522 inhabitants of the island of Newfoundland were 
examined, RF were identified in 78%; HCH (61% at 
CH criteria 
&gt;  200 mg/dl), EBW, and smoking were encountered most 
frequently 
[23]. 
  RF were observed more often in our investigation in physical 
laborers. Differences in the RF level among intellectual workers 
and physical laborers were determined first of all by a higher 
frequency of smoking and its combinations with DLP and AH. In 
other investigations carried out in populations from the CIS, 
also among men engaged in physical labor, a higher prevalence of 
smoking and its combinations with other RF was observed [3, 13, 
15]. Data are available regarding the higher prevalence of RF 
individually and in various combinations among workers of 
industrial enterprises of Norilsk [16]. 
  When the men were studied in relation to educational level, 
we established that the frequency of RF individually and in 
different combinations has an inverse relationship to the 
educational level. The highest level of RF is observed in the 
majority of populations in individuals with elementary 
education; a lower level, in men with higher education. A 
similar relationship of the prevalence of RF as a function of 
educational level was identified in populations from Minneapolis 
(USA) and Australia [28, 29]. 
  Conclusions 
  1. For men living in various cities of the CIS, a high 
prevalence of risk factors (RF) individually and in various 
combinations, is characteristic; at the same time, the RF level 
is substantially higher in men from the European part and 
Siberia than in populations from the Central Asian region. 
  2. In descending order with respect to frequency of 
identification, the following RF are most prevalent among the 
men of the various cities of the CIS: smoking, 
dyslipoproteinemia (DLP), arterial hypertension (AH), and 
excessive body weight (EBW). DLP and smoking are included in a 
combination of two RF most often; DLP, AH, and smoking in a 
combination of three. 
  3. The prevalence of RF individually and in various 
combinations depends on the character of the work activity of 
the men: the level of RF is higher in men engaged in physical 
labor than in individuals engaged in intellectual work. 
  4. The prevalence of RF separately and in various 
combinations as a function of educational level, exhibits an 
inverse relationship: the highest RF level is observed in men 
with elementary education, the lowest in men with higher 
education.
