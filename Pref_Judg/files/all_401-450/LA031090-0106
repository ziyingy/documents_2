For the first time since the Rev. Robert H. Schuller founded the Garden Grove 
Community Church at a drive-in movie theater 35 years ago, he will be joined by 
a co-pastor. 
</P>
<P>
The Rev. Bruce Larson, 64, senior pastor at 3,600-member University 
Presbyterian Church in Seattle, will begin his work at the Crystal Cathedral 
this June, Schuller, 63, announced this week. 
</P>
<P>
Schuller will spend most of his time running his television ministry and will 
continue to conduct Sunday services for broadcast on his "Hour of Power" 
television show, church officials said. 
</P>
<P>
A church spokeswoman said the appointment does not mean that Schuller intends 
to change his plans to hand over the ministries to his son, Robert A. Schuller, 
in another 10 years or so. 
</P>
<P>
"I am strictly the No. 2 man (at the Crystal Cathedral)," Larson, said in a 
telephone interview. "I am there to assist Bob to help build and bless that 
congregation."
