Four people have died of carbon monoxide poisoning in a motor home outside a 
mountain lodge east of here, authorities said Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
Sheriff's investigators said the victims died New Year's Day while camping in 
Mt. Laguna in the Cleveland National Forest. 
</P>
<P>
The coroner's office identified them as Katherine Walsh, 30; Michael McCrae, 
32; Conan Lemmer, 28, and Graham Rayner, 28, all of San Diego. 
</P>
<P>
The four were on a vacation in McCrae's motor home and were using a generator 
to power a heater in the 30-degree weather, but the exhaust pipe was too short 
to allow proper ventilation, deputies said.
