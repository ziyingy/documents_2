CHEN Binfan, the vice-governor of Hunan province, sits back and reflects.
'As the old Chinese proverb says: If you don't expose the child then you
will never catch the wolf.'
For Mr Chen, a native of Fujian province and a man who has spent three years
in Japan and another five in Hong Kong, catching the wolf is a metaphor for
the economic development of Hunan; and the child in need of exposure is the
local economy to market forces.
'If you can not make big strides then you will be left behind by the
others,' he says.
Hunan, China's premiere rice growing region situated in the south east of
the country, is a middle ranking province in terms of income and prosperity.
It is not as prosperous as the coastal regions of China, but neither is it
as poor as the south west or north west.
Its urban population's average income was Yn1,552 in 1991 - slightly lower
than the national average of Yn1,570 - while the Hunan agricultural
workforce had an average income of Yn688, compared with the Yn710
nationally. Last year industrial and agricultural output grew by 9 per cent;
inflation rose by 4 per cent.
Behind these numbers is a remarkable phenomenon and one which is occurring
throughout China: the growth of industry outside the central planning and
direction of Beijing. Rural and township industries in Hunan have, over the
past decade, come from nothing to occupy a vital part in the local economy.
Last year the output of these industries grew by 15.6 per cent; they account
for 41 per cent of industrial output in the province.
The large growth in rural industries has enabled surplus agricultural labour
to remain in rural areas, thereby relieving the cities of the large scale
migration that has historically occurred in other countries which have gone
through a period of high speed industrialisation.
More than 4m are employed in township and rural industries and 1m have been
sent to Guangdong on temporary work assignment, but the province still has a
surplus of rural labour estimated at about 5m.
Some village and township companies are little more than cottage industries,
such as a sack manufacturer owned and run by Huang Jin village, 60
kilometres from Changsha, the capital of Hunan. Others, such as the Yuelu
Shoe Factory, situated in a township on the edge of Changsha are more
serious ventures.
This factory makes 4m pairs of sports shoes a year, for markets in the
Middle East, Europe and the US. It employs 700 people, mostly young women,
and has a joint venture with a Hong Kong company in Shenzhen, the special
economic zone in Guangdong that boarders Hong Kong. But Yuelu's cost
structure underlines why much of the world's low value-added shoe
manufacturers are being transplanted to China: the labour cost per pair of
shoes is just 15 US cents.
Mr Chen makes much of Hunan's comparative advantages of which cheap labour
is one. Another is the relatively low cost of electricity. He points out
that in Hunan industry pays an average 18.5 fen a kilowatt hour (there are
100 fen to a Yuan) compared with an average 40 fen a kilowatt hour in
Guangdong, the province which boarders Hunan to the south.
Yet how long this cheap energy can last is moot. In Yueyang, 150 kilometres
to the north on the Yangtze river, the Huaneng International Power
Development Corporation's latest twin 350MW thermal power station is going
through its final trials before full operation this summer.
It was built with aid from the British government and utilises generators
and turbines made by the General Electric Company.
The electricity plant was non-economic from day one, saddled with a
structural loss because of the state's pricing policy. Zhang Shang Zhi, the
plant's manager, explains that the state requires him to sell his
electricity for 25 fen a kilowatt hour, but it costs 35 fen a kilowatt hour
to produce.
'Because the electricity price is fixed by the Hunan government we have no
option,' says Mr Zhang. 'Even if we work hard the price is too low and we
cannot achieve economic efficiency. We will have to wait until next year for
the price to be increased.'
The economic pricing of energy in China is some way off, but the provincial
authorities in Hunan are trying to reform some aspects of the economic
system inherited from China's 30-year experiment with Maoist economics.
Much of this work is being done by a government department known as System
Reform.
Its head in Hunan is Yu Zhao Yong, director of the Hunan provincial
commission of economic structural reform. Mr Yu is charged with reform of
the state enterprises in the province - reform which owes its origin to the
policies being promulgated at a national level by Zhu Rongji, China's
industry minister.
The provincial authorities plan a five-pronged attack on state industries
this year. The thrust of the reforms is to increase incentives, relate
reward more closely to effort with job promotion and position more closely
linked to merit. The reforms concern changes to employment and social
security, and the introduction of capitalist forms of ownership, most
notably company shares.
The social welfare implications of the reforms appear to be the most
serious, especially the problem of unemployment.
According to Mr Yu, unemployment in Hunan is defined as those school and
college leavers without work. Currently 2.3 per cent or about 100,000 of
them are unemployed.
Those who are working for state enterprises but without work are not defined
as unemployed, but as redundant, and, he says, there are about 140,000
redundant state workers in Hunan. They continue to draw between 75 per cent
and 100 per cent of their wages and all the other benefits which go with
cradle to grave employment in China, such as housing, health and education,
at a nominal cost.
Hunan has decided to centralise the provision of some welfare services. Pay
for redundant workers is distributed through the labour bureau, which levies
charges on companies pro rata to the level of redundancy in their company.
The province is planning to retrain surplus industrial workers for jobs in
other manufacturing companies and the service sector.
