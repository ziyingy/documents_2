Ten Taiwanese fishing vessels impounded by Indonesia, British fishing nets
slashed in the Bay of Biscay, Japanese fishermen shot at by a Russian
gunboat, and an Icelandic trawler and Norwegian coastguard vessel exchanging
fire - in the past month, fish have been prompting diplomatic incidents and
this shows no sign of ending soon.
Fears are growing that over-fishing is depleting even the most abundant
species, while governments have so far failed to agree on ways to halt
disputes. Canada, which has suffered some of the sharpest recent declines in
its fish stocks, told a United Nations conference this month in New York
that the oceans were 'in crisis'. However the conference, attended by more
than 90 governments, ended on Friday night without consensus on how to
conserve the seas' resources.
Nearly 30 separate conflicts have flared in the past year over rights to
fishing. The catalyst for the disputes is that the amounts of fish caught
appear to be declining in the past few years, following four decades of
explosive expansion.
According to the UN Food and Agriculture Organisation, catches have risen
more than fourfold from 1950 to a peak of more than 90m tonnes in 1989. But
although precise figures are hard to establish, there are signs that
worldwide catch levels have since dropped by several per cent.
That halting of the industry's expansion, many fear, reflects the growing
scarcity of many types of fish. Environmental groups paint a vision of the
oceans in the next century as a desert. Western countries may see staples of
the kitchen cupboard such as tuna become expensive delicacies, they warn.
Asian and African governments are also becoming alarmed: fish accounts for
between a fifth and a third of the animal-derived protein in their
countries' diets, UN figures suggest, compared to only several per cent of
those in Western countries.
Scarcity of some species has forced fishermen and consumers to turn to new
types of fish. According to Greenpeace, while catch levels rose by a third
during the 1980s, almost all of that rise came from just five species:
Alaskan pollack, Chilean jack mackerel, Peruvian anchovies, and Japanese and
South American pilchards.
The huge increase in the catch of fish since the 1950s has been driven
partly by new technology. Fishing fleets home in on schools of fish using
sonar and radar. Winches and motors to haul drift nets, which can contain
more than 40,000 pounds of fish, have become more powerful, while nets have
become longer, with the inclusion of nylon fibres which reduce tearing. Nets
now frequently have mouths tens of metres wide, and can stretch for hundreds
of metres.
But environmentalists also attribute some of the increase in catch levels to
the changes in international fishing regulations more than a decade ago. The
1982 Law of the Sea pushed the boundaries of national waters outwards from
12 miles offshore to 200 miles.
The new rules, which brought more than three quarters of the world's fish
within national waters, was followed by a doubling of the size of the
world's fishing fleets, according to the UNFAO. Overcapacity - the total
number of vessels is estimated at some three million - has pushed many parts
of the industry into loss. According to the UNFAO, fishing fleets spent some
Dollars 92bn in 1989. Revenue figures are hard to establish with precision,
but UN figures and industry analysts suggest that they amounted only to some
Dollars 70bn.
Much of the shortfall is plugged by billions of pounds in government
subsidies. European Union countries alone spend nearly Dollars 600m a year,
according to UN estimates. Countries fear that if they surrender national
fishing rights they could lose tens of thousands of jobs. There is no
shortage of examples to fuel their anxiety. At least 20,000 people working
in the traditional cod fisheries of Newfoundland have been put out of work
since the Canadian government banned fishing in 1992 in an attempt to boost
depleted stocks. The government has since paid more than CDollars 1bn
(Pounds 400m) to support these communities.
The bitterest international rows in the past year have focused on
'migrating' fish such as tuna and swordfish which travel thousands of
kilometres through the high seas to feed and spawn. The past year's disputes
have also including rights to 'straddling' fish such as cod, herring and
some types of squid, which migrate between coastal and international waters.
Mr Satya Nandan, Fiji ambassador to the UN and chairman of the conference,
said last week that the required backing of two-thirds of the delegates
should be achievable as 'the overwhelming majority want a binding solution'.
Governments meet again in six months time. If the frequency of conflicts
stays at its present level, they will have every incentive to overcome those
differences.
