Gov. Deukmejian's family planning budget cuts will only cause more abortions in 
California. His actions are totally counterproductive to reducing abortions. He 
is saying that since Medi-Cal paid for 77,000 abortions last year, it is 
obvious that the money allocated for family planning is not working. He is, 
therefore, cutting their funding from $36 million to $12 million.

It is hard to believe that such a well-educated, elected official of our state 
could reach such an irrational conclusion. Saying that the 77,000 abortions are 
due to lack of family planning clinic effectiveness is ridiculous. The real 
problem is educating our sexually active young adults to use contraception and 
to increase its availability. This is how to reduce unwanted pregnancy and 
abortion.

<P>
Deukmejian has consistently fought against effective sex education, which must 
include a discussion of contraception, in our public schools. He has now cut 
the family planning budget in our state by two-thirds which will make it much 
more difficult for our young adults to get contraception if they decide to be 
sexually active.

<P>
It is hard to understand the governor's logic on this issue. He is completely 
wrong if he thinks that by not discussing contraception in schools and by 
decreasing the family planning budget, he will increase teen-age abstinence. 
The facts, which Deukmejian is well aware, are that 8 of 10 boys and 7 of 10 
girls are sexually active by the time they are seniors in high school.

<P>
Deukmejian must change his position, or he will be responsible for many more 
abortions in our state.
