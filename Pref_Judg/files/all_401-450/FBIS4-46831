<H5>  Prices for Consumer Goods and Services </H5>
  Over the period 4 to 10 May 1994 prices for consumer 
goods and services rose by 1.6 percent, including for foodstuffs 
and for-fee services for the population--by 1.9 percent, and 
nonfood items--by 1.2 percent. 
  The highest rate of increases in food prices was registered 
in the East Siberian region (3 percent), and the lowest--in the 
Northern and West Siberian regions (0.7-0.9 percent). Increases 
in prices for nonfood items ranged between 0.6 percent in cities 
of East Siberia and 2.2 percent in cities of the Northwestern 
region. 
  Indices of prices for consumer goods and services in the 
consumer market were as follows (as a percentage of the 
preceding date):

  Since the beginning of the month the current consumer 
price index measures 102.5 percent, including for 
foodstuffs--102.3 percent, nonfood items--102.6 percent, and 
for-fee services for the population--103.2 percent. 
  If the current rate of price increases remains at the same 
level, prices for consumer goods and services in May will 
increase overall by 7-8 percent. 
<H5>  Foodstuffs. </H5>
  Over the period 4 to 10 May prices in organized and 
nonorganized trade rose by 1.2 percent and 4.9 percent. 
  Price changes by main categories of food products are shown 
below (as a percentage of the preceding date):

  In organized trade over the elapsed week fresh 
produce prices rose at an anticipatory rate: cabbage, beets, and 
carrots--by 3-6 percent, onions--by 17 percent, and apples--by 9 
percent. There was practically no change in prices for basic 
food staples: milk, bread, sugar, eggs, butter, and vegetable 
oil. 
  Similar to organized trade, the greatest price rises in 
nonorganized trade were registered with respect to fresh 
produce. Prices for apples, cabbage, and onions rose over the 
week by 15-18 percent, and carrots, beets, and garlic--by 4-9 
percent. Prices for pork went up by 4 percent, and milk and milk 
products--by 1-2 percent. 
  The cost of the consumer basket of 19 basic 
foodstuffs increased over the week by 2.4 percent and as of 
10 May amounted to 49,700 rubles [R], calculated on a monthly 
basis. The price differential between monitored cities measured 
a factor of 4.7 as compared to 3.6 on 15 March of this year. The 
highest cost of the basket was registered in Magadan (R135,500) 
and the lowest--in Ulyanovsk (R29,000). In terms of the cost of 
the consumer basket, Moscow and St. Petersburg ranked 34th and 
45th among 132 monitored cities (R54,000 and R50,900 on a 
monthly basis). 
<H5>  Nonfood Items </H5>
  Over the period 4 to 10 May prices for nonfood items rose at 
a moderate rate. There was practically no change in prices for 
fabrics, clothing, and personal and household goods. At the same 
time there was a considerable increase in prices for certain 
medicines (by 9.9 percent), synthetic detergents, women's 
toiletries, and children's footwear (by 2.5-3.7 percent). 
<H5>  For-Fee Services for the Population </H5>
  There were no significant price increases with respect to 
consumer and transportation services over the elapsed week. 
Rents in municipal housing in Russia as a whole increased by 6.2 
percent, and the cost of some municipal services--by 8-10 
percent; rents and the cost of municipal services increased 
several-fold in Ulan-Ude, Elista, Chita, and Smolensk. 
<H5>  Industry. </H5>
  In January-April of this year Russian industry produced R77 
trillion worth of output in current prices. The physical 
volume of production declined by 25.4 percent as compared to 
January-April of last year, including in April--by 26.9 percent 
(in January-April 1993--by 18.6 percent, including in April--by 
16.4 percent). 
  Average daily production fell by 25.2 percent in April of 
this year as compared to the same month of last year, and by 3.3 
percent as compared to March of this year. 
  The volume of production fell mostly in the sectors 
producing 
predominantly capital goods and nonfood consumer items. For 
instance, while in the fuel and energy sector over the elapsed 
period of the year production fell by 11 percent and in the food 
processing industry by 21 percent, in machine building it fell 
by 45 percent, in the chemical and petrochemical industry--by 35 
percent, in the timber, woodworking, and pulp and paper 
industry--by 32 percent, and in light industry--by 39 percent. 
  The number of enterprises that experienced lengthy 
stoppages of all or some parts of production increased. 
While in January of this year there were 3,800 such enterprises, 
in April the number increased to more than 5,000. The main cause 
of the stoppages is difficulties in selling output. 
  In January-April 1994, of the 406 most important categories 
of products counted in periodic reports, the volume of 
production, as compared to January-April 1993: 
  --increased with respect to 24 items, (including 
iron ore pellets, coking equipment, cash registers, sulfur, 
parquet tile, ceramic floor tile, cotton fabrics, freezers, 
mayonnaise, sausages, cheeses and feta cheese, live and salted 
fish, cognac, and toothpaste), or 6 percent of the total number; 
  --decreased with respect to 377 items, or 93 
percent of the total number. With respect to 283 items (70 
percent of the total), production declined by one-quarter or 
more; among them are lubricant oils, sheet rolled metal, 
roll-formed sectional steel, steel pipe, gas and hydraulic steam 
turbines, diesels and diesel generators, freight and passenger 
railcars, city telephone cables, metal-cutting machine tools, 
drop forges, trolley buses, tractors, friction-free ball 
bearings, mineral fertilizer, chemical insecticides, synthetic 
dyes, synthetic rubber, automotive tires, lumber, wood-fiber and 
wood-chip board, cardboard, cement, prefabricated ferroconcrete 
components, wall materials, roof slate, asbestos, ceramic 
plumbing fixtures, outer knitwear, garments, fabrics of all 
types except cotton, hosiery, footwear, sewing and washing 
machines, electric vacuum cleaners, tape recorders, radio 
receivers, television sets, cereals, and macaroni items.

products over January-April 1994 are shown below:

<H5>  Agro-Industrial Complex </H5>
  By 10 May farms in practically all regions of the Russian 
Federation were sowing spring crops. In the country as a whole, 
spring crops were planted at 19.2 million hectares, of which 
13.6 million hectares were sown with grain crops. In the 
beginning of May of this year the pace of planting slowed down. 
Last year by this time spring crops had been planted on 22.3 
million hectares, including 15.3 million hectares sown with 
grain crops.

  Spring planting is almost completed on the territories of 
the 
Central Chernozem region, Krasnodar and Stavropol Krays, and 
Rostov and Ulyanovsk Oblasts, where spring grain planting areas 
exceed those of last year. 
  The greatest lag in planting spring grain crops is 
registered 
at farms in Ryazan, Nizhniy Novgorod, Samara, and Saratov 
Oblasts, where the area sown with grain crops comprises 56-70 
percent of that of last year, and Kirov Oblast--34 percent. 
  In January-April of this year industrial and 
distribution organizations shipped mineral fertilizer and 
fuel to agricultural consumers in the following volumes 
(millions of tonnes):

  The volume of petroleum products being purchased by 
enterprises through direct-delivery contracts continues to 
increase. Their proportional share in the total volume of 
deliveries comprises 12-13 percent. 
  In April of this year agricultural enterprises continued to 
increase the volume of petroleum product purchases, 
in which diesel fuel accounts for the greatest part of 
purchasing activity. As a result, over the past month stocks of 
diesel fuel at farms increased by 40 percent, and of 
gasoline--by 27 percent. At the same time, as of 1 May they had 
approximately one-third less fuel on hand than on the 
corresponding date last year. 
  Agricultural consumers have changed their approach to 
forming 
petroleum products reserves. They now do not accumulate 
substantial volumes of fuel but instead mainly buy it at 
petroleum warehouses as required by the expansion of 
agricultural work.

  At the beginning of May of this year the degree of 
readiness of fodder-harvesting equipment at Russian 
farms is below that of last year. Half of fodder-harvesting 
combines and mowers are currently in inoperable condition. 
  Shipments of greenhouse vegetables through all 
channels dropped by 21 percent over the four months of this year 
as compared to the same period of last year. Their sales to 
procurement organizations declined by one-third; sales through 
other channels (farmers markets, their own retail points of 
sale, and public catering enterprises) increased somewhat and 
accounted for one-third of the total volume of produce shipments. 
<H5>  Animal Husbandry </H5>
  In January-April of this year, as compared to the analogous 
period of 1993, quantities of livestock and poultry sold 
for slaughter by farms of all categories declined by an 
estimated 10 percent, production of milk--by 11 
percent, and eggs--by 6 percent. At agricultural 
enterprises the volume of production of meat and milk declined 
by 15-16 percent; at personal plots it remained more or less at 
last year's level. 
  A decline in the the animal herd is taking place 
mainly at agricultural enterprises where as of 1 May of this 
year, as compared to the analogous period of last year, the rate 
of herd reduction with respect to horned cattle amounted to 10 
percent, cows--7 percent, swine--14 percent, and poultry 
stocks--9 percent. Especially perceptible (almost one-quarter) 
was the decline in the herd of sheep and goats. These processes 
resulted in the changed structure of the total livestock 
herd--the proportion of horned cattle personally owned by 
individuals increased as compared to the beginning of May of 
last year from 23 percent to 26 percent, cows--from 31 percent 
to 34 percent, swine--from 27 percent to 30 percent, and sheep 
and goats--from 34 percent to 38 percent.

  Procurement of livestock and poultry from 
producers for state and regional food stocks decreased by 
one-quarter as compared to January-April 1993, of milk--by 23 
percent, and eggs--by 5 percent. At the same time, agricultural 
enterprises increased sales of animal husbandry products through 
other channels. Bypassing procurement organizations, 
agricultural enterprises sold through these channels over the 
elapsed period of the year 21 percent of cattle and poultry, 5.8 
percent of milk, and 8.4 percent of eggs (last year, 
respectively, 13 percent, 3 percent, and 8 percent). 
<H5>  Income of the Population </H5>
  The monetary income of the population over January-April of 
this year amounted to R78 trillion and was 8.5 times greater 
than in the corresponding period of 1993. 
  The population's disposable income (income less compulsory 
payments) increased by about 12 percent after factoring in the 
consumer price index. 
  The distribution of the Russian Federation population by 
size 
of per capita income in 1994 is characterized by the following

  In April 1993, 26 percent of the population had a per capita 
income of up to R10,000 a month, 40 percent--between R10,000 and 
R20,000 a month, 27 percent--between R20,000 and R40,000, and 7 
percent--more than R40,000. 
  The coefficient of income concentration (the Gini index) 
measured 0.311 in April 1994 (0.353 in April 1993).

  The change in the value of the subsistence minimum of 
the Russian Federation population in 1994 (determined in 
accordance with the methodology of the Russian Ministry of 
Labor) is shown in the following table:

  The income of 11 percent of the population (16 million 
persons) in April 1994 was below the sustenance minimum value; 
of these, the income of 3 percent of the population was below 
the value of the consumer food basket, which in the calculation 
of the subsistence minimum amounted to R45,400. 
  The estimated average wages earned by workers in 
April of this year in Russia as a whole amounted to R175,000--a 
6 percent increase as compared to March of this year and a 
1.3-fold increase as compared to January. 
<H5>  Employment </H5>
  The total number of unemployed in the Russian Federation at 
the end of April comprised 4.5 million persons, or 6 percent of 
total economically active population. Of them, about 1.2 million 
persons were officially designated as unemployed by state 
employment service organs (1.5 percent of the economically 
active population). In addition, the number of persons forced to 
work a shortened work week or take administrative leave without 
pay or with partial pay comprised an estimated 4.5 million. 
  Thus, in April of this year the total unemployment potential 
amounted to 9.0 million persons (8.8 million persons in March of 
this year). 
<H5>  Natural Demographic Trends </H5>
  In the first quarter of 1994 the indicators of natural 
changes in the population of the Russian Federation were as 
follows: 


                January-March 1994,   Per 1,000 population 
                thousand persons 

                                      January-March 

                                      1992          1993          1994 

Births          349.9                 11.4          9.6           9.6 

Deaths          591.6                 12.1          14.4          16.2 

Natural loss    241.7                 0.7           4.8           6.6 


  After six years (1988-1993) of intensive decline in the 
birth 
rate in the country there are currently some signs of 
stabilization: The total birth rate indicator for January-March 
1994 remained at the level of the first quarter of 1993--9.6 
births per 1,000 of the population. Also, in March, for the 
first time since 1987, there was a small (2,500, or 2 percent) 
increase in the number of births as compared to the same month 
of the preceding year. Overall over the first quarter a small 
increase in the birth rate was registered in 33 territories of 
Russia; at the same time, in 43 regions it continued to decline. 
The greatest decline in the birth rate--by 10-7 percent--was 
registered in the Republics of Mari El and Karelia, Yevreyskaya 
Autonomous Oblast, Ivanovo, Pskov, Arkhangelsk, and Bryansk 
Oblasts. The birth rate remains extremely low in St. Petersburg, 
Moscow, and Leningrad and Moscow Oblasts, where it does not 
exceed seven births per 1,000 inhabitants. 
  The improvement in the situation with respect to population 
reproduction is offset by the increased death rate. The number 
of deaths in January-March 1994 as compared to the corresponding 
period of 1993 increased by 63,100, and the total mortality 
indicator rose to 16.2 deaths per 1,000 population, or by 12 
percent. An especially considerable increase in the death rate 
was registered in the Republic of Mordvinia--by 28 percent, 
Novosibirsk Oblast--by 25 percent, Perm Oblast--by 23 percent, 
Pskov Oblast--by 21 percent, Kostroma, Moscow, and Tver 
Oblasts--by 20 percent, Sverdlovsk and Chita Oblast and the 
Republic of Udmurtia--by 19 percent. 
  Similar to last year, the greatest increase in the mortality 
rate--by 20 percent--was registered with respect to accidental 
poisoning by alcohol; mortality caused by contagious and 
parasite-born diseases--by 18 percent; and that from circulatory 
system diseases--by 15 percent. 
  Because of higher mortality, natural population loss 
increased over the first quarter of this year by 66,200, or 38 
percent. In the overwhelming majority of Russia's regions the 
number of deaths now exceeds the number of births--in 24 
territories by a factor of two or three. 
<H5>  Cargo Deliveries by Waterways to Regions of the Far North </H5>
  As of 1 May of this year, 1.8 times less cargo was shipped 
by 
sea to regions of the Far North than of the same date last year.
