BRITISH NUCLEAR Fuels is to appeal to Mr Michael Howard, environment
secretary, against refusal by the Lake District Special Planning Board to
allow exploratory drilling in the Lake District national park in its search
for space for a Pounds 2.5bn nuclear waste repository.
The appeal on behalf of UK Nirex, the nuclear-waste consortium, follows a
decision to refuse permission for a borehole several miles inland from the
Sellafield nuclear-waste reprocessing site.
The board rejected the proposals because of the harmful effect on the
landscape and noise and disturbance.
