<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Epidemiology has been defined as ``the study of the distributions and determinants of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
disease and injuries in human populations'' (Mausner and Kramer, 1985). Knowing the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
frequency of illness in groups and the factors that influence the distribution is the tool of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
epidemiology that allows the evaluation of causal inference with the goal of prevention and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
cure of disease. Epidemiologic studies are a means of evaluating the effects of neurotoxic 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
substances in human populations, but such studies are limited because they must be 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
performed shortly after exposure if the effect is acute. Most often these effects are suspected 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
to be a result of occupational exposures due to the increased opportunity for exposure to 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
industrial and other chemicals.

3.4.1.1. Case reports. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The first type of human study undertaken is the case report or case 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
series, which can identify cases of a disease and are reported by clinicians or discerned 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
through active or passive surveillance, usually in the workplace. For example, the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
neurological hazards of exposure to Kepone, dimethylaminopropionitrile, and methyl-n-butyl 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
ketone were first reported as case studies by physicians who noted an unusual cluster of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
diseases in persons later found to have been exposed to these chemicals (Cone et al., 1987). 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
However, case histories where exposure involved a single neurotoxic agent, though 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
informative, are rare in the literature; for example, farmers are exposed to a wide variety of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
potentially neurotoxic pesticides. Careful case histories assist in identifying common risk 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
factors, especially when the association between the exposure and disease is strong, the mode 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
of action of the agent is biologically plausible, and clusters occur in a limited period of time. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Case reports are inexpensive compared with other types of epidemiologic studies and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
can be obtained more quickly than more complex studies. They provide little information 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
about disease frequency or population at risk, but their importance has been clearly 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
demonstrated, particularly in accidental poisoning or acute exposure to high levels of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
toxicant. They remain an important source of index cases of new diseases and for 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
surveillance in occupational settings. These studies require confirmation by additional 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
epidemiologic research employing other study design.

3.4.1.2. Cross-sectional studies. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
In cross-sectional studies or surveys, both the disease and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
suspected risk factors are ascertained at the same time and the findings are useful in 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
generating hypotheses. A group of people is interviewed, examined, and tested at a single 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
point in time to ascertain a relationship between a disease and a neurotoxic exposure. This 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
study design does not allow the investigator to determine whether the disease or the exposure 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
came first, rendering it less useful in estimating risk. These studies are intermediate in cost 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
and time required to complete compared with case reports and more complex analytical 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
studies.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=81 g=1 f=1 -->
3.4.1.3. Case-control (retrospective) studies. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Last (1986) defines a case-control study as 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
one that ``starts with the identification of persons with the disease (or other outcome variable) 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
of interest, and a suitable control population (comparison, reference) group of persons 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
without the disease.'' He states that the relationship of an ``attribute'' to the disease is 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
measured by comparing the diseased with the nondiseased with regard to how frequently the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
attribute is present in each of the groups. The cases are assembled from a population of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
persons with and without exposure and the comparison group is selected from the same 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
population; the relative distribution of the potential risk factor (exposure) in both groups is 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
evaluated by computing an odds ratio that serves as an estimate of the strength of the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
association between the disease and the potential risk factor. The statistical significance of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the ratio is determined by calculating a p-value and is used to approximate relative risk. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The case-control approach to the study of potential neurotoxins in the environment has 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
provided a great deal of information. In his recent text, Valciukas (1991) notes that the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
case-control approach is the strategy of choice when no other environmental or biological 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
indicator of neurotoxic exposure is available. He further states: ``Considering the fact that 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
for the vast majority of neurotoxic chemical compounds, no objective biological indicators of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
exposure are available (or if they are, their half-life is too short to be of any practical value), 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the case-control paradigm is a widely accepted strategy for the assessment of toxic 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
causation.'' The case-control study design, however, can be very susceptible to bias. The 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
potential sources of bias are numerous and can be specific to a particular study, and will be 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
discussed only briefly here. Many of these biases also can be present in cross-sectional 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
studies. For example, recall bias or faulty recall of information by study subjects in a 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
questionnaire-based study can distort the results of the study. Analysis of the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
case-comparison study design assumes that the selected cases are representative persons with 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the disease_either all cases with the disease or a representative sample of them have been 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
ascertained. It further assumes that the control or comparison group is representative of the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
nondiseased population (or that the prevalence of the characteristic under study is the same in 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the control group as in general population). Failure to satisfy these assumptions may result 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
in selection bias, but violation of assumptions does not necessarily invalidate the study 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
results. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
An additional source of bias in case-control studies is the presence of confounding 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
variables, i.e., factors known to be associated with the exposure and causally related to the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
disease under study. These must be controlled either in the design of the study by matching 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
cases to controls on the basis of the confounding factor or in the analysis of the data by using 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
statistical techniques such as stratification or regression. Matching requires time to identify 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
an adequate number of potential controls to distinguish those with the proper characteristics, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
while statistical control of confounding requires a larger study. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The definition of exposure is critical in epidemiologic studies. In occupational 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
settings, exposure assessment is based on the job assignment of the study subjects, but can be 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
more precise if detailed company records allow the development of exposure profiles.
