The phrase 'sinking fund' has acquired a somewhat shameful ring for Britain
with a development in the small Danish town of Ulfborg-Vemb, in west
Jutland.
Its inhabitants still tell of the tragedy that befell the Royal Navy on the
nearby coast at Thorsminde in a fearful storm on Christmas Eve, 1811. In the
raging wind both Nelson's former flagship, the 98-gun St George, and the
74-gun Defence were driven ashore there, and broke up. Some 1,400 souls
perished, only 11 of the two ships' crews surviving, of whom one died within
24 hours of being rescued.
Since divers found the St George's wreck in 1969, marine archaeologists from
Rinmgkjobing Museum have supervised further explorations, recovering pieces
of British naval history by the thousand. To give them a home, Ulfborg-Vemb
has built a special museum.
Of the Pounds 600,000 cost, the township itself has contributed nearly a
third, the European Community has coughed up Pounds 80,000, and sponsors
have provided the rest. And Britain?
Well, the opening ceremony was performed by UK ambassador to Denmark Nigel
Williams, and the Royal Navy was represented at it by Commander Robert
Kirkwood, defence attache in Copenhagen. As for money, however, the Brits
have apparently not even contributed enough for a ha'porth o' tar.
