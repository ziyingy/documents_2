  Shenzhen's Wenjindu Customs cracked a drug-trafficking case 
on 11 January, the first of its kind in 1995. When conducting a 
routine border check on a Hong Kong truck bearing the name of a 
Shenzhen transportation company, customs investigators found 
that the cargo area of the truck was empty, with the exception 
of a travelling bag behind the driver's seat. When the 
officials started to examine the bag, the driver jumped out of 
the truck in an unsuccessful attempt to escape. When the bag 
was opened, 40 bricks of heroin were found inside, weighing 
approximately 14 kg. The case is still under investigation.

  Kunming, January 17 (CNS) -- Police in Yunnan Province 
smashed 4,174 cases of drug trafficking last year, with 6,191 
criminals of Chinese or foreign nationality arrested. The 
official in charge of the provincial anti-narcotics office said 
that the police had seized 3,546 kg of refined drugs, including 
heroin, a rise of 11 percent, and 1,062 kg of opium, an increase 
of 57 percent over the previous year, while the number of cases 
solved last year was 14 percent up over 1992, with the number of 
suspects arrested rising by ten percent. The provincial 
authorities helped some 20,000 drug addicts get rid of their 
drug addiction. Yunnan was also involved in international 
cooperation against drug trafficking, including one supported by 
the United Nations which achieved a measure of success. The 
official added that the area under cultivation of opium poppy in 
the so-called Golden Triangle had increased in size in recent 
years. Drug trafficking from beyond the borders of Yunnan has 
imposed a direct and serious threat to the province because the 
infiltration of drugs into the province has become a serious 
problem. Yunnan will go further in strengthening its work in 
fighting drugs and will try its best to stop narcotics from 
flowing into the province. (Text) (Beijing ZHONGGUO XINWEN SHE
