Two of the most esoteric fields of science are joining in a marriage that could 
help determine whether the universe will go on expanding forever or ultimately 
collapse on itself in a final big bang. 
</P>
<P>
Physicists who are building a new generation of multimillion-dollar instruments 
to detect gravity waves are joining with astronomers who are trying to measure 
what may be immeasurable -- a subatomic particle so small it defies 
imagination, but so numerous that if it has even a little mass it may well 
determine the future of the universe. 
</P>
<P>
The marriage of these two very different fields could produce quality data that 
"we can really believe in," said UCLA professor David Cline, the prime mover 
behind the program. 
</P>
<P>
Most of the universe is believed to be made up of mysterious "hidden matter" 
that cannot be seen. Cosmologists speculate that if there is enough hidden 
matter, the force of gravity will be so great that the universe eventually will 
stop expanding and finally collapse. 
</P>
<P>
But what could be massive enough to cause the universe to ultimately contract, 
and yet still remain invisible? 
</P>
<P>
Some theorists believe the answer might lie in neutrinos, which are 
manufactured continuously when stars like the sun burn their fuel. Neutrinos 
are also created in great bursts when stars explode or collide. It was, in 
fact, just such an explosion that brought several dozen experts to Los Angeles 
last week for a symposium hosted by UCLA.

Discover Supernova 
</P>
<P>
Two years ago, an exploding star, called a supernova, was discovered in the 
southern sky, and it was the brightest supernova seen in 400 years, according 
to historical records. The discovery sent astronomers around the world 
scrambling for their instruments to witness one of nature's most spectacular 
shows, and it has spawned several major new areas of research because a 
supernova is one of nature's rarest laboratories, offering a view deep into the 
heart of the physics of the universe. 
</P>
<P>
Scientists who have studied the supernova have found that most of their earlier 
theories have stood the test well. Just as the theories suggested, the 
supernova has demonstrated that exploding stars produce the heavy elements that 
make up so much of the universe. 
</P>
<P>
More recently, scientists have discovered what they had expected to find at the 
center of the supernova, a spinning neutron star called a pulsar that sends off 
energy like a spinning lighthouse. But no one expected the pulsar to be 
spinning as rapidly as it apparently is: 2,000 times a second. 
</P>
<P>
That rapid spin rate is one of the bigger surprises in Supernova 1987A, which 
is in a nearby galaxy called the Large Magellanic Cloud, about 170,000 light 
years away. 
</P>
<P>
Equally important, however, was the discovery that the supernova was sending 
out neutrinos. In all, 20 neutrinos were detected in two large detectors, one 
in Japan and the other in Ohio. That alone was considered a significant 
achievement, since neutrinos do not have an electrical charge and thus are 
extremely difficult to capture. Trillions of them are constantly passing 
through the Earth without ever touching anything, but occasionally one collides 
with an atom in a neutrino detector, and the debris from that collision tells 
scientists something -- but not much -- about neutrinos. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Not Enough Data 
</P>
<P>
So while the detection of neutrinos from Supernova 1987A was somewhat of a 
triumph, the data gained was not adequate to determine whether neutrinos have 
enough mass to be significant in the cosmological question concerning the fate 
of the universe. 
</P>
<P>
And that set UCLA's Cline to thinking. Cline, who teaches both physics and 
astronomy, decided that if he could get the gravity wave physicists working 
with the neutrino astronomers, they might collectively solve one of the great 
problems of modern astronomy. 
</P>
<P>
The way to determine whether a neutrino has any mass is to figure out the speed 
at which it travels. If it has no mass, it would be a packet of pure energy, 
traveling at the speed of light. Even a slight mass would slow it a little. 
</P>
<P>
For Supernova 1987A, scientists tried to determine the speed of the neutrinos 
on the basis of the time of the sighting of the explosion. Since they arrived 
at Earth at virtually the same time as the visible light, the 20 detected 
neutrinos did not have enough mass to be significant. 
</P>
<P>
But all 20 of those were of one type, called electron neutrinos. There are two 
other types, called the muon and tau neutrinos, which are stronger candidates 
for having significant mass, and which were not detected from Supernova 1987A. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
New Detectors Planned 
</P>
<P>
More-sensitive detectors are planned for the years ahead, but even if muon and 
tau neutrinos can be detected, there remains the problem of determining how 
long it took them to get here. 
</P>
<P>
And that brought the gravity physicists and the neutrino astronomers together 
last week for the UCLA conference. 
</P>
<P>
A number of major gravity wave detectors are being planned around the world, 
including a $100-million joint project by Caltech and MIT that the National 
Science Foundation is expected to finance. The new detectors should be 
sensitive enough to detect gravity waves created by a supernova. 
</P>
<P>
In his General Theory of Relativity, Albert Einstein postulated that some 
events, such as colliding or exploding stars, would send out bursts of 
radiation in the form of gravity waves. That concept has become generally 
accepted among physicists, although no one has been able to prove it. The hope 
is that the next generation of gravity detectors, especially the one planned by 
Caltech and MIT, will be sensitive enough to detect them. 
</P>
<P>
Since gravity waves travel at the speed of light, the difference between the 
time that gravity waves are detected and the time that neutrinos are detected 
would offer a precise way of determining the mass of all three types of 
neutrinos. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Network of Detectors 
</P>
<P>
Cline and the other scientists who were at the UCLA symposium are trying to 
establish a framework for gravity wave detectors scattered around the world to 
work in concert with the equally scattered neutrino detectors. 
</P>
<P>
"We need to do it now," said Stanford University physics professor William 
Fairbank. "This could become a very exciting program." 
</P>
<P>
The neutrino detectors could be put on alert as soon as the gravity wave 
detectors report their first hits. That would ensure that all the data from 
that period would be preserved for future study. 
</P>
<P>
If the neutrinos arrive simultaneously with the gravity waves, as many 
scientists expect, that will rule them out as candidates for the "missing 
mass," and scientists can start looking for something else. If they arrive 
sometime later -- and that could even be a year later if the supernova is far 
enough away -- it will mean that these tiny, illusive elements will have the 
last word on the future of the universe. 
</P>
