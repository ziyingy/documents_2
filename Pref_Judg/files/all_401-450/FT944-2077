The financial crisis confronting the Church of England is of classic
Micawberish dimensions: rising spending and too little income. In 1992, the
Church cost about Pounds 600m a year to run, of which nearly half was taken
up by the stipends, housing and pensions of its 20,000 serving and retired
clergy. A further Pounds 200m went on worship and buildings. The C of E has
16,300 buildings, 400 of them listed grade 1.
The cost of pensions and retirement housing subsidy grew at nearly three
times the rate of inflation between 1981 and 1991 - from Pounds 18m to
Pounds 58m a year. The number of clergy pensioners rose by nearly a quarter
due to longevity and a sharp rise in early retirements.
The pensions bill will continue to rise far faster than inflation and
investment returns. Pensions are linked to earnings, not prices, and the
demographic profile of the clergy peaks late in the 50s. A large proportion
of women priests, and women set to be ordained, are in their 50s.
The C of E's central funding agency is the Church Commissioners, a statutory
body established in 1948 and responsible to parliament. The commissioners
amalgamated the assets - mostly farms and property ground rents, some dating
back to Henry VIII's dissolution of the monasteries - from two former
bodies. The cost of clergy pensions is met entirely by the commissioners,
who also have had to meet rising demands for the rest of the Church's work.
Their contributions to clergy stipends and housing subsidies rose from
Pounds 26m to Pounds 66m in the 1980s, and its grants to cathedrals from
Pounds 1.1m to Pounds 3.8m. The commissioners also have to pay compensation
to clergy resigning because of the ordination of women - estimated at well
over Pounds 11m.
The commissioners do not have the income to continue like this. Misguided
property investments late in the 1980s depleted their asset base (now Pounds
2.4bn, down from a peak of more than Pounds 3bn in 1989), and actuaries
advise that they are over-distributing income if the assets are to be
protected.
One report suggests that the commissioners need to draw about Pounds 20m a
year less in income than the Pounds 161m they drew in 1992 - yet, meeting
future pension liabilities requires an extra Pounds 30m a year on top of
that figure.
The commissioners cover more than a quarter of the Church's outgoings. Most
of the rest comes from the 13,000 parishes; in 1992, they raised two-thirds
of the C of E's income (Pounds 372m). Of 1.1m regular Church-goers, 400,000
gave covenants totalling Pounds 87m, raising Pounds 114m after the tax
refund (up, in constant prices, from about Pounds 27m in 1964); a further
Pounds 212m was raised through collections and other giving, and Pounds 40m
from parish investments.
A lot of the money raised in parishes is passed up to the 44 dioceses, which
are responsible - together with the commissioners - for paying and housing
the clergy. The dioceses, which have little money of their own, try to
equalise the burden on parishes by taking account of relative wealth and
size. Various measures are used. In Chelmsford - which stretches from the
edge of Suffolk, across London's commuter-land and into inner-city Newham -
census returns are the tool. Levies range from Pounds 16,000 for an inner
London parish with a congregation of 100, to Pounds 115,000 in a well-heeled
parish in the Basildon area with a congregation of 400.
Dioceses and cathedrals have their own endowments and trusts, raising Pounds
50m in 1992. They are distributed, unequally, between the old wealthy (such
as Oxford and Winchester) and the new poor (like Truro and Chelmsford).
Were the 'funding gap' of Pounds 50m to be met by the parishes, the
proportion of the C of E's budget raised locally would rise to about 75 per
cent, further changing the balance of financial power within the Church away
from the centre and towards the parishes.
