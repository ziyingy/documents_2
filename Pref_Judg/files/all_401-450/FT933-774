CITY councils throughout northern Italy have begun to assess the damage
caused by three days of exceptionally heavy rains that left at least six
people dead.
The main areas affected have been Liguria, Lombardy, Piedmont and Valle
d'Aosta. Although the bad weather began to clear yesterday, there was still
serious disruption to road and rail transport.
The worst affected area has been Genoa, where initial estimates have
suggested as much as L1,000bn (Pounds 414m) worth of damage has been done to
infrastructure and buildings. This has prompted moves to have the government
declare Genoa and parts of Liguria a disaster area.
Local government officials and politicians in Genoa were criticised
yesterday for failing to implement adequate flood control measures. The city
backs against steep mountains and the small river channels are easily
blocked or overflow. Traders have planned a demonstration on Thursday.
One of the last of the persons most wanted by Milan magistrates in their
corruption investigations has handed himself in. Mr Aldo Molino, a
Neapolitan-born finance expert, handed himself over at Milan airport on
Sunday after being wanted for four months for questioning on a series of
corruption charges involving some L17bn.
Mr Molino's name has been linked to inquiries into the alleged illicit
financing of political parties by ENI, the state oil company, as well as to
the activities of the Ferruzzi group. He is also believed to be wanted for
questioning in an inquiry into misuse of EC funds for restructuring the
steel industry.
