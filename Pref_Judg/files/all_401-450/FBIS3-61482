  [Abstract] Research on the reaction of ground water to 
disturbances caused by underground nuclear explosions was 
carried out during the period 1983-1989 using data from 96 
observation holes in the Semipalatinsk test range at distances 
0.3-10 km from the epicenter. The observations were made at the 
time of 44 underground nuclear explosions (29 in deep holes and 
15 in drifts) with a TNT equivalent from 6 to 150 kilotons. A 
change in hydrogeological conditions was caused by a change in 
the mechanical state of the rocks. The greatest change in water 
conductivity was observed in the neighborhood of holes 
containing the least water. In holes penetrating andesitic 
porphyries there was an average increase in water conductivity 
from 0.26 to 0.52 m[.sup]2[/]/day, corresponding to an 
increase in total rock porosity from 3.8 to 5.3%. An 
underground nuclear explosion results in disruption of natural 
hydrogeological conditions in a region with a relative radius 
r/q[.sup]1/3[/] to 1000 m/kt[.sup]1/3[/], which is greater 
by an order of magnitude than the radius of the zone of 
fracturing induced during an explosion and which corresponds to 
the zone of irreversible local disruptions of the medium. 
Changes in hydrogeological conditions were caused by: an 
increase in the effective pressure of the fluid in water-bearing 
rocks; a change in the mechanical, and therefore, the filtration 
properties of reservoir rocks; formation of new filtration 
channels; formation of underground voids as a result of an 
explosion and their subsequent filling with ground water.
