<P>
Freshly felled trees lay like match sticks on the hill overlooking Windfall 
Lake, a small, clear jewel that brims with cutthroat trout and once was flanked 
by towering stands of Douglas fir. 
</P>
<P>
To Forest Service managers, the 35-acre timber sale was a routine part of 
business in the Willamette National Forest, a sprawling, New Jersey-sized 
preserve that is the largest timber producer in the United States. 
</P>
<P>
But to Forest Service wildlife biologist Ken Kestner, it was a mistake. Last 
summer, Kestner identified the area as the "center of activity" for a pair of 
northern spotted owls -- a rare, nocturnal species uniquely dependent on the 
Northwest's virgin forests -- and recommended against the cutting. 
</P>
<P>
"I would assume that whatever tree they used for nesting has probably been 
harvested out," Kestner said while touring the site recently. "I see it as 
making a significant impact." 
</P>
<P>
The division within the Forest Service is symptomatic of the broader debate 
over the future of the Northwest's dwindling ancient forests, a mountainous, 
fog-shrouded realm that stretches from Northern California to British Columbia. 
</P>
<P>
The controversy entered the national political arena after lawsuits by 
environmental groups on behalf of the spotted owl limited timber sales 
throughout the Northwest, prompting loud protests from logging towns and the 
timber industry. 
</P>
<P>
But the compromise that emerged from Congress in September was only a yearlong 
stopgap, leaving unresolved basic questions with profound implications for 
national forest policy, the environment and the economy of the Pacific 
Northwest. 
</P>
<P>
On one side are the multibillion-dollar wood-products industry and hundreds of 
towns that depend on the timber harvest for their economic lifeblood. On the 
other are environmentalists, many scientists and a mounting body of evidence 
that "old-growth" virgin forests play a key role in the maintenance of wildlife 
populations, soil quality and biological diversity. 
</P>
<P>
Because the forests make up the last remnants of temperate rain forests in the 
continental United States, the debate has also assumed international 
significance in light of U.S. efforts to curb the destruction of rain forests 
in Brazil and elsewhere in the Third World. 
</P>
<P>
Although Northwest forests are replanted or grow back on their own, scientists 
say that generations will pass before they assume the characteristics of those 
they replaced. 
</P>
<P>
"Besides the aesthetic value, old-growth forests represent a reservoir of 
biological diversity and nutrient recycling that is essentially irreplaceable," 
said C. J. Ralph, a Forest Service research ecologist. 
</P>
<P>
Concentrated for the most part in 12 national forests on the western slope of 
the Cascades, these giant evergreen stands of spruce, hemlock and Douglas fir 
-- some more than 500 years old and taller than a 30-story building -- once 
covered an estimated 19 million acres. 
</P>
<P>
Today scientists say only 2.5 million to 3.5 million acres of old-growth timber 
remain and that is disappearing at the rate of 67,000 acres a year. About 
900,000 acres are permanently protected in parks or wilderness areas. 
</P>
<P>
Environmentalists have tried for years to slow the logging in the Northwest, 
but they acquired the mechanism to do so only after the U.S. Fish and Wildlife 
Service agreed to consider listing the spotted owl as an endangered species. 
</P>
<P>
Under intense pressure from logging interests, members of the Northwest's 
congressional delegations fashioned a compromise that forced environmentalists 
to lift some of the injunctions in exchange for reducing the overall timber 
harvests for 1989 and 1990. 
</P>
<P>
Contrary to assertions by some politicians that the lawsuits had shut down 
mills throughout Oregon, the injunctions will not have a significant impact 
until next year. 
</P>
<P>
That is because the injunctions blocked timber sales, which typically take 
place a year or two in advance of harvesting, and loggers are still cutting 
trees from timber purchased in 1988 or before. 
</P>
<P>
"The cutting is going on fiercely," said Mike Kerrick, supervisor of the 
Willamette. "The market's been real hot." 
</P>
<P>
Timber industry spokesmen assert that further restrictions will jeopardize jobs 
and communities. Moreover, they say, adequate amounts of old-growth timber 
already are protected in parks and wilderness areas, while modern forestry 
practices ensure a sound environment in harvested forests. 
</P>
<P>
"It isn't an all-or-nothing situation," said Chris West, a forester with the 
Northwest Forestry Assn., an industry group. "We may not have as many spotted 
owls, but the biological diversity will be there." 
</P>
<P>
Although the matter is far from settled, few people expect the record harvests 
of recent years to persist. The Forest Service is preparing long-term 
management plans for the Northwest, and officials have indicated that 
old-growth and spotted owls will figure prominently in the calculations. 
</P>
<P>
Last month, Associate Chief George Leonard announced that the service had 
adopted a policy that would preserve about half the remaining unprotected old 
growth in the Northwest. 
</P>
<P>
Environmentalists were skeptical, noting that the Forest Service has yet to 
decide precisely which forests fall into the category. 
</P>
<P>
Nevertheless, even the agency's harshest critics concede that the Forest 
Service's traditional focus on timber production is changing. Publicity 
brochures emphasize recreation and wilderness, not tree farms. More 
significantly, pesticide use is down, and loggers often are required to leave 
branches and other tree remnants for the benefit of soil and wildlife. 
</P>
<P>
"We are very capable of altering our management systems to protect more of the 
kinds of ecological values associated with old growth," said Jerry Franklin, 
the service's chief plant ecologist and a frequent critic of past logging 
practices. "Right now the rate of change is just breathtaking. And it's very 
hard to see where it's going to end." 
</P>
<P>
Perhaps nowhere are competing pressures more acute than in the 1.7-million-acre 
Willamette, which sprawls across Oregon's western Cascades like a giant throw 
rug. 
</P>
<P>
Like other national forests in the Northwest, the Willamette remained largely 
undisturbed until the postwar building boom. Even now, "scenic buffers" along 
major roads shield many logged-over areas from public view. 
</P>
<P>
But from the air can be seen a checkerboard of bald hillsides and mountains 
laced with logging roads. Spotted owls and environmentalists notwithstanding, 
timber still drives the regional economy and accounts for 85% of the 
Willamette's management budget, according to Kerrick. 
</P>
<P>
About 500,000 acres of old-growth remain in the Willamette, and 90,000 of that 
has been permanently protected as designated wilderness. Management plans call 
for setting aside an additional 207,000 acres for at least the next 15 years, 
Kerrick said. 
</P>
<P>
"The environmental community would have you believe that the last of the 
old-growth is on a logging truck, and that's not the case," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Rangers such as Karen Barnett emphasize recreation -- hiking, rock-climbing, 
fishing, boating. "Sweet Home probably has more opportunities (for recreation) 
than other districts," Barnett said. "We have significant stands of old-growth 
left." 
</P>
<P>
But many government scientists remain concerned that the Forest Service's shift 
in priorities may come too late for some species, particularly the spotted owl. 
Some scientists estimate that a single pair of the rare nocturnal birds, which 
grow to about 15 inches tall, require about 4,000 acres of old-growth forest to 
ensure an adequate food supply. 
</P>
<P>
"If you cut down the old trees, you will drive the bird to extinction," said 
Charles Meslow, an Oregon State University professor of wildlife ecology who 
has studied the bird since 1975. 
</P>
<P>
Biologists estimate that the bird's population, now at about 3,000 pairs, is 
declining at the rate of 1% to 2% a year. 
</P>
<P>
But forest managers in the Willamette and elsewhere are still obligated to 
provide timber at the levels specified by Congress. As a consequence, they 
frequently find themselves at odds with their own biologists. 
</P>
<P>
The most recent conflict has occurred in Oakridge, a traditional Oregon timber 
town where local officials have been trying to diversify the economy through 
tourism. The effort got a boost last summer, when the local sawmill shut down 
after running out of timber on adjacent private lands. 
</P>
<P>
"Obviously, you can't sell yourself as a recreational paradise if you have no 
trees," City Administrator Wes Hare said. 
</P>
<P>
Last summer, Hare and the supervisor of the local recreation center, Norm 
Coyer, learned of the Forest Service plan to allow logging at Windfall Lake, 
their favorite trout fishing spot. "I've been to hundreds of lakes in this part 
of Oregon and I've never seen one quite like it," Coyer said. "It was a very 
special place." 
</P>
<P>
The two raised the matter with Kestner, the Forest Service biologist, who 
agreed that it should not be logged. Situated in a remote basin reached after a 
grueling scramble down a steep mountainside, the lake in reality is a tiny 
pond, formed when a natural landslide dammed a creek. 
</P>
<P>
With its high elevation and girdle of old-growth forest, the area constituted 
"a mini, little wilderness," Kestner said. Moreover, Kestner determined that 
the area was being used by a pair of spotted owls, although he was never able 
to find the nest. 
</P>
<P>
But the district ranger overruled his request, explaining that no "substitute" 
timber was available elsewhere. 
</P>
<P>
Kerrick said he is sympathetic to Kestner's concern but that a timber sale, 
once made, is very difficult to undo. "That's hard for biologists to accept," 
Kerrick said. 
</P>
