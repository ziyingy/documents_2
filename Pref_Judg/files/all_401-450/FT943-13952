Chic Simple's handbook* on spectacles is in no doubt about what is the most
important thing about them - 'remembering where you left them last'. True,
true. Even now I am lamenting my cool blue Calvin Klein shades - they sum up
everything that this year's sunglasses should be - and I have not the
faintest idea where I last left them.
The second most important thing is not, you may be dismayed to learn, the
shape of the frames, but how much protection they offer to the eyes. In
these ozone-depleted days most of us are only too aware of what excessive
sunlight can do to the skin but few of us are aware of just how much damage
we risk to the eyes.
Eye cancer, age-related cataract, age-related macular degeneration, ageing
and cancer of the circumocular skin, pterygium, photokeratitis - this is the
gloomy roll-call of eye problems that those who flirt dangerously with
strong sunlight might expect.
If this sounds a bit alarmist let me refer you to the work of optical
company Fabris Lane International.
'Damage to the eyes,' its eminent researchers, among them Professor Richard
Young of the University of California, conclude, 'is cumulative and
therefore it is better to wear protective sunglasses from an early age and
to continue through life to wear them whenever subject to bright sunlight
for extended periods.'
While UVA, B and C rays are harmful, the real baddie in the solar spectrum
is ultraviolet light and it is all the more dangerous for being invisible.
Cheap sunglasses bought off market stalls and in some chain stores are
little more than fashion accessories - but highly dangerous ones - for some
of the lenses are simply tinted and offer no protection.
Fortunately, it is usually very easy to check which glasses offer proper
protection and which do not - there is now a British Standard (2724), which
means that, at the very least, the eye will have basic protection.
Within that standard there are three different levels of protection - if for
use just as a fashion accessory (sashaying into Joseph, lunching in Le
Caprice, at Academy Awards, that sort of thing) then the lenses should
transmit between 29 per cent and 100 per cent of light (meaning that the
lens will get paler as the light gets darker).
Then there are sunglasses which transmit between 8 per cent and 29 per cent
of daylight and these are suitable for driving in strong sunlight.
Most protection of all is offered by those which transmit only between 3 per
cent and 8 per cent of light and these are not suitable for driving but are
intended for skiers, mountaineers and sailors.
Ray-Bans seem to survive the ups and downs of fashion's fickle favours. If
you own and wear a much loved pair you will clearly not be at the
cutting-edge of fashion but you will be able to rest assured that you are
wearing a classic. They have the enduring cachet of pearls and Chanel.
Last year's oblong frames, most fashionably done by Cutler &amp; Gross, are this
summer, says my style-adviser, very, very square. (Sod's law being what it
is, these will, of course, be the ones you have failed to lose.)
This year's look centres on thin metal frames, gently oval in shape which,
coincidentally and happily, seem to flatter most faces. Clip-ons (even for
those with 20/20 vision - they wear clip-ons over frames with plain glass)
are what the really cool set is wearing.
This is one of those splendid turns of the wheel of fashion - when clip-ons
first came in they were strictly for the geriatric set, a reminder of the
passing of time and the withering of age.
Now what once was naff has become big business with even some of those who
normally wear contact lenses abandoning them for the summer in favour of
prescription lenses and clip-ons.
Calvin Klein does clip-ons with different coloured lenses - normally Pounds
140 for the frame (currently Pounds 105 in Selfridge's summer sale) and
Pounds 40 for the clip-ons. Emporio Armani, too, is rushing in vast
quantities of its little metal frames and clip-on attachments.
Anglo-American is one of the great names in what the trade calls 'eye-wear'.
Initially famous for its horn-rimmed glasses, made from zylonite and
cellulose nitrate in imitation tortoise-shell, and given clout among the
glamour set when Harold Lloyd and Buster Keaton took to wearing them, they
have long been established as one of the first places of call for those who
would be both safe and fashionable.
Anglo-American has added proper optically-sophisticated sunglasses,
including Grade 1 optical quality plastic lenses and impact resistant
organic glass, to a wide range of frames.
It has some 10 different frames with clip-ons which exactly match the frame
in metal and four in acetate. Frames start at Pounds 60 and its clip-ons are
Pounds 45 to Pounds 49.
If your summer is going to include lots of energetic sporting activities
then you should look out for Fabris Lane's Etalia Sports range which uses
polycarbonate safety lenses of great strength.
Fabris Lane also offers other specialist lenses - Advanced Graphite Driving
lenses (blocks ultra-violet light completely) yet retains good visibility
and polarised lenses which eliminate up to 90 per cent of the glare
reflected from flat surfaces such as the sea, snow and wet roads.
Those who are unaccustomed to the kind of prices designer frames tend to
attract might like to look at the Mazzucchelli range. It does for sunglasses
what Warehouse and Miss Selfridge do for fashion - delivers the latest
designer look at a fraction of the designer price.
For just Pounds 22.50 there is pair of the slightly oval, thin metal-framed
frames with good protective lenses which have all this summer's fashionable
hallmarks.
*Thames and Hudson, Pounds 6.95.
