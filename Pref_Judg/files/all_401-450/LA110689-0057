One of six pregnant U.S. women fails to receive proper prenatal care, and wide 
differences exist in the quality of care offered to expectant mothers across 
the nation, according to a report released last week. A study by the Alan 
Guttmacher Institute found that about 16% of all women who give birth do not 
begin prenatal care until their fifth month or make fewer than half the number 
of visits recommended by medical experts.

In addition, the report found that as of the mid-1980s, only 1% of U.S. 
counties met the federal goal of at least 90% of mothers starting prenatal care 
in their first three months. The report by the New York-based nonprofit group 
found that inadequate care is highest among teen-age, unmarried and minority 
women -- groups who generally are at higher risk for low birth-weight and 
premature babies.

One-third of teen-age mothers and one-third of unmarried mothers received 
inadequate care, about double the rate for all women, the researchers found. In 
addition, 32% of Indians, 30% of Latinos and 27% of blacks got poor prenatal 
care, compared with 13% of whites and Asians.
