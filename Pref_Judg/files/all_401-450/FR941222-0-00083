One comment asked why the requirements of &sect;6.8(c) apply only to ``carbonated beverages in containers'' as opposed
to all beverage containers. The rule does not propose to go beyond 40 CFR part 244. Regulations at 40 CFR part 244 require
deposit systems only for containers holding ``carbonated beverages.''

One comment asked if this section applies the penalties to solid waste disposal sites on ``private inholdings.''
The answer is yes, 36 CFR part 6, including its penalty provisions, applies to solid waste disposal sites on nonfederal
lands, insofar as such lands are within the boundaries of a unit of the National Park System.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The regulations are generally applicable to any solid waste disposal site operated in, or proposed for operation
in, units of the National Park System. While the NPS is concerned with the disposal of all solid wastes on all lands and
waters within unit boundaries, the rule provides for certain exceptions. This final rule at &sect;6.2(c) does not
require that all persons who either reside or farm within the exterior boundaries of a National Park System unit submit
a request and obtain a permit from the Regional Director for the disposal of residential or agricultural wastes on
their lands. Paragraph (c) provides that a person residing within the boundaries of a unit of the National Park System
may dispose of certain solid wastes without a permit or penalty unless the person requires a State or local permit or
license to dispose of solid waste. The final rule enumerates conditions under which such persons may dispose of waste.
This exemption does not apply to the disposal of agricultural pesticides, pesticide equipment or containers.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
This exception is intended to minimize the solid waste stream by providing an alternative disposal means for agricultural
or residential solid wastes that are compostible.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
If the Superintendent of the affected unit determines that the disposal of agricultural or residential solid wastes
poses a reasonable probability of threat to public health or the environment, as described in the regulations at 40
CFR part 257, the Superintendent will notify the Regional Director and the resident that the request, permit, and
penalty provisions of 36 CFR part 6 are applicable.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Paragraph 6.2(d) explains the effect of the regulations on NPS operated sites. Existing and new solid waste disposal
sites operated or proposed by the NPS for administration of the National Park System must meet the standards prescribed
in 40 CFR subchapter I, specifically at 40 CFR part 241, Guidelines for the Land Disposal of Solid Waste; part 257, Criteria
for Classification of Solid Waste Disposal Facilities and Practices, and part 258 Criteria for Municipal Solid Waste
Landfills, and by appropriate State laws. The permit, administrative, financial assurance and penalty provisions
of the final rule do not apply to NPS operated landfills. However, the NPS will adhere to the conditions of &sect;6.4
to establish a new, or expand an existing, solid waste disposal site for NPS activities. The NPS will also adhere to
the conditions of &sect;6.5 to continue operations at existing NPS operated solid waste disposal sites. In addition,
the NPS will comply with the National Environmental Policy Act (42 U.S.C. 4321, 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
et seq.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
) and, at a minimum, prepare an environmental assessment for any new, or expansion of any existing, solid waste disposal
site that the NPS proposes.

Section 6.3&blank;Definitions
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The definitions section of the rule applies to terms that are not otherwise defined in 36 CFR part 1. The words defined
in the rule either come from the legislation on which the rule is based or are included to enhance the clarity and accuracy
of the rule. The primary purposes of the definitions are to make clear the reach and applicability of the rule for the
NPS and the regulated community and to ensure that actions taken under the rule are consistent and predictable. In
most cases, other statutes serve as the bases for the precise wording selected. These statutes are referred to in the
discussions of the definitions.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The term ``boundaries'' of any unit of the National Park System comes from the language of the statute. It is defined
in the final rule to include all lands within units of the National Park System, regardless of jurisdictional status
or ownership. Many units of the National Park System include nonfederal lands. Solid waste disposal on both Federal
and nonfederal lands within National Park System unit boundaries come under the purview of this rule.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Because there are no limitations on applicability to any class or type of lands in the statutory language, the rule
defines the term broadly. The definition includes waters as well as lands because of the breadth of the statutory language
and because the effects of such solid waste disposal sites are not limited to lands, but can also affect waters, particularly
groundwater.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The final rule adds a definition for the term ``compostible materials.'' The Service determines that facilities
for the management of compostible materials are not solid waste disposal sites for the purpose of these regulations.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Also defined is the term, ``National Park Service activities.'' It is explained for two reasons: First, to clarify
that there must be a necessary connection between the NPS and the establishment of solid waste disposal sites after
the passage of the Act; second, beginning one year after the effective date of the regulations, only persons engaged
in ``National Park Service activities,'' as defined herein, may dispose of solid waste in an NPS operated solid waste
disposal site. ``National Park Service activities'' thus includes activities conducted by NPS contractors, concessionaires
and commercial use licensees. Such persons, under agreement with the NPS, provide eating, lodging, transportation
and other services to park visitors. Since new solid waste disposal sites may be established in National Park System
units for NPS activities only, new sites may accept for disposal waste generated only by these persons. NPS contractors,
concessionaires, and commercial use licensees may also dispose of solid waste in existing NPS operated sites. ``National
Park Service activities'' do not include activities engaged in by Special Use Permittees (Form 10&hyph;114). Waste
disposal by Special Use Permittees and others is governed by all the substantive, permit, financial assurance and
penalty provisions of &sect;6.4 for a new waste disposal site, or &sect;6.5 for an existing site.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The word ``degrade'' also comes from the statute and is defined as ``to lessen in quantity, quality, or value.'' It
is included in the terms defined in the rule for the sake of clarity and predictability. Since the statutorily mandated
standard for any solid waste disposal site operating in a park unit is that the operation not ``degrade'' park resources,
this section provides guidance as to how the term degrade is to be used by the NPS in determining such effects.
