Section 10305(d) of OBRA 1989 amended section 223(g)(2)(B) 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
of the Act to require that the Secretary take into account any 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
physical, mental, educational, or linguistic limitations an 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
individual may have (including any lack of facility with the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
English language) in determining whether an individual's appeal 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
is made in good faith. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Based on this amendment and the amendment to title XVI of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the Act made by section 10305(e) of OBRA 1989, we are amending 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
&sect;&sect;404.1597a(j)(3) and 416.996(g)(2) to provide that we will take 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
into account any physical, mental, educational, or linguistic 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
limitations (including any lack of facility with the English 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
language) the individual has in determining whether the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
individual acted in good faith in pursuing the appeal.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Section 10305(e) amended section 1631(c)(1) of the Act to 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
provide that the Secretary shall specifically take into account 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
any physical, mental, educational, or linguistic limitations of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
an individual (including any lack of facility with the English 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
language) in determining, with respect to the eligibility of the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
individual for benefits under title XVI, whether the individual 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
acted in good faith or was at fault, and in determining fraud, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
deception, or intent. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The changes we are making in part 416 of the regulations in 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
connection with the administrative review process are based on 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the amendment to section 1631(c)(1). We are making comparable 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
changes in part 404 in the interest of consistency. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Our current regulations provide that a determination or 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
decision which we make about an individual's rights under title 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
II or title XVI of the Act is generally final and binding unless 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the individual files a request for review of the determination or 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
decision within a specified time period. However, the time 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
period to request review will be extended if good cause can be 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
established for missing the deadline to request review 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(&sect;&sect;404.911 and 416.1411). Also, under our regulations, we may 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
reopen a determination or decision at any time if it was obtained 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
by fraud or similar fault (&sect;&sect;404.988(c)(1) and 416.1488(c)), or, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
in title II cases, if certain other circumstances exist 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(&sect;404.988(c)). 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Under our regulations, a request for a hearing before an ALJ 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
may be dismissed if neither the person requesting the hearing nor 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
his or her designated representative appears at the time and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
place set for the hearing. However, if good cause for failure to 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
appear can be established, the hearing request will not be 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
dismissed (&sect;&sect;404.957(b) and 416.1457(b)). 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
We are making the following changes to &sect;&sect;404.911, 404.936, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
404.957, 404.988, 416.1411, 416.1436, 416.1457, and 416.1488 to 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
reflect the consideration of the factors described in section 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
10305 of OBRA 1989. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
&bull;Amend &sect;&sect;404.911(a) and (b)(9) and 416.1411(a) and (b)(9) to 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
provide that in determining whether an individual had good cause 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
for missing a deadline to request review, we will take into 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
account any physical, mental, educational, or linguistic 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
limitations of the individual (including any lack of facility 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
with the English language) which may have prevented the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
individual from filing a timely request or from understanding or 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
knowing about the need to file a timely request for review. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
&bull;Amend &sect;&sect;404.936 and 416.1436 to further describe 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
circumstances which an individual, who will not be represented at 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
a hearing before an ALJ, may give for requesting a change in the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
time or place of the hearing. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
&bull;Amend &sect;&sect;404.957(b) and 416.1457(b) to require that in 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
making determinations of whether an individual had good cause for 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
failure to appear for a hearing before an ALJ, we will take into 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
account any physical, mental, educational, or linguistic 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
limitations (including any lack of facility with the English 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
language) the individual has.
