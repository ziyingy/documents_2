Most local education authorities are failing in their duty to police child
labour, and their regulatory responsibilities should be transferred to
environmental health departments, a report says.
The report, delivered at a conference of the International Association of
Labour Inspection in Tunisia, may embarrass the government among its
European partners.
The government has met European Union resistance to its attempt to secure a
four-year opt-out from a directive controlling the number of hours that
children can work. It believes the European law, which forbids children
under 15 from working more than 12 hours a week, would interfere with
newspaper rounds.
The survey by Ms Michele Baron, a senior environmental health officer
attached to the Health and Safety Executive, sampled 15 per cent of local
education authorities. She found six out of 10 treated applications for
children's work permits from employers as an administrative exercise and did
nothing to enforce child labour laws by checking on working conditions.
'They have all made by-laws under the relative acts, but the extent to which
they enforce them varies depending on the available resources,' said Ms
Baron.
'Local authority environmental health inspectors are in a better position to
undertake this work.
'They are regularly inspecting the places where children work and have more
resources to devote to this area,' she said.
The report emerges amid increasing concerns among British labour
organisations about the extent of illegal child labour. Last month five
children were discovered working at a clothing factory in Preston,
Lancashire. Usdaw, the shopworkers' union, has estimated that more than 2m
children do illegal part-time work in the UK and the Labour party produced
figures recently which recorded 39 work-related deaths among
16-to-19-year-olds in the UK since 1990.
Ms Baron's survey coincides with a study carried out by the Scottish Low Pay
Unit which found widespread abuse of child-labour laws among three schools
it surveyed in Dumfries and Galloway.
More than a third of the 259 pupils surveyed were working and the majority
of them worked beyond the time limits laid down in law.
The children were working an average of 8.5 hours a week and drew average
weekly earnings of Pounds 13. One child was working a 39-hour week as well
as attending school.
Fewer than a quarter of the pupils had possessed a work permit. The report
also found that children who had never worked were likely to have better
results in English examinations, though mathematics results appeared
unaffected.
Ms Baron said: 'Enforcing the laws properly and decreasing the amount of
illegal child labour in the UK would increase the amount of work available
for adults. I am not advocating more regulations but more effective
inspection techniques.'
The IALI is a body established by the International Labour Organisation to
promote better international labour controls.
