Question: It seems that I've been trying to lose weight all my life but I 
haven't had much luck with the usual diet. I believe that I could stick to 
almost any kind of diet, no matter how unpleasant, if I knew it would only last 
a few weeks.

I understand there's a very low-calorie diet that could bring about a 
substantial loss of weight within a short period of time. Is there any reason 
from a medical standpoint that such a diet would not be advisable? I should add 
that being heavy isn't advisable either.

Answer: Very low-calorie diets may have serious short- and long-term health 
consequences. Short-term risks include dehydration and cramps; long-term risks 
include cardiac problems.

<P>
Very low-calorie diets should be used only by people who are severely 
overweight and only under medical supervision. I strongly advise that you speak 
with your physician before undertaking such a diet on your own. You might want 
to ask him to recommend a safe and effective diet supplement.
