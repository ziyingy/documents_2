  [Text] Yesterday in Vientiane, a meeting took place 
between the Lao National Committee for Control and Suppression 
of Narcotic Drugs [LNCCSND] and a high-level delegation of the 
U.S. Government. The Lao People's Democratic Republic [LPDR] 
was represented at the meeting by Souban Salitthilat, deputy 
foreign affairs minister and chairman of the LNCCSND, while the 
U.S. side was led by Richard Lee Brown, director of the U.S. 
Office of National Drug Control Policy [ONDCP] attached to the 
U.S. presidential office. 
  At the meeting, the two sides reviewed achievements made by 
the Lao and U.S. Governments in implementing a project designed 
under the memorandum of understanding on cooperation in narcotic 
drugs issues signed by the two countries on 30 September 1989. 
The spirit of the memorandum has so far been translated into a 
comprehensive rural development project launched in Meuang Son 
District, Sam Neua Province, aimed at reducing production and 
trafficking in narcotic drugs. Since 1990, the Lao side's task 
force has seized 905 kilos of opium, 155 metric tons of 
marijuana, and over 34 kilos of heroin. Also, the Lao side 
officially set up an office for the Committee for Control and 
Suppression of Narcotic Drugs on 20 May 1994. 
  The U.S. delegation arrived in Laos at noon on 7 June.
