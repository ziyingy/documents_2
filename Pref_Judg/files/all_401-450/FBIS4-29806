BFN 

  [Summary] An official at the Ministry of Industry, Mines, 
and Energy, has disclosed that by mid-June nearly 10 
garment-producing factories, among those that have submitted 
applications to do business, have started their operations. 
Companies investing in other sectors have not yet begun their 
operations. 
  According to the official, the reason for the garment 
factories' early start in operations is connected to the fact 
the Cambodia has been granted GSP [Generalised System of 
Preferences] and MFN [Most Favored Nation] status by 26 
countries in February and March. The countries most involved in 
this garment manufacturing sector are the PRC, Taiwan, and Hong 
Kong. Some of these countries have already set up factories, 
such as the case of Supreme Garment, June Textiles, Gold 
Kamvimex, and MSV International. The products of these 
factories are for export and include men's and women's clothing, 
sports garments, and winter clothing. Their markets include 
Britain, France, Denmark, Holland, Germany, and Austria. 
  The official also says that once Cambodia has been 
officially 
granted GSP status by the United States, it is expected that 
more companies from Taiwan and Hong Kong will set up garment and 
shoe factories. However, what holds these companies back is the 
fact that two or three years have already passed and Cambodia 
still does not have an investment law.
