  [Excerpts] Sofia, February 17 (BTA) -- According to 
Minister of Transport Kiril Ermenkov, the future West-East 
transport corridor is a very serious project and it has good 
prospects for development during the application of sanctions 
against ex-Yugoslavia. Mr. Ermenkov is taking part in the 
meeting of the transport ministers of Albania, Italy, Macedonia, 
Turkey and Bulgaria that opened today. The transport ministers 
gathered to consider the prospects for building the corridor. 
Starting from Italy's southern ports and crossing the Balkan 
countries, the transport corridor is expected to provide an 
alternative connection between Western and Central Europe on the 
one hand and the Middle east and the former Soviet republics on 
the other. [passage omitted] 
  The Black Sea port of Burgas is ready to take over the 
servicing of Macedonia's exports and imports, the Press Service 
of Port Burgas announced. The port authorities adopted the 
decision in connection with press reports that Greece had banned 
Macedonia from using the port of Thessaloniki for its commerce. 
All interested companies conducting trade with Macedonia can 
use the services of port Burgas, the announcement says.
