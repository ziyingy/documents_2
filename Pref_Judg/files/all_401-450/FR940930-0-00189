<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 -->
(a) Exhaust emissions from engines used in heavy-duty low emission vehicles shall meet one of the following standards:
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(1) Combined emissions of oxides of nitrogen and nonmethane hydrocarbons (or nonmethane hydrocarbon equivalent)
shall not exceed 3.8 grams per brake horsepower-hour.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(2) Combined emissions of oxides of nitrogen and nonmethane hydrocarbons (or nonmethane hydrocarbon equivalent)
shall not exceed 3.5 grams per brake horsepower-hour when tested (certified) on fuel meeting the specifications
of California certification fuel.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(b) Exhaust emissions from engines used in heavy-duty low emission vehicles shall meet conventional vehicle standards
set forth in Part 86 for total hydrocarbon, carbon monoxide, particulate, and organic material hydrocarbon equivalent.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(c) Exhaust emissions from engines used in ultra-low emission heavy-duty vehicles shall meet each of the following
standards:
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(1) The combined emissions of oxides of nitrogen and nonmethane hydrocarbons (or nonmethane hydrocarbon equivalent)
shall not exceed 2.5 grams per brake horsepower-hour.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(2) Carbon monoxide emissions shall not exceed 7.2 grams per brake horsepower-hour.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(3) Particulate emissions shall not exceed 0.05 grams per brake horsepower-hour.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(4) Formaldehyde emissions shall not exceed 0.025 grams per brake horsepower-hour.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(d) Exhaust emissions from engines used in inherently-low emission heavy-duty vehicles shall meet each of the following
standards:
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(1) The combined emissions of oxides of nitrogen and nonmethane hydrocarbons (or nonmethane hydrocarbon equivalent)
shall not exceed 2.5 grams per brake horsepower-hour.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(2) Carbon monoxide emissions shall not exceed 14.4 grams per brake horsepower-hour.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(3) Particulate emissions shall not exceed 0.10 grams per brake horsepower-hour.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(4) Formaldehyde emissions shall not exceed 0.05 grams per brake horsepower-hour.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(e) The standards set forth in paragraphs (a), (b), (c), and (d) of this section refer to the exhaust emitted while the
vehicle is being tested in accordance with the applicable test procedures set forth in 40 CFR part 86, subpart N.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(f)(1) A heavy-duty zero-emission vehicle (ZEV) has a standard of zero emissions for nonmethane hydrocarbons, oxides
of nitrogen, carbon monoxide, formaldehyde, and particulates.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(2) A heavy-duty vehicle shall be certified as a ZEV if it is determined by engineering analysis that the vehicle satisfies
the following conditions:
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(i) The vehicle fuel system(s) must not contain either carbon or nitrogen compounds (including air) which, when burned,
form nonmethane hydrocarbons, oxides of nitrogen, carbon monoxide, formaldehyde, or particulates as exhaust emissions.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(ii) All primary and auxiliary equipment and engines must have no emissions of nonmethane hydrocarbons, oxides of
nitrogen, carbon monoxide, formaldehyde, and particulates.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(iii) The vehicle fuel system(s) and any auxiliary engine(s) must have no evaporative emissions.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(iv) Any auxiliary heater must not operate at ambient temperatures above 40 degrees Fahrenheit.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(g) All heavy-duty engines used in low emission, ultra-low emission, or zero emission vehicles shall also comply
with all applicable standards and requirements of 40 CFR part 86, except that any exhaust emission standards in 40
CFR part 86 pertaining to pollutants for which standards are established in this section shall not apply.
