Orange County buildings, particularly newer structures, probably would fare 
well in a massive earthquake such as the temblor that struck Northern 
California last week, UC Irvine engineers who inspected the damage said 
Thursday.

Much remains to be done, however, to strengthen or buffer buildings in areas 
prone to liquefaction, and the cost of such reinforcement is too high for most 
residential property owners, the experts said during a news conference at UCI.

Liquefaction -- the churning of sandy soil during an earthquake that is likened 
to the action of a blender -- is a threat in some coastal areas of Orange 
County. Damage can be lessened by compacting or draining the wet soil or adding 
foundation and structural braces, according to the UCI engineers.

"It's a matter of economics, not technology," said Roberto Villaverde, an 
associate professor of civil engineering. Villaverde was one of a half-dozen 
UCI professors and doctoral candidates who studied the collapse of the Nimitz 
Freeway in San Francisco and building damage throughout the region as part of 
an investigation by the Earthquake Engineering Institute in El Cerrito.

"If we go to the homeowner and say, 'In order to have your house safe, you will 
have to spend thousands and thousands of dollars,' and they think the chances 
of an earthquake are small, they will say, 'No way,' " Villaverde said. 
"Overall, I believe that buildings here are more or less safe."

Public and commercial buildings built in the last decade or less are likely to 
hold up best in a severe quake because of constantly toughened state building 
requirements, said Robin Shepherd, head of UCI's reconnaissance team. 
</P>
<P>
"We know of no building that failed that was in compliance with the 1982 or 
1985 Uniform Building Code," Shepherd said. "The buildings that survived best 
were designed to the most recent code and faithfully executed by the 
contractor. We can learn from the errors and omissions which have shown up in 
San Francisco."

<P>
Despite more than 60 deaths and billions of dollars in damage, the devastation 
of Northern California was far less than the toll in a similar magnitude 
earthquake in Soviet Armenia a year ago. Shepherd said higher construction 
standards and greater preparedness helped the densely populated San Francisco 
region escape massive casualties.

"It's a success story for structural engineers," he said. "We are providing a 
higher level of seismic safety for less money."
