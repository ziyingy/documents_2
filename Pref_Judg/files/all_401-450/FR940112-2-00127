In its filing with the Commission, the self-regulatory organization included statements concerning the purpose
of, and basis for, the proposed rule change and discussed any comments it received on the proposed rule change. The
text of these statements may be examined at the places specified in Item IV below. The self-regulatory organization
has prepared summaries, set forth in Sections A, B, and C below, of the most significant aspects of such statements.

A. Self-Regulatory Organization's Statement of the Purpose of, and Statutory Basis for, the Proposed Rule Change

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=81 g=1 f=3 -->
1. Purpose 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
The purpose of the proposed rule amendments is to provide beneficial owners of stock with the ability to have investment
advisers registered under the Investment Advisers Act of 1940 who exercise investment discretion for their account(s)
pursuant to an advisory contract and who have been designated in writing by the beneficial owners to receive proxy
materials and to vote proxies on behalf of such beneficial owners. The proposed rule amendments will also allow the
designated registered investment advisers to receive annual reports and other related material. This would include
both member organizations of the NYSE and other entities registered as investment advisers. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Currently, Exchange rules prohibit a member organization from voting proxies, on a discretionary basis, on securities
held in its custody unless the securities are beneficially owned by the member organization, the beneficial owner
has failed to provide the member organization with voting instructions and the subject of the vote is nonsubstantive,
or the member organization is the investment manager for an ERISA account. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Further, Exchange rules require transmission of proxy and related issuer materials, as well as proxy voting instructions,
to each beneficial owner of stock held in the member organization's possession and control. Rule 451.60 explicitly
requires that proxy material be sent to a beneficial owner even though such owner has instructed the member organization
not to do so.
