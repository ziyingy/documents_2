    [Editorial Report] The following is a compilation of 
reports on economic activities in Brazil monitored through 16 
June. 
<H5>  PRODUCTION </H5>
  According to CNI, the National Confederation of Industries, 
Brazilian industrial sales dropped by 15.3 percent in April 1994 
in comparison with the previous month, and by 11.4 percent in 
comparison with April 1993, the greatest such slip recorded by 
CNI since it began operations in 1992. CNI economists believe 
that the strong decline in sales is due to the conversion of the 
economy into real value units, URV's, which has caused much 
uncertainty, and also to the government decision to maintain 
high interest rates, thus inhibiting consumption. As a 
consequence, installed industrial capacity dropped from 76.7 
percent in March to 74.8 percent in April. According to the Rio 
de Janeiro State Federation of Industries, Firjan, industrial 
production in Rio de Janeiro dropped by 6.4 percent during the 
January-May period in comparison with the same period last year.

  The Brazilian Institute of Geography and Statistics, IBGE, 
has reported that in February industrial production dropped in 
northeastern Brazil by 6.8 percent, while it increased by 5.5

Sao Paulo, industrial production has increased by 7.8 percent 
since the beginning of the year, and by 12.1 percent in the past 
12 months. This increase in Sao Paulo is due mainly to a 13.6

10.3 percent in mechanics, 27.6 percent in transportation 
materials, and a 9.4 percent increase in the chemical industry. 
Productivity nonetheless dropped by 14.5 percent in plastics,

study among 200 factories from 13 different industries, 
representing nearly 50 percent of employed labor in Rio de 
Janeiro State. (Sao Paulo AGENCIA ESTADO in Portuguese 2337 GMT

Brazilian exports amounted to $3.86 billion in May, which is 
32.35 percent greater than the same month last year. He said

<H5>  FOREIGN INVESTMENT </H5>
  Druing a seminar on the Argentine capital market and economy 
held on 8 June in Sao Paulo, Argentine National Securities 
Commission, CNV, Vice President Francisco Guilhermo Susmel 
announced that Argentine investment funds have been authorized 
to invest 100 percent of their assets in Brazilian shares. 
Argentine investment funds had previously been authorized to 
invest only 25 percent of their assets in foreign companies. 
Brazilian Securities and Exchange Commission, CVM, President 
Thomas Tosta de Sa reported that both the CNV and the CVM are 
working together to unify the rules for Argentine and Brazilian 
investment funds within the framework of the Common Market of 
the South. (Sao Paulo GAZETA MERCANTIL in Portuguese 9 Jun 94 p 
20) 
  The balance of foreign capital invested in Brazil, mainly in 
the stock exchanges, was $826.07 million in May, representing a 
90 percent increase in relation to April. This figure is the 
result of an inflow of $1.53 billion and an outflow of $706.08 
million. During the January-May period foreign capital inflow 
amounted to a total of $8.35 billion while outflow was $5.55 
billion, yielding a positive balance of $2.79 billion. These 
figures were released on 15 June by the CVM, which also reported 
that foreign investments were distributed in the following 
manner in Brazil: 67.91 percent in the stock exchange, 7.67 
percent in by-products, 16.07 percent in bonds, 8.39 percent in 
privatization papers, and 0.05 percent in Financial Investment 
Funds, FAF. By decision of the economic team, foreign investors 
have been forbidden from entering the money market since 
mid-1993. As for the origin of capital, 33.6 percent of the 
investments come from North America, 31 percent from Central 
America, 11.9 percent from South America, 22.2 percent from 
Europe, and 1.3 percent from Asia and Oceania. As for the 
investment institutions, in May 38.8 percent of these were 
banks, 31 percent brokers, 29.7 percent trusts and pension 
funds, and 0.5 percent non-profit financial institutions. 
According to the CVM, the largest net asset administrators are 
the following banks: Chase Manhattan Bank, Garantia, Citibank 
DTVM, Boston, Pactual, Itau, Economico CCVM, Matrix DTVM, and 
Unibanco. Three new investors were registered last month with 
their own funding portfolios, and two others in collective 
portfolios, increasing the number of investors operating in 
Brazil to 221 for those with their own portfolios and 166 for 
those who operate in collective portfolios. (Sao Paulo AGENCIA

<H5>  PRIVATIZATION </H5>
  On 14 June President Itamar Franco signed a provisional 
measure authorizing a loan of $11 million for the Lloyd 
Brazilian State Shipping Company, and providing for the 
implementation of an economic, financial, and operational 
streamlining of the company so that it can again be put up for 
auction in 90 days. Two auctions have already been held, but 
failed due to a lack of interested clients. The loan is meant 
to pay Lloyd's debts abroad, and for the release of two ships 
that are being withheld in the port of London. In the past four 
years the Brazilian Government has released $40 million to 
streamline the Lloyd company. According to the provisional 
measure, Lloyd should immediately sell for cash all the assets 
needed to repay its loans. The government is thus practically 
forcing Lloyd to sell one of its ships. The money collected 
from this sale must be deposited in the BNDES bank to the order 
of the Social and Merchant Navy Fund, where the funds for Lloyd 
were obtained. The two Lloyd ships must be auctioned on 17 
June. (Sao Paulo AGENCIA ESTADO in Portuguese 2330 GMT 13 Jun

  Ricardo Figueiro, chief of the National Privatization 
Program, has announced auction dates for eight subsidiary 
companies of the Camacari Petrochemical Complex. This means 
that the voting shares owed by Petrobras Chemical Corporation, 
Petroquisa, in the Northeastern Petrochemical Company, Copene, 
which is currently valued at $1.2 billion, will be auctioned 
next 24 August with a base price of $369 million. Petroquisa's 
shares in Acrinor and Coperbo will be the first to be auctioned, 
on 26 July, with a base price of $11 million and $23 million 
respectively. Then it will the turn of Petroquisa's shares in 
Nitrocarbono, with a base price of $23 million, which will be 
auctioned on 28 July; Politeno, with a base price of $40 
million, on 2 August; Ciquine and Polialden, with a base price 
of $21 and $15 million respectively, on 6 August; and EDN, with 
a base price of $9 million, on 11 August. Finally, Figueiro 
said that the Lloyd Brazilian State Shipping Company will be

<H5>  INFLATION </H5>
  The Getulio Vargas Foundation, FGV, has reported that prices 
in URV's are dropping. The General Price Index in URV's, which 
is called IGP 1-URV, dropped by 1.88 percent in May and by 0.09 
percent in April. The accumulated inflation in IGP 1-URV since 
the beginning of the year is 4.74 percent, and in the past 12 
months 13.94 percent. The Wholesale Price Index in URV's, IPA 
1-URV, dropped by 1.42 percent in April and by 3.73 percent in 
May. The IPA 1-URV has increased 0.81 percent so far this year. 
The Consumer Price Index in URV's, IPC 1-URV, increased by 0.56 
percent in May and 1.65 percent in April. So far this year the 
accumulated IPC 1-URV has increased by 7.67 percent. The 
National Construction Cost Index in URV's, INCC 1-URV, increased

<H5>  DOMESTIC SUPPLY </H5>
  The expectations created by the implementation of the real 
have led many cattle ranchers to leave their beef cattle in the 
pastures, making beef prices jump by 30.56 percent in 30 days. 
According to the Commodities and Futures Market, the price of 
one 32-pound arroba of beef in Sao Paulo increased from $15.29 
on 13 May to $21.34 on 13 June. The price in butcher shops of 
first and second class beef have increased by 85 and 135 percent 
respectively in the past 30 days. (Sao Paulo AGENCIA ESTADO in 
Portuguese 2246 GMT 13 Jun 94) 
<H5>  IMPORT TAXES </H5>
  The government has passed three provisions reducing the 
import taxes on three products. As of 1 July the import tax on 
all kinds of beef imports will be reduced from 10 percent to 
zero. According to Finance Ministry experts, the measure was 
adopted to safeguard a domestic supply problem and to prevent 
price increases now that the cattle slaughtering season is 
ending. The government also reduced the import tax on paper 
wrappings, craft paper, and cardboard from 10 and 15 percent to 
2 percent to counter recent unjustified price increases in the 
domestic market. The third provision benefits a single company, 
which imports a synthetic polyester fiber sponge to replace the 
domestically used steel sponge; the import tariff dropped from 5 
percent to zero. (Sao Paulo AGENCIA ESTADO in Portuguese 2310

<H5>  AGRICULTURAL LOANS </H5>
  The National Bank for Economic and Social Development, 
BNDES, 
has reported that it granted $175 million worth of financing to 
471 farming cooperatives between January 1991 and April 1994. 
Some of the loans granted by the BNDES were meant for: the 
Itambe Program to increase the milk cattle herds of 3,000 
farmers; the modernization of pork farms through the genetic 
improvement of the animals and productivity increases; the 
treatment of liquid wastes in keeping with environmental laws; 
and the installation of a vegetable oil extraction plant with 
the capacity to process 1,200 tonnes of soybeans in Guarapuava, 
Parana. (Sao Paulo AGENCIA ESTADO in Portuguese 2202 GMT 10 Jun 
94) 
<H5>  SAO PAULO CONSUMPTION </H5>
  According to the Sao Paulo Commerce Association and the Sao 
Paulo Commerce Federation, the consumption index in Sao Paulo 
dropped in May. Market experts are thus ruling out an explosion 
of consumption with the implementation of the real. According 
to the Sao Paulo Commerce Federation, food consumption dropped 
by 15.48 percent in April. It also reports that the Cost of 
Living Index, ICV, showed that prices, after being converted 
into URV's and reaching a peak increase, then dropped by 2.22 
percent during the 1 March to 15 April period. Jose Silvestre 
Prado de Oliveira, economist from the Inter-Union Department for 
Statistics and Socioeconomic Studies, Dieese, says he does not 
expect people to rush to the supermarkets with the 
implementation of the real, as happened with the Cruzado Plan, 
because, he said, "the minimum salary is currently worth half 
what it was worth in 1986, and purchasing power has thus 
diminished." (Sao Paulo AGENCIA ESTADO in Portuguese 2256 GMT 
13 Jun 94) 
<H5>  SAO PAULO REVENUES </H5>
  Tax collection has shrunk in the state of Sao Paulo, and 
will 
be very difficult to recover. One of the reasons for this is 
that new industries no longer choose to open there because of 
high costs, the fiscal battle among the less industrialized 
states, and changes in the law on Goods and Services Movement 
Tax, ICMS. In 1990 Sao Paulo collected $10.6 billion worth of 
ICMS; this dropped to $7.5 billion in 1993. In 1988 Sao Paulo 
collected 43 percent of the entire country's ICMS; this has 
fallen to 38 percent this year. Sao Paulo Finance Secretary 
adviser Clovis Panzarini said that Sao Paulo will hardly recover 
from the fiscal battle among states. (Sao Paulo GAZETA 
MERCANTIL in Portuguese 9 Jun 94 p 1) 
<H5>  REAL IMPLEMENTATION CAMPAIGN </H5>
  On 15 June Finance Minister Rubens Ricupero will officially 
launch the government campaign to inform the public about the 
implementation of the real currency. One of the measures is the 
implementation of a telephone hotline through which any citizen 
can obtain information on the changes that the new currency will 
make in people's lives, such as in paying bills next month. The 
10 Central Bank branches disseminated throughout the country 
will distribute 16 million leaflets and 1.4 million posters 
describing the main characteristics of the real among all 
commercial bank agencies, lottery houses, bus stations, and 
shopping centers. People will also be able to send free 
telegrams to the Central Bank asking questions about the real. 
The answers will be transmitted by the "Voz do Brasil" program 
on a national radio hookup. The Central Bank is also preparing 
5 million pamphlets with questions and answers about the real, 
which will be distributed on 26 June, and in the main Sunday 
newspaper editions as well. The Central Bank is also preparing 
special leaflets on the real for small businessmen. The campaign 
to explain the implementation of the real also includes 
interviews and programs that will be transmitted daily through 
the "Radiobras" national broadcasting network. (Sao Paulo
