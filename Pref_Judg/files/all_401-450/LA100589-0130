New genetic evidence has strengthened the claim that all humans alive today are 
descended from a single African woman and suggests that the woman lived 140,000 
years ago, not 200,000 as was previously believed, a UC Berkeley researcher 
said here Tuesday evening. 
</P>
<P>
Descendants of that woman, whom scientist have dubbed "Eve," started migrating 
north out of Africa 75,000 years ago and had fully settled in southern Europe 
35,000 years ago, displacing the indigenous Neanderthal population, said 
molecular biologist Allan C. Wilson. The Neanderthals were dispossessed because 
they were genetically incompatible with the humans of African origin, Wilson 
said at an international genetics conference. 
</P>
<P>
The new evidence also indicates that early males may have roamed rather freely 
throughout Africa nearly 100,000 years ago while females stayed firmly rooted, 
suggesting that sharp changes in cultural interaction of men and women occurred 
over a period of about 30,000 years.

Basis of Conclusions 
</P>
<P>
Wilson reached his conclusions by studying deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA, the 
genetic blueprint of humans) found not in the nucleus of cells, where most 
genes are stored, but in mitochondria, small bodies inside the cell that are 
the source of the cell's energy. Mitochondria have only 37 genes, compared to 
the estimated 100,000 found in the cell's nucleus, making them much easier to 
study. 
</P>
<P>
Unlike genes in the nucleus, which are inherited from both parents, genes in 
mitochondria are passed down only from mothers. Because of this, researchers 
can trace maternal lineages unaffected by contributions from males. 
</P>
<P>
Mutations in mitochondrial DNA are believed to occur at a constant rate over 
long periods of time. By studying the differences between mitochondrial DNA 
from two women, for example, researchers can determine how long ago they shared 
a common female ancestor. When many women are used, the technique also reveals 
where that ancestor lived. 
</P>
<P>
Using mitochondrial DNA from placentas, Wilson and his colleagues reported in 
1987 that all modern humans are descended from a woman who lived in southern 
Africa about 200,000 years ago, a woman who has subsequently become known as 
Eve or "the mother of us all." That finding does not mean that only one woman 
was alive then. Rather, it means that the lineages that descended from all 
other women eventually died out -- a phenomenon that is common in biology. 
</P>
<P>
By comparing every possible pairing among the 147 people tested in the study, 
the researchers concluded that Eve could only have lived in Africa. 
</P>
<P>
Although other researchers generally accept Wilson's methodology, they 
criticized two aspects of his studies: the fact that he used black Americans in 
his study as a surrogate for Africans, and the speed of his so-called 
"molecular clock." The molecular clock is a measure of the rate at which 
mutations occur in mitochondrial DNA, and critics charged that Wilson's was too 
fast, placing Eve too near us in time. 
</P>
<P>
In his current study, Wilson used newly developed biochemical techniques that 
allowed him to study the mitochondrial DNA contained in a sample as small as a 
single hair. Because he could use hairs, he was able to obtain specimens from 
two hunter-gatherer tribes in central Africa and from the !Kung bushmen of 
southern Africa, who would not have donated placentas for such a study. (The 
spelling of !Kung denotes a clicking sound in the pronunciation of the K.) 
</P>
<P>
He was also able to perform similar studies on chimpanzees, which helped him 
achieve a finer calibration of his molecular clock. 
</P>
<P>
"We have been able to refute both criticisms," Wilson told a meeting of 
geneticists. 
</P>
<P>
Based on the new data, he said, Eve lived in southern Africa 142,000 years ago. 
"We are all a derivative of one of the !Kung lineages," he said. 
</P>
<P>
The data further show that humans -- men and women together -- began migrating 
out of Africa into the Middle East about 75,000 years ago. By 35,000 years ago, 
they were firmly established in southern Europe, displacing the Neanderthals 
who had lived there. 
</P>
<P>
That agrees with archeological data, thereby confirming the accuracy of his 
molecular clock. The fact that Neanderthal women made no contribution to the 
gene pool indicates, he said, that a fundamental genetic incompatibility 
existed between the two groups. 
</P>
<P>
Although men and women began migrating out of Africa 75,000 years ago, men must 
have begun moving around and exploring the continent much earlier, he said. 
Evidence for this was provided by the genes of the three groups of African 
women. 
</P>
<P>
In those stages men did all the exploring and left women to tend to the home, 
whereas later the family group was clearly more important and migrated as a 
unit. 
</P>
<P>
Wilson found virtually no overlap in the mitochondrial DNA from the three 
groups, indicating that the females had stayed put for periods long enough for 
gene differences to develop -- many tens of thousands of years. To his 
surprise, however, Wilson found an almost complete overlap in key nuclear 
genes, which are inherited from both parents. 
</P>
<P>
"This means that during most of the time in Africa, our female ancestors moved 
very little, while the males apparently migrated quite a lot," he said.
