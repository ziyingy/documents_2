  [Text] The Capois Lamort Organization [OCL] of Franck 
Pierre asks the parliamentarians to make a ruling, to choose one 
of three resolutions resulting from the congresses and 
conferences held in the country recently -- that from the 
Committee of Actions for National Reconciliation, that from the 
Group of Citizens of the Greater North, and that from the 
private sector -- in order to achieve a happy way out of the 
crisis. 
  [Begin Pierre recording, in Creole] We in the OCL ask all 
conscientious and nationalistic parliamentarians to choose one 
of these three resolutions that can (?contribute) to the welfare 
of the Haitian people. We in the OCL ask that the Haitian Army 
-- in the event that the parliament cannot do its job of 
choosing one of the three resolutions -- go into action and form 
a military junta. That military junta should (?direct) the 
National Palace so it can manage the Haitian crisis and lead the 
country properly until elections are held. [end recording]
