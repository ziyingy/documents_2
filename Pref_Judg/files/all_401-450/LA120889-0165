Why do human beings drink? To quench thirst, to be sure. But also to stay alert 
or get drunk, to cool off or warm up, or to soothe a set of jangled nerves. 
</P>
<P>
Bodies need one primary thing from beverages: water. Every cell in our bodies 
contains water -- an aqueous stock that should be replenished daily. Water is 
mainly what we get from beverages, from seltzer to soda pop. 
</P>
<P>
Even most alcoholic and caffeinated beverages are primarily water, but we don't 
necessarily drink them to quench thirst. Nor could we: Caffeine has a diuretic 
effect. So does alcohol; it interferes with the "anti-diuretic hormone," 
stimulating urination. Diluted beverages such as iced tea or wine spritzers, 
however, may have so much water that they have a net quenching effect. 
</P>
<P>
What, then, are alcoholic and caffeinated beverages? You might say they are 
liquid drugs -- legal, socially acceptable, pharmacologically active. That 
makes their role in our lives a little more complicated than milk's. 
</P>
<P>
Caffeinated coffee is our society's primary legal stimulant, alcohol our 
primary legal depressant. Herbal teas often have proven pharmacologic actions, 
some therapeutic, some mood-enhancing. From gin to ginseng, we drink to feel 
good. 
</P>
<P>
Modest daily amounts of alcohol and caffeine can be safe, even beneficial. Two 
or three cups of coffee appear to be fine for most of us. These days, though, 
fears of alcohol are on the increase. In November, labels from the surgeon 
general -- warning about the risks of drinking while pregnant or driving -- 
began appearing on all alcoholic beverages. 
</P>
<P>
But despite these warnings, several studies show that alcohol can be healthful. 
If you control your drinking, and aren't pregnant, a glass or two of wine, a 
couple of beers, even two shots of rye, appear to be reasonable indulgences. 
</P>
<P>
Some doctors similarly advise us that a serving or two of alcoholic beverages a 
day might relax us, benefit the cardiovascular system and stimulate 
conviviality. Three or four a day, however, does damage; over time, it can 
kill. 
</P>

"At three or more drinks a day, you don't see adverse coronary effects, but you 
do see increases in high blood pressure, cirrhosis of the liver, throat cancer, 
accidents, hospitalizations and mortality," says Arthur L. Klatsky, chief of 
cardiology at Kaiser Permanente Medical Center in Oakland. For men with high 
blood pressure, for example, going from three drinks a day to none for one week 
may lower pressure. (The Surgeon General's Report on Nutrition and Health 
advises that even one drink is too much for pregnant women; alcohol consumption 
is associated with fetal abnormalities.) 
</P>
<P>
Alcohol can also kill quickly. Half the automobile fatalities and homicides, 
one-third of the suicides, as many as two-thirds of the drownings, and 
one-quarter of the burns, fires and falls in this country involve alcohol, says 
epidemiologist Mary Dufour of the National Institute on Alcohol Abuse and 
Alcoholism. 
</P>
<P>
Alcohol might also play a role in cancer, although no one is sure exactly what 
that role is. A Harvard study of more than 87,000 female nurses (the Nurses' 
Health Study) found that women who have more than one drink a day have a higher 
risk of breast cancer. A National Cancer Institute study found this link even 
at three drinks a week. 
</P>
<P>
A "meta-analysis" of 21 studies, conducted by Harvard School of Public Health 
researcher Matthew P. Longnecker, reveals that two drinks a day or more are 
associated with increased breast cancer risk, but at one drink a day, the link 
is weak. "If alcohol is a risk factor for breast cancer, it's a relatively 
modest risk factor," says associate professor David Klurfeld of the Wistar 
Institute in Philadelphia. 
</P>
<P>
Nevertheless, women at high risk for breast cancer -- for example, those with a 
strong family history of the disease -- may want to be especially careful, 
notes Klatsky. "A women should look at the role drinking plays in her life and 
make a decision," adds Boston University epidemiologist Lynn Rosenberg. 
"There's a lot to be said for women not drinking heavily for general health and 
well-being." 
</P>
<P>
What you drink, and in what context, can influence whether alcohol is a 
healthful part of your life, or a problem. In many cultures, drinking wine or 
beer with food is routine, and wine itself is a natural fermented agricultural 
product containing nutrients such as magnesium, calcium and potassium. 
</P>
<P>
Red wine provides 5% of the U.S. Recommended Daily Allowance for iron. Red wine 
might even offer some protection against cancer. It contains a substance called 
quercetin that, at least in the laboratory, strongly inhibits the growth of 
cancer cells, according to scientists at the University of California, 
Berkeley. 
</P>
<P>
Drinking a glass or two of wine with dinner or a beer after work is one of 
life's pleasures. But as a drug, alcohol is easy to abuse. 
</P>
<P>
"How a person handles alcohol is important," says Klatsky. "It's unhealthy to 
use alcohol as a drug, a sedative, a tranquilizer, or to drown one's troubles."
