Germany will make a special effort during its presidency of the Union next
year to strengthen the powers of Europol, the fledgling pan-European police
agency, to tackle organised crime. At a news conference after the summit,
Chancellor Helmut Kohl described organised crime as a 'cancer' spreading
through the EU. 'The need for intense co-operation between governments is
urgent,' he said.
During the summit, EU leaders approved a plan of action, drawn up by justice
and home affairs ministers last month, to reinforce the fight against drug
trafficking, money laundering and organised crime.
But although other leaders and the Belgian presidency only touched on the
issue in their briefings, Mr Kohl made a special effort to underline the
need for greater co-operation. He is known to have been disappointed that he
did not persuade his fellow leaders to insert more robust commitments on
international crime-fighting into the Maastricht treaty two years ago.
Europol, based in The Hague, is currently charged with co-ordinating the
European fight against drugs trafficking, but EU leaders agreed that a
special Union convention should be prepared by next October aimed at
broadening its responsibilities.
Mr Kohl said a pan-European approach was the best way to tackle such
cross-border problems, as regional and local police were unqualified to deal
with international crime.
As if to underline the difficulty of getting 12 member states to agree on
sensitive justice and interior matters, EU leaders were forced to note in
their communique Spain's objection on principle to implementation of common
EU action on asylum. Madrid is protesting about Belgium's sympathetic
treatment of two Spaniards suspected of links with Eta, the Basque terrorist
group. It wants to extradite the pair but last week a Belgian court freed
them pending investigation of their plea for political asylum.
