  [Text] The BMFT [Federal Ministry for Research and 
Technology] is providing about 270 million German marks up to 
1997 for development of new laser sources and applications. The 
new "Laser 2000" research focus is intended to speed up the 
generational change from tube (gas lasers) to semiconductor 
technology (diode lasers) in Germany. The main thrust of the 
program is: basic research for new generations of lasers, 
precision machining using lasers, new applications, and laser 
medicine. Work on the pilot project on high-power diode lasers 
has already begun with leading participation of Jenaoptik. 
According to Dr. Werner Gries of BMFT, the goal is to develop a 
small high-power, low-maintenance laser that is usable in a wide 
range of products.
