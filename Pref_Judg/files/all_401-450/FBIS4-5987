  [Text] Pyongyang, April 17 (KCNA) -- Yoshiyuki Oe, chairman 
of the Japan-Korea Friendship Data Centre and president of the 
S.B.B. Company, Ltd., of Japan, was interviewed by KCNA on April 
14. 
  Recalling that false reports on the nuclear issue of the 
Korean peninsula are set afloat, he said: 
  I consider the Nuclear Nonproliferation Treaty [NPT] unfair. 
  Because it is used to put pressure upon the countries which 
are trying to use nuclear energy for peaceful purposes, ahile 
closing its eyes to some nuclear weapon states including the 
United States. 
  The United States regards those countries which refuse to 
follow its will as enemy states and puts pressure on them. 
  Hence, it is not good. 
  The shipment of Patriot missiles into South Korea by the 
United States and its scheme to resume the "Team Spirit" joint 
military exercises of late are bringing the situation on the 
Korean peninsula to the extreme pitch of strain, driving it to 
the brink of war. 
  Such dangerous moves must be checked without fail.
