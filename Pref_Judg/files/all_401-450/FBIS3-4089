  [Text] Chongqing, March 23 (XINHUA) -- An advertising 
company has got the go-ahead to put up six huge boardings along 
the Chang Jiang River, in the Three Gorges where a huge dam is 
to be constructed. 
  Earlier this year, the waterways administration of the Chang 
Jiang River agreed to let the use of six signal stations in the 
Three Gorges to the Chongqing-based New Century Advertisement 
Company. 
  The signal stations were built at eye-catching positions in 
the Three Gorges to alert vessels at river bends. 
  When the Chang Jiang River is dammed in 1997 as planned, the 
first of the six signal stations will be submerged beneath the 
waters. The last will be flooded in the year 2003 when the 
first generating unit of the Three Gorges Power Station goes 
into operation. 
  An official of the New Century Company said they would 
choose 
six best-sellers in China's alcoholic drinks industry as their 
clients. 
  The six signal stations will be equipped with aluminium 
dioxide display boards which will have an area of 160-180 sq m 
each, according to the company's plan. 
  The company also plans to put 99 bottles of drinks of the 
six 
enterprises into vessels carrying small signal transmitters, and 
sink them where the river runs relatively slowly. 
  The aim is for them to be salvaged after 100 years, a 
company 
official said.
