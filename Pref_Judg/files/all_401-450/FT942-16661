Arguments that bourses have a life independent of Wall Street grew in
strength yesterday, writes Our Markets Staff.
ZURICH was higher for the third straight day, as financials continued to
enjoy their new-found favour, and the SMI index added 30.7 to 2,860.9.
Mr Hans Kaufmann at Bank Julius Baer in Zurich, highlighted comments earlier
this week by Mr Markus Lusser, the Swiss National Bank president, that
long-term Swiss rates should go back down to January's 4 per cent levels,
and that the weak D-Mark, damaging to some Swiss exporters, was a temporary
phenomenon.
Mr Kaufmann added that, while foreign demand was still limited, he believed
that much of the recent switching of portfolios out of the Swiss market was
now complete and that overseas investors were coming to the conclusion that
the outlook was better than they had earlier thought.
Among the financials, UBS rose SFr43, or 3.6 per cent, to SFr1,238.
Winterthur finished SFr5 ahead at SFr705, after a high of SFr720, in
response to its forecast of significantly higher 1993 net profit.
Sulzer registered shares rose SFr45 or 4.4 per cent to SFr1,060 after
better-than-expected results. Swissair, omitting a dividend for 1993, was
marked SFr20 lower to SFr750.
Hero, whose results disappointed the market earlier in the week, fell SFr25
to SFr650 after a German importer withdrew baby food made by a Spanish
subsidiary.
MILAN's rally continued apace as foreign and domestic funds remained buyers,
and the Comit index rose 13.86, or 1.9 per cent, to a 45-month high of
746.38.
SG Warburg noted that, if margins were normalised, the market p/e ratio
would be only 10 times, and commented that the currency also looked
undervalued. It added that the bond market, by trading at almost 3 per cent
above Bund yields, was pricing in a lot of bad political news; that
irreversible reforms had taken place which meant that the 'bad old world'
would not return, whatever the political outcome; and that political worries
were almost always exaggerated.
Fiat rose L250 or 4.3 per cent to L6,037, on renewed rumours that it planned
asset sales, with Toro the favoured candidate. The insurance subsidiary rose
L1,116 or 3.4 per cent to L33,865.
Pirelli rose L77, or 2.7 per cent, to L2,939 amid hopes for a link with
Stet, which is to be privatised later in the year.
Benetton slid L440 to L27,916 on news it was calling an extraordinary
shareholders meeting to obtain approval to place 19m ordinary new shares on
foreign markets.
FRANKFURT broke through 2,200 on the Dax index, peaked at 2,218.17 in the
post-bourse and receded after Wall Street came in lower. The Ibis-indicated
ended at 2,204.46 after rising 10.21 to 2,201.41 on the session, and
turnover rose from DM9.1bn to DM10.3bn.
Allianz, the insurer, extended its relative recovery with a rise of DM38 to
DM2,703. Carmakers were subdued after Daimler's dividend cut and rights
issue news, which left the shares down DM4 to DM868.50 on the session, and
receding later to DM862.
Retailers saw cartel office permission for a Kaufhof/Horten merger, and the
shares rose DM9 to DM239 and DM10 to DM510 respectively - in defiance of the
old adage that, in a takeover bid, only one set of shareholders can win.
PARIS saw the CAC 40 index at a session high of 2,146, before slipping
during the afternoon to close off 8.65 at 2,119.57.
There was news of two further rights issues, one from Cerus, the holding
company, which came during trading and the other from Cap Gemini Sogeti, the
computer services group, after the close.
Cerus, the holding company, fell FFr7.80 to FFr129.00 on a FFr858m rights
issue at FFr100 a share to cut its debt, estimated at FFr852m at the end of
1993. Cap Gemini, up FFr6.20 at FFr196.20, said after hours that it planned
to raise FFr424m through a rights issue at FFr140 a share.
Credit Foncier de France, the banking group, climbed FFr37 to FFr1,211 after
a better than expected 25 per cent increase in 1993 net profit. On the
downside, CarnaudMetalbox lost FFr8.80 to FFr180.50 with its 1993 profits 14
per cent lower.
Oil stocks remained buoyant, Elf Aquitaine gaining another FFr3.10 to
FFr397.50 and Total FFr6.00 to FFr322.50.
MADRID lost early gains after New York opened, and the general index closed
just 0.35 higher at 322.51 in turnover of Pta30bn. Subjects of recent, and
not-so-recent equity placings were active. FCC, the construction stock,
threatened its 1994 low with a fall of Pta200 to Pta15,320 and Acerinox, the
metals company, registered a new high of Pta13,980, up Pta630 on a large buy
order, and on positive forecasts for the company.
AMSTERDAM showed little enthusiasm, with the AEX index closing the session
up just 0.18 at 412.99.
Among the actives Grolsch, the brewer, picked up Fl 1.50 to Fl 51.00 in
spite of firmly denying takeover rumours.
ATHENS fell 1.1 per cent on government plans for a 15 per cent tax on
dividends from mutual and investment funds, the general index closing 11.24
lower at 989.53.
