An American geologist, his wife and father-in-law were shot dead in an ambush 
in the central Philippines, the military said.

The American was identified as John R. Mitchell, 42, of Fairbanks, Alaska. 
Communist rebels who have vowed to kill Americans and attack U.S. interests in 
the Philippines were thought to be responsible. The three were riding in a 
private jeep that looked like a military vehicle when they were attacked near 
Balilihan, a town in Bohol province about 400 miles south of Manila.
