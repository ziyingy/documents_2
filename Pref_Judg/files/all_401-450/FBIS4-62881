<F P=106> ["BS-PRESS" report under rubric "According to Reports From </F>
Correspondents and Information Agencies": "A New Stage of 
Privatization Is Beginning"] 
  [Text] Until now, 50 of the 300 commercial facilities in 
Tbilisi have been privatized and of these, half have been partly 
privatized. The privatization of enterprises is proceeding 
slowly, said Tbilisi Mayor Niko Lekishvili in an interview to a 
BS-PRESS correspondent. The situation is better regarding the 
privatization of living accommodations, 50 percent of which have 
been privatized; the process of legalization is continuing. 
  A new stage of privatization is beginning in the Georgian 
capital, so-called "large privatization" that affects a number 
of large enterprises and commercial facilities, stated Niko 
Lekishvili. The corresponding decree of the head of state has 
been prepared and the process will begin very shortly. The 
question of purchasing facilities that are to be privatized in 
freely convertible currency so as to prevent the budget from 
incurring damage due to inflation is being discussed in the 
corresponding departments. 
  The mayor of Tbilisi stated that one of the obstacles to 
privatization was the position occupied by a number of 
ministries and departments that were not interested in 
developing privatization and were hindering it.
