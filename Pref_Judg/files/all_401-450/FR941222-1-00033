Thus, wastewaters from the production of triarylmethane dyes and pigments were divided into two categories for purposes
of making a listing determination: (1) Wastewaters from the production of triarylmethane dyes and pigments, excluding
triarylmethane pigments using aniline as a feedstock, and (2) wastewaters from the production of triarylmethane
pigments using aniline as a feedstock.

The wastewater categories include mother liquors generated from product filtration, filter washwaters, equipment
and floor cleaning washwaters, break waters, spent scrubber waters, and other process waters. Treated wastewater
effluent also is captured by these wastewater groupings. Although EPA did not sample wastewater following treatment,
treated wastewater would be expected to contain the same or fewer hazardous constituents and the same or lower concentrations
of such constituents than untreated wastewater. Thus, if not listed before treatment, such wastewater is presumed
not to meet the Agency's criteria for listing after treatment. Furthermore, any wastewater listed as hazardous before
treatment would continue to be regulated as hazardous waste after treatment.

Wastewater treatment sludges were grouped in a similar manner to wastewaters. Wastewater treatment sludges generated
from the dye and pigment industries include any sludges generated during the pretreatment or treatment of dye and
pigment wastewaters. This includes pretreatment sludge generated from filtration and precipitation in equalization
and neutralization basins, sludges from powdered activated carbon or other adsorbent treatments, and primary and
secondary biological treatment sludges. Sludge groupings defined for purposes of listing determinations include
wastewater treatment sludge from the production of azo pigments (proposed as K162), wastewater treatment sludge
from the production of azo dyes, excluding FD&amp;C colorants (proposed as K164), wastewater treatment sludge from
the production of anthraquinone dyes and pigments, wastewater treatment sludge from the production of triarylmethane
dyes and pigments, excluding triarylmethane pigments using aniline as a feedstock, and wastewater treatment sludge
from the production of triarylmethane pigments using aniline as a feedstock. These groupings are justified because,
as was true within the wastewater grouping, the sludges covered by each sludge waste group exhibit similarities in
constituent concentrations.

Distillation bottoms from dye and pigment manufacturing are generated during raw material and solvent recovery
operations. The Agency determined that still bottoms from dye and pigment manufacturing are generated only during
recovery operations associated with the manufacture of triarylmethane dyes and pigments. Therefore, the following
waste grouping was developed to address distillation bottoms from the dye and pigment industries: Still bottoms
or heavy ends from the production of triarylmethane dyes or pigments (proposed as K166).

The Agency grouped spent filter aids, diatomaceous earth, or adsorbents used in the production of azo, anthraquinone,
or triarylmethane dyes, pigments, or FD&amp;C colorants into one waste grouping because these wastes all adsorb
unreacted raw materials, by-products, and impurities and are generated in physically similar forms. Because the
constituent composition of these filter aids varies depending on raw materials used, the Agency does not, at this
time, have sufficient data to fully characterize this waste grouping. To further support a listing determination
on these wastestreams, the Agency intends to collect additional information which will allow assessment of these
wastes either as a single waste grouping or, alternatively, as several separate groupings.

Dusts and dust collector fines are generated primarily during drying, grinding, and blending operations used in
manufacturing both dyes and pigments. These wastestreams were grouped because they all are comprised primarily
of product dust.

Product standardization filter cake probably is generated during a final purification step following product standardization.
Information obtained during the industry study does not confirm the existence or description of this wastestream.
However, filter cakes generated during product purification are comprised of spent filter aids, diatomaceous earth,
or other adsorbent, along with product impurities and, therefore, will be characterized with the spent filter aids
wastestream described above.

Therefore, the Agency is including the spent catalyst wastestreams with the spent filter aids, diatomaceous earth,
or adsorbents used in the manufacture of azo, anthraquinone, or triarylmethane dyes, pigments, or FD&amp;C colorants
waste group. The Agency did not encounter any traditional catalysts (
