The priest who founded Covenant House, the nation's largest organization for 
runaway youths, resigned Tuesday after months of disputing allegations of 
sexual misconduct. 
</P>
<P>
"The controversy that has surrounded me for the past three months has made it 
impossible for me to lead Covenant House effectively," Father Bruce Ritter said 
in a statement. 
</P>
<P>
Frank Macchiarola, a former city schools chancellor who served as acting 
president while the allegations were investigated, also resigned. 
</P>
<P>
Macchiarola, who was named acting president on Feb. 7, said he was quitting 
because the shelter's board of directors had voted against his proposals for 
the future of Covenant House. 
</P>
<P>
A spokeswoman for Macchiarola said he was not available for interviews but said 
Macchiarola had wanted to conduct reviews, investigations and audits of current 
practices and make changes. 
</P>
<P>
James J. Harnett, executive vice president and chief operating officer, will 
take over the shelter until a permanent successor to Ritter is found, the 
organization announced. 
</P>
<P>
In an interview, Harnett said he expected an international search for a 
successor to the Franciscan priest to take months and be limited to Roman 
Catholic nuns, brothers and priests.
