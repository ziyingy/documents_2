Time is running out for two long-standing features of British domestic life,
the traditional gas meter and the meter reader.
British Gas aims eventually to replace both with a brick-size electronic
'smart meter'.
In Edmonton, north London, 1,000 homes have been fitted with a Pounds 10
device which reads the existing gas meter automatically four times a day and
transmits the reading to local collection points.
Bigger changes should come from a joint venture British Gas has formed with
Gill Electronic, a Hampshire company, to mass produce a new generation of
meters which measure consumption electronically and transmit readings to a
central computer.
The spread of smart meters will help pave the way for a fully competitive
domestic gas market in 1998, the deadline set by the recent monopoly inquiry
into the gas market.
Consumers will then be able to choose their gas supplier; even selecting
different ones for different times of day.
