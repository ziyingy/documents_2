  [Text] Deputy Prime Minister Amnuai Wirawan yesterday 
called for the establishment of more ozone observation stations 
in developing countries. 
  Mr. Amnuai, addressing the opening of the Third Meeting of 
the Conference of the Parties to the Vienna Convention for the 
Protection of the Ozone Layer at the United Nations Conference 
Centre, said most of the objectives set out when the convention 
was first agreed upon had been achieved. 
  ``New threats to the ozone layer are possible,'' he said, 
pointing to a pressing need for continuing research on ozone 
layer depletion. 
  He drew attention to the work of the World Meteorological 
Organisation in investigating UV-B radiation and its 
environmental effects. 
  UV-B radiation, which has some positive influences on the 
body, can also cause sunburn, snow blindness, cataracts, ageing 
of the skin and skin cancer. It can suppress immunity against 
tumours initiated in the skin, and can affect plant growth and 
plankton formation adversely.
