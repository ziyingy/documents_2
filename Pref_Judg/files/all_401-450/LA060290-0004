Photo, Ricardo Cole, left, thinks his uncle and mother probably would have died 
in the home fire if his brother Manuel, right, hadn't saved them. BOB GRIESER / 
Los Angeles Times; Photo, YOUNG HERO: When flames broke out in his Chula Vista 
home early Friday morning, 17-year-old Manuel Cole came to the rescue of his 
family. He knocked down two doors to help his mother and uncle escape shortly 
before the fire engulfed the house. Family and neighbors are calling Cole a 
hero, but he shrugs off the praise.
