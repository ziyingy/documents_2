Ionica, the private Cambridge-based telecommunications company pioneering
radio access technology, has raised Pounds 30m this year.
A strategic partnership with Pulsar, the Mexican conglomerate, accounts for
most of the investment, which takes Ionica's equity base to Pounds 45m.
Ionica aims to offer a telecoms service for 'fixed' phones in competition
with BT, using radio links for its local network instead of underground
cable. It is piloting its technology in East Anglia and plans to launch its
service next year.
Pulsar plans to use the technology to offer a similar service in Mexico.
