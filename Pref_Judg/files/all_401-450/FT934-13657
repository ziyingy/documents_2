EFFJOHN, the Helsinki-based passenger shipping group, staged a strong
recovery in the first eight months, as better results from its Baltic Sea
operations offset continued losses in its international cruise activities.
The group broke even after financial items, having posted a FM102m (Dollars
17.8m) loss for the same period in 1992. It still expects to make a loss for
the full year, but says the figure will be lower than last year's FM261m
deficit.
Effjohn's main unit, Silja Line, was able to strengthen its position on its
key Baltic routes with streamlining and a reduced challenge from its main
competitor.
Silja was able to increase passenger numbers by 27 per cent to 3.8m,
although the Finnish and Swedish economies remained weak. Operating profits
were up to FM146m from FM63m.
By contrast, the group's international activities, which include the
cross-Channel company, Sally UK, and cruise shipping operations in the US,
saw operating losses deepen to FM38m from FM25m.
Turnover was up 33 per cent at FM3.24bn.
The FM204m operating profit, which included a FM96m gain from vessel sales,
was wiped out by higher financial costs reflecting the group's extensive
investments in new tonnage.
