Professor Stephen Littlechild, electricity industry regulator, yesterday
received a mandate to continue in office until almost the end of the century
when he was reappointed for a second five-year term of office, Michael Smith
writes.
Yesterday's announcement by the Department of Trade and Industry confirmed
industry expectations, but comes after speculation that Prof Littlechild may
have lost the government's confidence because of controversial stands on
issues including the production of coal and electricity. The reappointment
to August 1999 will enable him to oversee the introduction of a system which
many people believe will be as close to full de-regulation as possible.
Electricity distribution will remain a monopoly but consumers will be able
to choose their supplier of power by 1998. By then there will be much more
competition in power generation.
Prof Littlechild, 50, remains on leave from his job as head of the
department of economics at Birmingham University.
Mr Tim Eggar, energy minister, yesterday said that Prof Littlechild had
played an important role in the creation of a competitive electricity market
and had established Offer as an authoritative regulatory body for the
industry.
