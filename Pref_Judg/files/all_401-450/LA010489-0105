The California Public Utilities Commission warned consumers Tuesday that up to 
25 unauthorized companies may be trying to sell long-distance telephone 
services illegally in the state.

<P>
Marco Valenti, manager of the PUC's consumer affairs branch, said the 
unauthorized companies seem to concentrate on residential customers and small 
businesses.

Usually, he said, the companies offer some form of flat fee for unlimited 
long-distance calling or discounts for signing up friends and relatives. In 
many cases, Valenti said, the firms lease only a few telephone lines from major 
long-distance carriers, and these lines soon become so crowded that customers 
find them constantly busy.

Valenti also cited a case in which a consumer responded to a sales pitch by 
mailing $500 to an office address in Dallas -- only to find later, after 
contacting the PUC, that there was no record of any such company. The money has 
not been recovered.

Valenti urged consumers approached by representatives of long-distance 
companies with which they are unfamiliar to check with the PUC in Los Angeles 
((213) 620-2570) or in San Francisco ((415) 557-1048) to make sure that the 
firms are certified by the state. The state Department of Consumer Affairs also 
offers a booklet, "Choosing a Long-Distance Telephone Company," that can be 
ordered by calling (916) 445-1254.

Hundreds of long-distance telephone companies have started selling service 
since the breakup of the Bell System 5 years ago, Valenti noted. The PUC 
certifies more than 120 firms to provide service in California. These companies 
are required to file their prices with the commission and to submit to state 
regulatory procedures.
