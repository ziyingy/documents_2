Cupid, the USM-quoted bridal wear company, said at its annual meeting that
last week's receivership of Berkertex would provide the company with
exciting potential to expand market share.
The company added that Pronuptia-Youngs was continuing to trade strongly and
the order book for the Quilty nursery/childcare division had grown
significantly in the last few weeks.
