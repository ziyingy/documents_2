Efficient and effective government requires that the use of the finite resources available to administer the programs
be maximized. Therefore, part of the Department's Framework for Action is to maximize resources wherever possible.
One of the important avenues to pursue in this regard is effective use of the USDA commodity program. The Department
recognizes that commodity foods are a significant component of the meals that are served to children and, therefore,
need to be as nutritious as possible. A wide variety of foods ranging from grain products to fruits and vegetables to
meat, poultry and fish are already being offered. The Department plans to continue to offer this wide array of foods.
Improvement is always possible, however, and the Department intends to intensify its review of purchase specifications
to assure that products are as low in fat and sodium as possible while still maintaining palatability for consumers.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In addition, the USDA agencies that are key partners in delivering commodities are working with one another, as well
as with industry, to modify labels on commodities that go to the schools to include nutrition information, and to develop
new products, like low-fat cheeses, that will provide the schools with more flexibility to meet the Dietary Guidelines.
This latter effort will have a salutary effect not only on the commodity program, but could also prove useful in providing
schools with a larger array of healthful products to choose from when they make their local purchases. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Because schools do purchase significant amounts of food independent of the commodity program, the Department is
also considering various other strategies for improving the quality and effectiveness of those purchases. For example,
a pilot test is planned for School Year 1994 with the Department of Defense to procure produce for the school meal programs.
Through this project, schools can obtain a much wider variety of fresh produce than USDA can provide directly. The
Department is also working to facilitate interaction among schools, State Departments' of Agriculture, small resource
farmers and farmers' markets. This has great potential for improving the quality of the foods used by those schools
that are close to particular growing areas as well as providing important new markets for small farmers. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In summary, the Department is committed to improving the quality of school meals and the health of the nation's children
through a variety of approaches. There is complete recognition that success can only be achieved over time and through
the efforts of the Federal government working in concert with State and local administering agencies, industry,
the Congress, a variety of private organizations and the ultimate beneficiaries of the school meals programs_children
and their parents.

The Department's mission continues to be to carry out the declared policy of Congress to ``safeguard the health and
well-being of the Nation's children.'' In order to meet this goal, school meals must change to reflect the scientific
consensus that is articulated in the Dietary Guidelines. Therefore, the Department believes that current nutrition
standards must be expanded to incorporate the Dietary Guidelines in the NSLP and SBP regulations and is proposing
to amend &sect;&sect;210.10 and 220.8 to require that school meals meet the applicable recommendations of the Dietary
Guidelines including the quantified standards established for fat and saturated fat. Proposed regulations would
also require schools to make an effort to reduce sodium and cholesterol, increase dietary fiber and serve a variety
of foods. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
A more comprehensive discussion of implementation occurs later in this preamble, including the time frames that
would be followed for the shift to the updated nutrition standards. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
While the proposed regulations would include the basic provision that school meals meet nutrition standards over
a one week menu cycle, the proposed revision would also require meals to provide a level of nutrients for specified
age groups rather than meet minimum amounts of specific food items for each age group as is currently required. Sections
210.10 and 220.8, therefore, would incorporate nutrition standards for various age/grade groups based on the RDA
for the following nutrients: Protein, vitamin A, vitamin C, iron, and calcium as well as the energy allowances for
calories. Sections 210.10 and 220.8 would also set the maximum levels of calories from fat and saturated fat at 30 percent
and 10 percent of calories, respectively.
