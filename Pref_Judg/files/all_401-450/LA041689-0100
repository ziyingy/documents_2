Like storied thinkers and ascetics through the ages, physics professor Paul 
Boynton sometimes goes to a cave to ponder some of life's biggest questions. 
</P>
<P>
The cave -- really an abandoned mine shaft in the Cascade Range -- is Boynton's 
laboratory for studying a question that has baffled physicists for at least two 
decades: 
</P>
<P>
Is there a fifth physical force, a different kind of gravity, that could better 
explain observable events in the universe? 
</P>
<P>
Current scientific wisdom holds that there are four forces of nature: 
electromagnetism; the "strong force" that holds atomic nuclear material intact; 
the "weak force" responsible for nuclear decay; and gravity, which keeps 
everything on Earth in place and the stars tethered in their galaxies. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Ring Suspended in Cave 
</P>
<P>
In the mouth of the mine shaft, the physicist has suspended a special ring -- 
half copper, half polyethylene -- to test whether a different kind of physical 
force may be detected between the ring and the immense mass of granite in the 
cliff side. 
</P>
<P>
Normal gravitational force that makes one body attract another is certainly 
there. But might there be another force working against gravity? Or, perhaps, 
one that adds to it? 
</P>
<P>
The ring in the cave and dozens of other experiments being conducted by 
scientists around the globe are shots in the dark in the quest for the fifth 
force. 
</P>
<P>
Eminent thinkers freely admit that they are not sure what they are looking for. 
</P>
<P>
Although the existence of a fifth force was posited early this century, the 
modern hunt for it began in earnest when Australian physicist Frank Stacy took 
gravitational measurements in mile-deep mines of central Australia. Stacy 
reported differences in the gravitational pull that were not predicted by 
standard theory. His conclusions, however, and others since were found to be in 
error because they were based on an imperfect model of the Earth's 
gravitational pull. 
</P>
<P>
The hunt goes on. 
</P>
<P>
"We're exploring," says Eric Attleburger, another University of Washington 
physicist using a different means of searching "for whatever it is." 
</P>
<P>
Attleburger, who performs most of his experiments on the University of 
Washington campus, uses tiny disks of copper, beryllium and aluminum suspended 
by metal filaments to determine whether the disks are attracted by a nearby 
mound of lead. 
</P>
<P>
Precise instruments are trained on the disks to measure whether oscillations 
occur that could indicate the presence of a fifth force. 
</P>
<P>
"So far, there is no sign of anything out of the ordinary," Attleburger said. 
But he adds: "Essentially, everybody in physics thinks that there has to be 
more to it." 
</P>
<P>
This quest appears to stem largely from a scientific hunch that something is 
missing in our knowledge about the four known universal forces. 
</P>
<P>
The vague but nagging feeling is that although the four forces do a good job of 
explaining physical events, they lack coherence. They do not, as Attleburger 
says, "make up a pretty package." 
</P>
<P>
The relationships among three of the forces -- the strong, the weak and 
electromagnetism -- are at least partially understood and tied together neatly 
under a unifying theory. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
A Different Approach 
</P>
<P>
"Gravity is still out there all by itself," says Jim Thomas, a physicist doing 
fifth-force experiments at Lawrence Livermore Laboratories in California. 
</P>
<P>
Thomas takes a different tack from Attleburger and Boynton in his experiments. 
He measures gravitational force over a wide area and then measures whether the 
force changes in relation to the distance one climbs up a high tower. 
</P>
<P>
Thomas' experiments are "range dependent." Boynton's and Attleburger's are 
"composition dependent." 
</P>
<P>
The consensus of the three experimenters, as well as thinkers who attended a 
recent conference in the French Alps on "fifth force" work, is that there is no 
clear evidence that another force exists. 
</P>
<P>
Thomas states that he is not even looking for a force apart from gravity, but 
rather a modification of gravity that may depend on distance from an attracting 
object. 
</P>
<P>
Boynton, working at the mouth of the old mining tunnel near Index, Wash., 
observed during experiments two years ago what he believed were small 
differences in the attractive force between the massive granite cliff and 
various materials used in his suspended rings. 
</P>
<P>
But he concluded that the statistical differences recorded were "too close" to 
the degree of possible error in his measuring equipment. 
</P>
<P>
"The differences measured were only three times bigger than the (margin of) 
error," he said. "This time we're trying it with better equipment that is more 
accurate. If there is any force there, attractive or repulsive, it's small." 
</P>
<P>
Several well-known scientists and theoreticians have postulated the existence 
of a yet-undiscovered force -- most dealing with either attraction or repulsion 
between bodies. 
</P>
<P>
"There are a number of reasons for speculating," says Attleburger. "But the 
question is that you've got to look and see. It's really exploring. 
</P>
<P>
"Maybe there is a layer of nature we've been ignorant of for all these years. 
It would terribly exciting if there were." 
</P>
