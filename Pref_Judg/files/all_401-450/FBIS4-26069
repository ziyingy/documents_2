<F P=106> ["Communique on the Tibet Autonomous Region's Environmental </F>
Situation in 1993" -- by the Tibet Autonomous Regional Bureau of 
Urban and Rural Construction and Environmental Protection, June 
1994] 
  [Text] According to Article 11 of the "Environmental 
Protection Law of the PRC," the Tibet Autonomous Region's 
environmental situation in 1993 is announced as follows: 
I. Environmental Conditions 
(1) The Environmental Pollution Situation 
  1. The Atmosphere 
  A total of 1.47 billion standard cubic meters of waste gases 
were discharged in Tibet in 1993, 40 percent more than the 
previous year. In the discharged waste gases, smog was 98 
tonnes, 63.3 percent more than the year before; sulfur dioxide 
was 1,900 tonnes, up 35.7 percent from the year before; and 
industrial dust was 14,657.7 tonnes, an increase of 8.6 percent 
over the previous year. 
  The daily average measurement over 1993 of suspended 
particles in the atmosphere in Lhasa was 194 micrograms per 
cubic meter; the daily average measurement of sulfur dioxide was 
615 micrograms per cubic meter; the daily average of nitrogen 
oxide was 11 micrograms per cubic meter, which was better than 
the previous year and was up to the state's first-level standard 
of atmospheric quality. No acid rains occurred in Tibet in 1993. 
  2. Water 
  A total of 40.775 million tonnes of waste water was 
discharged in Tibet in 1993, up 133 percent from the previous 
year. Of this, industrial waste water was 25.775 million 
tonnes, up 1,332 percent from the year before. Among the 
industrial waste water, chemical (?oxygen absorbent) [xu yang 
liang, 7194 8638 6852] was 25.173 tonnes, heavy metals (mercury 
and lead) were 0.17 tonnes, arsenic was 45.6 tonnes, and 
sulphide was 16.32 tonnes. (Note: The reason why industrial 
waste water increased sharply was that the waste water 
discharged by the Yangbajing experimental geothermal power plant 
was included in this figure; over the last few years, only a 
part of the plant's waste water was taken into account due to 
technical reasons.) 
  The quality of water in Tibet's major rivers and lakes 
reached the state's standards for surface water quality. 
  3. Noise in Urban Areas 
  In 1993, the average equivalent sound level of environmental 
noises in Lhasa city's residential, cultural and educational, 
commercial, and industrial areas as well as mixed area category 
two was all above 60 decibels, exceeding the state environmental 
noise standard for urban areas. Noise levels at eight -- or 
30.8 percent -- of the 26 monitoring points on the city's trunk 
roads exceeded the standard. Compared to the previous year, the 
sources of urban noise and their proportions remained unchanged, 
with traffic noises still topping the list. (Note: mixed area 
category two refers to areas consisting of industrial, 
commercial, and residential sectors with small traffic volume) 
  4. Industrial Solid Wastes and Others 
  In 1993, Tibet's industrial solid wastes amounted to 2,950 
tonnes, up 17 percent over that of the previous year; and the 
amount discharged was 260 tonnes, up 30 percent. The discharge 
occupied 0.2 hectares of land, but no farmland was used. 
  According to relevant investigation, occupational diseases 
such as pneumoconiosis and toxicosis diagnosed in workers of the 
region's industrial and mining enterprises were both lower than 
the national level. In 1993, there was no accident that caused 
environmental pollution in the region. 
(2) The Ecological Environment Situation 
  1. Forests and Grasslands 
  According to the outcome of the fourth national inspection 
on 
forest resources, Tibet was covered with 7.17 million hectares 
of forests, fourth among the nation's provinces, municipalities, 
and autonomous regions. The rate of forest coverage was 9.84 
percent, and the region's 2.084 billion cubic meters of timber 
reserves topped the nation. In 1993, the volume of 200,000 
cubic meters of cut timber was lower than that of the region's 
total forest growth. 
  Tibet's grasslands continued to degenerate with decreasing 
grass growth and coverage area. There were serious problems of 
grass diseases and weed growth, as well as rat and insect pests 
in grassland regions. 
  In 1993, the area of public green grounds in urban areas 
remained relatively unchanged compared to the previous year. 
The per capita area of public green grounds dropped by 4 square 
meters. 
  2. Land 
  The farmland area in Tibet was 223,800 hectares, and the per 
capita farmland area was 1.51 mu. In 1993, 28.24 hectares of 
farmland were permanently requisitioned for construction. 
  3. Climatic Changes and Natural Disasters 
  In 1993, Tibet's climate was basically perennial. The annual 
rainfall was lower than that for the previous years and its 
distribution was uneven. The number of days of gales was 
basically normal, with frequency higher in Lhaze, Baingoin, 
Ngari, and the northern part of Qamdo, but lower in other areas. 
  Droughts were severe during early summer in 1993. Uneven 
rainfall distribution and continuous rainstorms resulted in 
floods. Heavy rains triggered landslides and disrupted traffic, 
causing heavy losses. Snowstorms in winter caused the deaths of 
livestock. 
  In 1993, the rate of forest fires was 2.6 percent. 
II. Environmental Protection 
  In 1993, China marked the 20th anniversary of commencement 
of 
environmental protection as well as the 10th anniversary of 
incorporation of environmental protection into its basic 
national policy. The Tibet regional party committee and 
people's government attached further importance to and 
strengthened the tasks for environmental protection by adopting 
the "Decision on Strengthening Environmental Protection." 
People's congresses and people's political consultative 
conferences at all levels strengthened their guidance and 
supervision in the work. Further, governments and departments 
at all levels earnestly implemented their duties in 
environmental protection with new progress. 
  1. Prevention of Environmental Pollution 
  In 1993, Tibet further upgraded the tasks of preventing 
environmental pollution. The rate of removed smoke and dust in 
burnt gaseous wastes was 85 percent, up five percent from the 
previous year. The rate of treated industrial sewage was 44.8 
percent, up 25.9 percent over the previous year. Comprehensive 
use of industrial solid wastes totalled 1,500 tonnes. 
  Public facilities in urban areas were further improved. 
Lhasa city built 4.46 km of new underground sewers, increasing 
the total length of the city's underground sewers to 80 km. 
  Tibet directly invested 20.82 million yuan to prevent 
industrial pollution, an increase of 13.82 million yuan over 
that of the previous year. Of this, 12 million yuan was 
invested in three environmental protection construction projects 
and 8.57 million yuan was invested in industrial sewage 
treatment. 
  2. Protection of Ecological Environment 
  In 1993, Tibet's afforestation covered a total area of 2,680 
hectares [ha], up 5.14 percent from the previous year. The 
Tibetan people voluntarily planted 4.29 million trees, or 
741,000 trees more than the previous year; and the region 
cultivated 638,000 economic trees, an increase of 546,500. 
Grass was planted on 8,000 ha of land and fencing was erected 
for some 324,668 ha of grasslands. Elimination of rats, insect 
pests, and grass diseases was carried out on 15.91 ha [as 
published], and 27,900 ha of grasslands were irrigated. 
  According to incomplete statistics, in 1993, Tibet completed 
10 water conservancy projects; improved the irrigation for 3,527 
ha of farmland; added 960 ha of irrigated farmland; and carried 
out preservation work for an additional 1,073 ha of irrigated 
farmland. The completion of seven drinking water projects helped 
to solve the water supply problem for 1,890 people and 7,890 
livestock. 
  In 1993, Tibet put into operations seven hydroelectric power 
stations with a generating capacity of 9,220 kilowatts, and 
added small hydroelectric power generators with a capacity of 
3,225 kilowatts in rural areas. An additional 32 villages and 
4,868 people were provided with power supply. The "Tibet 
Yangguang [sun] Plan" entered its second phase. Last year, the 
region promoted the use of 3,500 units of solar stoves, 180 
square meters of solar water heaters, and small solar power 
sources with a capacity of 4.8 kilowatts. Energy conserved from 
the use of solar stoves and water heaters was equivalent to some 
3,000 tonnes of standard coal. The development of hydroelectric 
power and the promotion of solar energy use enhanced ecological 
environmental protection in the region. 
  The comprehensive development work in the middle reaches of 
the Yarlung Zangbo River, Lhasa River, and Nyang Qu River 
proceeded well. As of 1993, 18 forestry projects, 25 water 
conservancy projects, and 4 energy projects -- with a total 
investment of nearly 175 million yuan -- had been launched in 
the region. By building water conservancy projects, revamping 
medium and low yield farmlands, improving grasslands, and 
planting trees, the comprehensive development in the region has 
yielded noticeable economic results, social benefits, and 
environmental results. 
  We made relatively good progress in building nature 
conservation areas in 1993. The Mount Qomolangma [Everest] 
Nature Conservation Area was listed as a state-level nature 
conservation area. In addition, the regional government 
approved and established six regional-level nature conservation 
areas, adding 289,900 square km to Tibet's nature conservation 
areas. At the end of 1993, Tibet had 13 state and regional 
level nature conservation areas, with a total area of 325,400 
square km, accounting for 26.5 percent of Tibet's total area. 
  3. Strengthening Environmental Management 
  A nationwide inspection of enforcement of the environmental 
protection law was conducted in 1993. The Tibet Regional 
People's Congress Standing Committee and Government attached 
great importance to the inspection -- we set up a regional 
leading group to coordinate inspection work, worked out an 
inspection plan, and laid down a plan for carrying out 
inspection work. Environmental and resources management 
departments and law enforcement departments at all levels did 
their jobs strictly according to the law, and good results were 
achieved. Over the last few years, assessment of environmental 
effects has been conducted for all construction projects that 
might affect the environment. Construction of pollution 
prevention facilities has been carried out on 80 percent of 
regional level construction projects. The amounts of pollution 
discharge fees levied by the government in 1993 increased 
considerably over the previous year, and the fees were levied on 
more projects than before. In 1993, forestry public security 
departments uncovered 56 cases involving damaging resources and 
the environment; cracked four rings engaged in these activities; 
punished 111 persons; confiscated 650 guns, 98 wildlife 
products, 35,000 steel loops, 447 iron clips, and 22,600 yuan in 
stolen money and goods. 
  All localities in Tibet continued to conduct environmental 
protection propaganda activities in 1993 -- they featured 
television serial reports on environmental protection and held 
region-wide quizzes on environmental protection. Leaders of 
Tibet delivered speeches on television on "World Environment 
Day." 
  Tibet had 79 environmental protection workers at the end of 
1993. An environment monitoring station was built in Xigaze 
Prefecture and is ready for operation. Shannan Prefecture and 
Lhasa have approved establishment of environment monitoring 
stations. 
  In 1993, the "Study of the Background of Tibet's Soil and 
Environment" project won the region's second-grade prize for 
scientific work. 
  The Tibet Autonomous Regional environment monitoring station 
was named an advanced environmental protection collective of the 
country. 
  Environmental protection benefits the contemporary 
generation 
and the generations to come. Currently, Tibet is still one of 
the country's economically backward areas; therefore, economic 
development and environmental protection are equally arduous 
tasks for the region. We need to continue to work hard to 
maintain and gradually improve Tibet's environmental conditions 
and to ensure that the region's economy develops in a sustained, 
rapid, and healthy manner.
