  [Text] From FY94, the Ministry of Transport (MOT) will 
begin developing technologies to convert diesel trucks, which 
belch black smoke and nitrogen oxides (NO[.sup]x[/]) as they 
run, into clean natural gas (CNG) trucks. This is a unique 
effort seen nowhere else in the world, and since natural gas is 
an abundant resource, achieving practical use of natural gas 
trucks will help conserve the environment and stimulate the use 
of alternative energies. 
  NO[.sup]x[/] and black smoke emitted by diesel trucks are 
causes of air pollution in large cities. To suppress the 
emission of such pollutants, MOT is trying to convert 
medium-size diesel trucks to use clean, abundant natural gas for 
fuel. That is, diesel trucks running on the roads now will be 
transformed into natural gas trucks that will be kind to the 
environment. 
  Compared to gasoline, natural gas emits less NO[.sup]x[/] 
and black smoke. The reason practical use of natural gas trucks 
has been slow is that natural gas is difficult to ignite; it is 
stable and difficult to burn. A characteristic of the diesel 
engine is that fuel is compressed, which causes self-ignition. 
Self-ignition of natural gas is difficult, however. Thus the 
idea of initially burning gasoline to assist ignition is being 
considered. Fuel compression ratio is expected to be about 16. 
Eventually, this will be replaced by an engine in which ignition 
of natural gas by itself will be possible. 
  Additionally, because natural gas vehicles emit a 
substantial 
amount of methane, an unburned substance that causes global 
warming, a catalyst that will eliminate methane must be 
attached. MOT's research organization, the Traffic Safety and 
Pollution Research Institute, will develop an oxide catalyst or 
catalytic converter rhodium (CCRO) with strong methane clean-up 
capability and will establish operating standards. 
  With the establishment of these technologies, diesel trucks 
will be reborn as natural gas trucks that will be kind to the 
environment and that will promote the use of alternative 
energies. 
  MOT plans to use funds from the Environment Agency's budget 
to complete a series of research by FY97.
