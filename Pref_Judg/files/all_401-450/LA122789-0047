If American consumers don't want to find themselves coming up way short in the 
upcoming decade, they'd better start getting smart now for the 1990s, experts 
warn. So just what sort of resolutions ought savvy consumers make for the New 
Year and the decade beyond? 
</P>
<P>
Attention, shoppers, here's some select advice. 
</P>
<P>
Your No. 1 priority for the '90s, financial advisers and consumer advocates 
say, should be to pay off those high-interest credit cards. There's an 
especially pressing reason to do so, besides, of course, the simple, ugly truth 
that too many Americans charge too much on their plastic. 
</P>
<P>
Consider that as the old decade passes away, so, too, will whatever tax 
advantage you might have held in writing off the interest costs on credit 
cards, many of them charging rates of 18%-20%. On your 1989 taxes, you can 
deduct only 20% of those stiff fees; in 1990, only 10%; after that, it goes to 
0%. 
</P>
<P>
Still, "60% of the people still don't pay off their credit cards within the 
grace period and they end up paying all that high-interest," said Andrew 
Tobias, author of a number of best sellers, including "The Only Investment 
Guide You'll Ever Need," and "Managing Your Money." Tobias, in a phone 
interview from Miami, urged smart consumers to "pay off all of their 
high-interest credit cards, making 20% tax-free, risk-free money." 
</P>
<P>
"It's also good for the country," he said, "because people are borrowing too 
much and not saving enough. We're selling Hawaii for a lot of VCRs. We've sold 
a good chunk of downtown Los Angeles, too. Of course, we have every right to do 
that, but I'm not sure it's the right thing to do. It's like the Indians when 
they sold Manhattan. . . ." 
</P>
<P>
Tobias, who added that "it's very hard to get rich borrowing on credit cards," 
continues to recommend his novel plan of buying essentials in bulk to save 
money. 
</P>
<P>
"The savings can be very dramatic," he said, explaining that instead of buying 
one medium tube of toothpaste for $1.89, consumers should wait for the economy 
size to go on sale and buy six "at a great price. That's a year's supply but 
it's 40% less per ounce. And that's a 40% tax-free return on your money." 
</P>
<P>
Steve Brobeck, of the Washington-based Consumer Federation of America, endorsed 
Tobias' credit-card advice and recommended that consumers "before they make 
major purchases, . . . should read Consumer Reports. Not just the Buying Guide, 
but the monthly magazine. It's good not only for products (ratings), but it has 
good general information such as articles on cholesterol levels. 
</P>
<P>
"And anyone who doesn't consult it before buying a new car is looking a gift 
horse in the mouth," he said, adding that families who can't afford the 
magazine or buyer's guide can find them in most local libraries. 
</P>
<P>
Brobeck also urged consumers not only to comparison shop but to "seek to 
negotiate a better deal. Nothing is fixed any more. Everything is open to 
negotiation. You can haggle over virtually everything, even mortgage loans. On 
high-ticket items, merchants are increasingly willing to haggle over the 
price." 
</P>
<P>
But the relationship between retailers and customers need not be adversarial, 
said Bill Dombrowski, vice president of corporate affairs for Carter Hawley 
Hale, parent company of the Broadway department stores. Consumers, he said, 
"should take advantage of the improved level of service. We're placing more 
emphasis on service than ever before and people should take advantage of the 
help salespersons can give them." 
</P>
<P>
When buying, especially big-ticket items like appliances, smart shoppers know 
it pays to look beyond just the price tag. Consumers, for the sake of their 
future utility bills, as well as of the environment, should try to pick 
products that save the most energy, experts said. 
</P>
<P>
Then, once those products get in their homes, "there are a number of ways 
consumers can be more efficient," said Denise King of Southern California Gas 
Co. "The No. 1 thing is to keep natural gas appliances clean, properly adjusted 
and in good working order. They can control their usage with conservation 
measures. And if they're remodeling or need to replace appliances, they should 
consider higher efficiency" units. 
</P>
<P>
If you have to replace a gas water heater, she said, consider models with an 
85% rather than the standard 76% efficiency rating. They may cost $100 more up 
front, but you'll save $15-$30 each year on gas bills. 
</P>
<P>
Consumers also can conserve energy and cut their bills by taking advantage of 
new technologies in "lighting, appliances and building materials," said Michael 
Shames, executive director of Utility Consumers' Action Network (UCAN) in San 
Diego. "There are numbers of new things -- improved insulation, film for 
windows that reduces the amount of heat buildup in the house, better caulking 
materials." 
</P>
<P>
If you're looking to preserve your own energies, it also might be wise, the 
experts said, to consider consulting some common consumer experts. Like? Well, 
consider travel agents, said Eric Friedheim, editor in chief of Travel Agent 
magazine in New York. 
</P>
<P>
"That's where they're going to get the best advice about discounts, lower air 
fares, trendy destinations and hotel accommodations," he said. "The 
reservations systems are computerized and (agents) can find a lot more options 
than a person on his own." 
</P>
<P>
Consumers in the 1990s will have to be "much more sophisticated" about all 
kinds of computerized and otherwise high-tech products and services, said Ken 
McEldowney, executive director of the nonprofit Consumer Action group in San 
Francisco. "Purchasing is going to be done by various types of computer 
technology. And that's going to have incredible implications in terms of 
consumers being able to make intelligent decisions. . . ." 
</P>
<P>
McEldowney and Shames both see potential problems in the development of 
sophisticated, consumer computer data bases and computerized, credit-card 
purchases of almost all goods, including groceries. 
</P>
<P>
McEldowney said he fears that "the technology is going to drive a wedge between 
those who are computer sophisticated and those who aren't." He also has 
concerns about fraud increasing with the computer systems. 
</P>
<P>
Shames, meantime, worries about consumers' "privacy rights." As computerized 
buying expands, Americans must "demand from merchants that personal buying 
habits not be disclosed without permission," he said, adding that consumers 
must learn to see the trade-offs between high-tech convenience and the reality 
that, "almost everything you purchase with a credit card is on . . . data bases 
and that recorded information may become shared with other companies." 
</P>
<P>
And if Big Brother doesn't snare unsuspecting consumers in the 1990s, watch out 
because other woes just might: Crime will continue to be a major American 
headache, law-enforcement officials say, adding that bunko schemes and fake 
charities, for example, assuredly won't disappear in the next decade. 
</P>
<P>
But Good Samaritans with smarts more than ever will know in the '90s that "it's 
a good idea to check out references before you give to a charity you don't know 
too much about," said Linda Cuarenta, senior investigator for the Los Angeles 
City Social Service Department. 
</P>
<P>
"If a charity is soliciting in Los Angeles and we have the organization on 
file, we can tell people about it," she said. "Or we might not have it on file 
but have heard of it. People can call us ((213) 485-5003) and ask. They should 
also ask the charity for its financial statement and a brochure about it. If 
it's legitimate, they should send it." 
</P>
<P>
Two other sources that check on charities: the National Charities Information 
Bureau in New York (212) 929-6300 or the California Attorney General's office 
-- in Los Angeles, (213) 736-2044. 
</P>
<P>
And when it's all said and done, what's the best consumers can hope for from 
the '90s? Well, maybe the advent, finally, of a kinder, gentler age? 
</P>
<P>
"People are much more violent than 25 years ago," cautioned advice columnist 
Dear Abby. "We're living in stressful times and we have to find some way to get 
along, with relatives, with friends, with each other. We should try to hurt as 
few feelings as possible. There's no right way or wrong way to do things. But 
there is a diplomatic way to do everything."
