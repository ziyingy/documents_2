  [Text] According to customs statistics, Estonia exported 
in the first three months of the year 3,644.6 mln kroons' worth 
of goods (including 1,385.4 mln kroons in March), while its 
imports amounted to 4,804.2 mln kroons (1,888.4 mln kroons in 
March). 
  First quarter's imports exceeded exports by 1,159.6 mln 
kroons. In other words, Estonia's foreign trade deficit amounts 
roughly to one third of the export volume. 
  Compared to February, export grew in March by 224.9 mln and 
import, by 576.6 mln kroons. Foreign trade shortfall jumped to 
503.7 mln kroons in March, up by 352.3 mln kroons from February. 
  Estonia received from January through March 77.4 mln kroons' 
worth of humanitarian aid, which accounted for 1.6 percent of 
the imports. 
  The country traded in the first quarter with partners in 97 
states and brought in a positive balance with 45 of them.
