<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
The Government of Japan currently is in the process of preparing a five-year plan for deregulation measures in Japan,
which it expects to finalize by the end of March, 1995. The United States Government has provided the Government of
Japan with an initial list of comments and specific suggestions regarding the deregulation plan, and the United States
Government intends to consult with the Government of Japan in various fora regarding the preparation and implementation
of the plan and other deregulation issues. USTR solicits comments from interested parties regarding specific laws,
regulations, or regulatory practices in Japan, the removal or modification of which would improve market access
for United States products or services.

In the course of the past year, the United States has held three rounds of consultations with Japan addressing deregulation
and competition policy issues in a working group established under the Joint Statement on the United States-Japan
Framework for a New Economic Partnership (the ``Framework''). In these consultations, the United States has proposed
specific regulatory changes by the Government of Japan as well as more general changes in regulatory practices, administrative
procedures, and competition policy enforcement. In addition, in other contexts the United States has held other
consultations with Japan addressing deregulation issues in particular sectors or with respect to particular structural
issues.

In March and June, 1994, Japan announced specific, initial deregulatory measures that it would take in the areas of
housing construction; information and telecommunications; import promotion, market access, and distribution;
and finance, securities, and insurance. The Government of Japan currently is in the process of preparing a five-year
plan to follow up on these initial measures.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Government of Japan invited interested foreign governments to submit specific deregulation requests and comments
to be taken into consideration in preparing its five-year plan. On October 27, the European Union submitted a list
of deregulation requests.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In response to the Government of Japan's invitation, the United States Government, under the coordination of the
Office of the United States Trade Representative, prepared and presented to the Government of Japan, on November
15, 1994, an initial list of deregulation requests and comments for consideration in connection with Japan's five-year
deregulation plan. The list was based on information gathered in the preparation of the annual National Trade Estimates
Report (required by section 181(b) of the Trade Act of 1974, as amended (19 U.S.C. 2241)), information brought to the
attention of various agencies of the United States Government by U.S. industry, and information gathered by the United
States Government. The list is available for public inspection and copying in the USTR Reading Room: Room 101, Office
of the United States Trade Representative, 600 17th Street, NW., Washington, DC 20506. An appointment to review the
list may be made by calling Brenda Webb (202) 395&hyph;6186. The USTR Reading Room is open to the public from 10 a.m.
to 12 noon and 1 p.m. to 4 p.m., Monday through Friday.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The United States Government intends to consult with the Government of Japan in various fora regarding the issues
in the list and regarding the preparation and implementation of the five-year plan. The United States Government
intends to submit to Japan, as appropriate, additional requests or comments regarding the action plan and other deregulation
issues.
