The worst cyclone to hit Bangladesh for two decades has killed at least
1,200 people, officials and state-run television said. The death toll could
rise when reports from remote islands are available.
The cyclone, which struck on Monday night with winds stronger than those
that killed 100,000 people in 1970, has affected 7m people.
