Several first-tier testing procedures have been devised to screen for overt sensory 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
deficits. Many rely on orientation or the response of an animal to a stimulus. Such tests are 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
usually included in the FOB used in screening (e.g., tail-pinch or click responses). 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Responses are usually recorded as being either present, absent, or changed in magnitude 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(Moser, 1989; O'Donoghue, 1989). Screening tests for sensory deficits are typically not 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
suitable to characterize chemical-induced changes in acuity or fields of perception. The 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
characterization of sensory deficits usually necessitates psychophysical methods that study the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
relationship between the physical dimensions of a stimulus and the behavioral response it 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
generates (Maurissen, 1988). 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
One second-tier approach to the characterization of sensory function involves the use 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
of reflex-modification techniques (Crofton, 1990). Chemical-induced changes in the stimulus 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
frequency or threshold required to inhibit a reflex are taken as possible changes in sensory 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
function. Prepulse inhibition has been used only recently in neurotoxicology (Fechter and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Young, 1983) and can be used to assess sensory function in humans as well as in 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
experimental animals. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Various behavioral procedures require that a learned response occur only in the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
presence of a specific stimulus (i.e., discriminated or conditioned responding). Chemical-induced changes in
sensory function are determined by altering the physical characteristics of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the stimulus (e.g., magnitude or frequency) and measuring the alteration in response rate or 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
accuracy. In an example of the use of a discriminated conditional response to assess 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
chemical-induced sensory dysfunction, Maurissen et al. (1983) trained monkeys to respond to 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the presence of a vibratory or electric stimulus applied to the fingertip. Repeated dosing 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
with acrylamide produced a persistent decrease in vibration sensitivity; sensitivity to electric 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
stimulation was unimpaired. That pattern of sensory dysfunction corresponded well to 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
known sensory deficits in humans. Discriminated conditional response procedures have been 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
used to assess the ototoxicity produced by toluene (Pryor et al., 1983) and the visual toxicity 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
produced by methylmercury (Merigan, 1979). 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Procedures to characterize chemical-induced sensory dysfunction have been used often 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
in neurotoxicology. As in the case of most procedures designed to characterize nervous 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
system dysfunction, training and motivational factors can be confounding factors. Many tests 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
designed to assess sensory function for laboratory animals can also be applied with some 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
adaptation to humans.

4.3.2.5. Learning and memory.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 -->
Learning and memory disorders are neurotoxic effects of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
particular importance. Impairment of memory is reported fairly often by adult humans as a 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
consequence of toxic exposure. Behavioral deficits in children have been caused by lead 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
exposure (Smith et al., 1989), and it is hypothesized (Calne et al., 1986) that chronic low-level exposure to toxic
agents may have a role in the pathogenesis of senile dementia. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Learning can be defined as an enduring change in the mechanisms of behavior that 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
results from experience with environmental events (Domjan and Burkhard, 1986). Memory 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
is a change that can be either short-lasting or long-lasting (Eckerman and Bushnell, 1992). 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Alterations in learning and memory must be inferred from changes in behavior. However, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
changes in learning and memory must be separated from other changes in behavior that do 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
not involve cognitive or associative processes (e.g., motor function, sensory capabilities, and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
motivational factors), and an apparent toxicant-induced change in learning or memory should 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
be demonstrated over a range of stimuli and conditions. Before it is concluded that a 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
toxicant alters learning and memory, effects should be confirmed in a second learning 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
procedure. It is well known that lesions in the brain can inhibit learning. It is also known 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
that some brain lesions can facilitate some types of learning by removing behavioral 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
tendencies (e.g., inhibitory responses due to stress) that moderate the rate of learning under 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
normal circumstances. A discussion of learning procedures and examples of chemicals that 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
can affect learning and memory have appeared in recent reviews (Heise, 1984; WHO, 1986; 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Peele and Vincent, 1989). 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
One simple index of learning and memory, which can be measured as a first-tier 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
endpoint, is habituation. Habituation is defined as a gradual decrease in the magnitude or 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
frequency of a response after repeated presentations of a stimulus. A toxicant can affect 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
habituation by increasing or decreasing the number of stimulus presentations needed to 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
produce response decrements (Overstreet, 1977). Although habituation is a very simple form 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
of learning, it can also be perturbed by a number of chemical effects not related to learning. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
A more complicated approach to studying the effects of a chemical on learning and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
memory involves the pairing of a novel stimulus with a second stimulus that produces a 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
known, observable, and quantifiable response (i.e., classical ``Pavlovian'' conditioning). The 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
novel stimulus is known as the conditioned stimulus, and the second, eliciting stimulus is the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
unconditioned stimulus. With repeated pairings of the two stimuli, the conditioned stimulus 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
comes to elicit a response similar to the response elicited by the unconditioned stimulus. The 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
procedure has been used in behavioral pharmacology and, to a lesser extent, in 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
neurotoxicology. Neurotoxicants that interfere with learning and memory would alter the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
number of presentations of the pair of stimuli required to produce conditioning or learning. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Memory would be tested by determining how long after the last presentation of the two 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
stimuli the conditioned stimulus would still elicit a response (Yokel, 1983). Other classically 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
conditioned responses known to be affected by psychoactive or neurotoxic agents are 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
conditioned taste aversion (Riley and Tuck, 1985) and conditioned suppression (Chiba and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Ando, 1976). 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Second-tier procedures to assess learning or memory typically involve the pairing of a 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
response with a stimulus that increases the probability of future response through 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
reinforcement. Response rate can be increased by using positive reinforcement or removing 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
negative reinforcement. Learning is usually assessed by determining the number of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
presentations or trials needed to produce a defined frequency of response. Memory can be 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
defined specifically as the maintenance of a stated frequency of response after initial training. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Neurotoxicants may adversely affect learning by increasing or decreasing the number of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
presentations required to achieve the designated criterion. Decrements in memory may be 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
indicated by a decrease in the probability or frequency of a response at some time after initial 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
training. Toxicant-induced changes in learning and memory should be interpreted within the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
context of possible toxicant-induced changes in sensory, motor, and motivational factors. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Examples of instrumental learning procedures used in neurotoxicology are repeated 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
acquisition (Schrot et al., 1984), passive and active avoidance, Y-maze avoidance, spatial 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
mazes (radial-arm maze), and delayed matching to sample (Heise, 1984; WHO, 1986; Tilson 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
and Mitchell, 1984).
