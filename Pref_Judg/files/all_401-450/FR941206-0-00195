(iii) The owner or operator shall prepare and record sufficient information that documents the average VO concentration
for the hazardous waste. Information may be used that is prepared by either the facility owner or operator or by the
generator of the hazardous waste. Examples of information that may be used as the basis for knowledge of the waste include:
organic material balances for the source or process generating the waste; VO concentration measurements for the
same type of waste performed in accordance with the procedure specified in paragraph (a)(5)(iv) of this section;
previous individual organic constituent test data for the waste that are still applicable to the current waste management
practices; documentation that the waste is generated by a process for which no organics-containing materials are
used; previous test data for other locations managing the same type of waste; or other knowledge based on manifests,
shipping papers, or waste certification notices.

(iv) If test data other than VO concentration measurements performed in accordance with the procedure specified
in paragraph (a)(5)(iv) of this section are used as the basis for knowledge of the waste, then the owner or operator
shall document the test method, sampling protocol, and the means by which sampling variability and analytical variability
are accounted for in the determination of the average VO concentration. For example, an owner or operator may use individual
organic constituent concentration test data that are validated in accordance with Method 301 in appendix A of 40 CFR
part 63 as the basis for knowledge of the waste.

(b) Waste determination procedures for treated hazardous waste. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(1) An owner or operator shall perform the applicable waste determination for each treated hazardous waste placed
in a waste management unit exempted under the provisions of &sect;265.1083(c)(2) of this subpart from using air emission
controls in accordance with standards specified in &sect;265.1085 through &sect;265.1088 of this subpart, as applicable
to the waste management unit. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(2) The owner or operator shall perform a waste determination for each discrete quantity of treated hazardous waste
as follows: 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(i) When the hazardous waste is treated by a continuous process, the owner or operator shall: 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(A) Perform an initial waste determination for the treated waste stream before the first time any portion of the material
in the waste stream is placed in a waste management unit subject to this subpart, and thereafter update the information
used for the waste determination at least once every 12 months following the date of the initial waste determination;
and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(B) Perform a new waste determination whenever changes to the hazardous waste streams fed to the process are reasonably
likely to cause the characteristics of the hazardous waste at the point of waste treatment to change to levels that
fail to achieve the applicable conditions specified in &sect;265.1083(c)(2) of this subpart. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(ii) When the hazardous waste is treated by a batch process that is performed repeatedly but not necessarily continuously,
the owner or operator shall: 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(A) Perform an initial waste determination for the treated hazardous waste in one or more representative batches
treated by the process, and thereafter update the information used for the waste determination at least once every
12 months following the date of the initial waste determination; and
