Drummer Michael Baker's appearance leading a trio Tuesday night at Le Cafe in 
Sherman Oaks had more to do with his booking the gig than it did with his 
emergence as a leader. 
</P>
<P>
A sideman on the local jazz scene, Baker, albeit a capable player, maintained 
his sideman role in a setting dominated by pianist Billy Childs and bolstered 
by bassist Reggie Hamilton. While it was Baker who soloed the most and 
announced the tunes, four of the seven tunes served up during the group's 
opening set were from Childs' pen; the remaining three included a rather 
disjointed piece by Herbie Hancock and a pair of vocals from the pop bag.

As a vocalist, Baker is undistinguished and indistinctive. Indeed, his cover of 
Leon Russell's "This Masquerade" was but a duplication of George Benson's 
mega-hit -- the only difference coming during a last verse in which Baker 
forgot the lyrics. Likewise, his rendition of Marvin Gaye's "What's Goin' On" 
was but a copy that left one longing for the original. 
</P>

The set started out with Childs' "Mt. Olympus," a funky piece composed of brief 
snippets of melody. Baker's insistent afterbeats and Hamilton's booming 
electric bass obscured the piano, rendering the piece unmemorable. Decibel 
problems plagued the Hancock piece as well.

After the vocal excursions, the trio got down to some swing business with an 
attractive "Room 101," again from Childs. "Quiet Girl," another of the 
pianist's compositions, was a dark and moody ballad, with Childs lending a 
fugue-like quality to the lovely work. His solos were inspired and both Baker 
and Hamilton maintained a much-needed low profile. 
</P>
<P>
The group's collective profile became much higher during "Twilight Is Upon Us," 
a jazz-rock tune whose dramatic introduction soon gave away to a plodding 
rhythm and thunderous din. 
</P>

Baker, who availed himself of every opportunity to solo, will have to learn 
that leadership requires more than displaying an ability to dominate 
instrumentally. The gig could have belonged to Billy Childs, but he would have 
made more musical changes. A. JAMES LISKA
