Summary 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The National Leadership Corps will create a diverse cadre of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
emerging service leaders to help build the highest quality AmeriCorps programs and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
strengthen the national service infrastructure and identity. In 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the first year, the Corporation will recruit up to 50 members 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
from programs such as Peace Corps, VISTA, the Armed Forces, youth 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
corps, and other full-time service programs. T/TA providers will 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
help design and carry out initial training for the Corps which 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
will last two to five weeks and begin in mid-July or early 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
August, 1994. Providers will also help with ongoing training 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
which will occur at least three times during the year. Leadership Corps 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(LC) members will bring skills and expertise to new AmeriCorps 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
programs in year-long assignments starting September, 1994. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=81 g=1 f=1 -->
Amount and Duration of Funding
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The Corporation expects to issue one or more grants or cooperative agreements totaling 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
approximately $100,000 to accomplish the tasks listed below. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Funding would be for one year, with possibility of renewal 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
subject to performance, continuing need, and availability of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
funds. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=81 g=1 f=1 -->
Description of T/TA Activities Desired
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The Corporation seeks T/TA providers who will work with 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Corporation staff and other T/TA providers to design and deliver 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
training for the Leadership Corps. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Proposals may address one or all of the activities outlined 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
below, or may suggest additional activities. These include: 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
_
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Team building 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
among Leadership Corps members. Since 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
LC members will be placed in separate AmeriCorps programs around 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the country, it is important that members develop strong bonds 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
with each other during training so that they are able to provide 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
support to each other and share resources, ideas, and lessons 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
learned throughout their experience. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
_
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Specialty skills. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
This component of training will 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
give LC members an understanding of how to organize and carry out 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
projects that meet community needs in one or more of the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Corporation's national priority areas. (The national priorities 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
areas are discussed more fully in the ``National Priority Skills 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Development'' section below). This element of training will ensure 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
that members know how to make demonstrable impacts on specific 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
community problems and bring resources to programs that do not 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
already exist. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
_
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Leadership skills. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Training that helps LC members 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
master the main tasks required of front-line supervisors such as 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
group facilitation, organizing and managing service projects, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
team building, handling conflict, community relations, working 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
with diverse peoples and organizations, and others. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
_
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Communication skills. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Training that teaches LC 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
members how to communicate effectively, including public speaking 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
and media training. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Proposals should include a plan to train leaders in any or 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
all of the activities mentioned above over a 2&hyph;5 week period 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
during the initial training in July, 1994, as well as 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
periodically throughout the year. The Corporation intends to 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
involve leaders in curriculum design for ongoing training, so 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
applicant plans should be flexible enough to accommodate their 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
input. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=81 g=1 f=1 -->
Encouraged Approaches
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
While the Corporation will consider any proposal that accomplishes one or more of the activities listed above, it

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
especially encourages the following approaches: 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(a) A proposal by an organization that has experience and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
expertise in one or more of the components listed above and can 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
arrange to have expert resources and information available 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
starting in mid-May to provide assistance to the Corporation in 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
designing and delivering training. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(b) A proposal by a consortium of organizations whose 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
members collectively have the expertise to work with the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Corporation to provide all of the training components listed 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
above. This sort of proposal should clearly describe the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
specific responsibilities of each provider, the amount of funds 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
to be allocated to each, the amount of staff time devoted by 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
each, and the mechanisms for cooperation and coordination among 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
members and the Corporation. If possible, the consortium should 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
have experts available to work with the Corporation starting in 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
mid-May as discussed above. For more information on the leadership pool, please contact Jane Marsh at (202) 606&hyph;5000,
extension 173.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 -->
(B) Maintaining a Strong Organization: Fundraising, Program Management, Evaluation, Fiscal Administration,
and Grievance Procedures 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
_Proposals due May 18, 1994. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
_Preference will be given to organizations which can have the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
majority of services available by August 1994.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=81 g=1 f=1 -->
Summary 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Strong management, well-planned and well-executed fundraising, evaluation, and careful, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
appropriate administration of funds are critical to the success 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
of AmeriCorps programs. The Corporation will fund activities 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
that provide information, training, and technical assistance to 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
State Commissions and AmeriCorps programs to strengthen the ability of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
programs to manage, fundraise, and leverage community resources, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
design and perform program evaluation, administer funds 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
effectively, establish grievance procedures, and perform other 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
critical functions. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=81 g=1 f=1 -->
Amount and Duration of Funding 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The Corporation expects to make up to five grants or cooperative 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
agreements in this area. Together, grants will total 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
approximately $1,000,000. Grants will be for one year, with the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
possibility of renewal based on performance, need, and availability of funds. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=81 g=1 f=1 -->
Description of T/TA Activity Desired
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Specific tasks include but are not limited to providing, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
arranging for, or connecting programs to information, training, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
and technical assistance on the factors involved in establishing and maintaining a strong organization, including:

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(a) 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Fundraising
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
: Building on existing Corporation 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
materials, assist grantees in developing comprehensive 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
fundraising strategies. Proposals may also describe ways in 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
which technical assistance can help organizations put fundraising 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
plans into action. The Corporation has an interest, as 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
manifested through the match requirement, to encourage grantees 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
not to rely solely on Corporation funds, but rather to solicit a 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
broad range of financial and in-kind resources from foundations, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
corporations, individuals, and other governmental agencies. As 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the match increases, grantees will need to raise additional 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
funds, create more partnerships, build larger constituencies, and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
leverage additional resources. Technical assistance should be 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
designed with this mission in mind. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(b) 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Program Management
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
: Help programs build a strong 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
leadership team as well as feedback mechanisms such as 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
participant advisory councils or other vehicles which allow for 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
regular input from participants and/or community members and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
involve them in program design, operation, and evaluation. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(c) 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Evaluation and organizational development
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
: Help 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
programs use evaluation as a tool for program improvement. Aid 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
them in developing a mission statement, goals, and annual 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
objectives, concrete operating plans, and tailored evaluation 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
strategies. As needed, work with Corporation evaluation staff to 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
create materials, develop and conduct trainings, and/or offer 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
technical assistance to State Commissions and AmeriCorps programs 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
related to setting direct and demonstrable objectives and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
performing program monitoring and evaluation functions. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(d) 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Fiscal Management
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
: Building on Corporation materials, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
help establish appropriate and effective fiscal management and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
accounting processes, including compliance with all federal laws 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
and regulations. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(e) 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Grievance Procedures
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
: Help grantees develop grievance 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
procedures that give programs systems in which to resolve 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
disputes with staff members, program participants, community 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
residents, and others. These procedures should comply with the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
requirements for grievance procedures described in the National 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
and Community Service Trust Act of 1993. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In each case, providers are expected to: 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
_Bring to bear existing training and subject 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
expertise. Efforts will focus on arranging or providing 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
assistance, rather than developing new training and resources 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
using Corporation funds; 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
_Comply with federal requirements for administering 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
federal funds. The T/TA provider will work with Corporation staff as needed to develop training on this topic; 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
_Demonstrate a commitment to and experience in 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
evaluation that examines outcomes and uses its findings as tools 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
for redesigning and improving program activities and approaches; and
