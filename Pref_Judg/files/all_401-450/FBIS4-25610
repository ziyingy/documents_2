  [Text] Over the last several days, the Army and civilians 
in Guangdong's Zhanjiang city and Maoming city worked hard to 
provide relief for some 100,000 people who were stranded by 
floods. 
  This year's No. 3 strong tropical storm brought serious 
damage to Zhanjiang city and Maoming city. Some 150,000 people 
[figure as heard] were stranded by the floods, which caused more
