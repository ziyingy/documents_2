  [Text] During the first six months of 1993, Honduran 
exports surged significantly. They generated more than $200 
million in foreign exchange, compared to just $154,925,109.93 
the previous year. 
  According to regional figures provided by the Export 
Processing Center (Centrex), exports to Central America between 
January and June 1992 generated $7,387,428.27, compared to 
$14,948,036.61 up to June of this year. 
  The European market was a favorable option for national 
goods; in the first half of 1992, earnings amounted to 
$59,637,682.46, while those for the period ending in June of 
this year amounted to $81,106,198.83, according to Juan Felix 
Garcia, regional director of the Economy Ministry. 
  He indicated that exports to the United States also showed 
positive growth, climbing from $67,210,171.85 in 1992 to 
$84,599,795.65 during the first six months of this year. 
  According to information provided by the official, exports 
to 
other countries totaled $20,689,827.35 during the first half of 
1992. 
  During the same period of this year, however, they fell to 
$20,048,153.20. This decline was due to changes in the import 
market, he indicated. 
  Garcia stated that the overall trend in exports is upward, 
with greater emphasis on nontraditional goods, including farm 
products. 
  He also pointed out that expectations are growing for 
nontraditional goods because the market is expanding, which 
leads to the conclusion that the development of large, medium, 
and small industries is a certainty. 
  In addition to traditional products such as bananas, coffee, 
and sugar, other exports include ornamental plants, parts of 
wicker furniture, cigars, cacao, wood products, melons, and 
plastic products.
