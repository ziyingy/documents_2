MPs yesterday voted overwhelmingly in favour of the ordination of women
priests in the Church of England, in spite of opposition from three
government ministers.
If the measure is approved by the Lords it could come into force early next
year.
Ministers who opposed the measure were Mr John Gummer, environment
secretary, Mr Anthony Nelson, economic secretary to the Treasury, and Miss
Ann Widdecombe, employment minister.
