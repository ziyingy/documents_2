  [Text] Rangoon, June 13 (AFP) -- The Burmese military 
overran two base camps of the Shan state warlord Khun Sa at the 
weekend, killing at least 32 guerrillas and losing 17 of their 
own men, the New Light of Myanmar newspaper said Monday. 
  News of the assault Saturday in Burma's eastern Shan state 
had been preceded by a campaign in the official press denouncing 
Khun Sa as a drug-runner and a "murderous terrorist." 
  If a person found in possession of just 15 grams of heroin 
deserves the death sentence, then Khun Sa, who deals in hundreds 
of tons of drugs, deserves the death sentence more than 100 
times over, the paper said. 
  The report said the military also had 31 wounded in the 
attack on camps where 600 of Khun Sa's Muang Tai Army (MTA) 
fighters were based. 
  The military seized 47 weapons, 199 mines, 304 hand 
grenades, 
53 mortar rounds, 53 assorted rockets, 7,800 rounds of 
ammunition and other equipment as well as 3.5 pounds (1.6 
kilograms) of marijuana, the daily said. 
  Lieutenant General Tin Oo, the army chief of staff and 
commander of the No.1 bureau of special operations, had visited 
the area from June 9 to 11 to encourage front-line troops, the 
paper said. 
  In the continuing press campaign, an article Monday 
described 
Khun Sa's nationalist pose as "media hype." 
  "He is a mere criminal ... and his group is also a mere drug 
ring or a murderous terrorist group," the article said.
