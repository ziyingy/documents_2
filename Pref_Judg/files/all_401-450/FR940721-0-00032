To briefly summarize the evaluation, while the agency believes that belt-positioning seats will improve safety,
the magnitude of that improvement is not known. Belt-positioning booster seats might be more acceptable to children
than shield-type boosters. This could lead to increased usage rates for child restraint systems. Increased usage
is important because child restraints are highly effective when used properly. Belt-positioning booster seats
raise the child up in the vehicle seat, increasing the chances that the vehicle's shoulder belt would fit properly,
and also that the lap belt will fit properly because it will be positioned lower on the child's hips.

NHTSA also concludes that this rule will result in negligible costs for testing labs and manufacturers of belt-positioning
booster seats. The costs would result from testing and certifying belt-positioning seats. Manufacturers will be
minimally affected by this rulemaking because it simply permits new designs in booster seats and does not require
any design change or impose additional costs on manufacturers. Manufacturers that do not want to manufacture a belt-positioning
booster seat will not be affected.

NHTSA has considered the effects of this rulemaking action under the Regulatory Flexibility Act. I hereby certify
that it will not have a significant economic impact on a substantial number of small entities. The agency knows of 14
manufacturers of child restraints, seven of which NHTSA considers to be small businesses (including Kolcraft, which
with an estimated 500 employees, is on the borderline of being a small business).

Regardless of the number of small businesses, this rule will not have a significant economic impact on these entities.
The rule would affect manufacturers only if they choose to manufacture a new type of booster seat. The amendment could
benefit manufacturers by allowing them to manufacture and sell a new product. However, the agency does not know how
interested manufacturers are in belt-positioning child seats, and even if they were interested, the extent to which
consumers would purchase the product.

Small organizations and governmental jurisdictions procure child restraint systems for programs such as loaner
programs. However, only a small percentage of loaner programs carry booster seats. In any event, NHTSA believes that
any small impact on price, either positive or negative, will not have a substantial impact on these loaner programs.
Thus, these entities would not be significantly affected by this rule.

This rulemaking action has been analyzed in accordance with the principles and criteria contained in Executive Order
12612, and the agency has determined that this rule does not have sufficient federalism implications to warrant the
preparation of a Federalism Assessment.
