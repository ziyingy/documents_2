  [Editorial Report] Caracas EL NACIONAL in Spanish on 16 
March publishes on page D-11 a 350-word report on student unrest 
in Lara State, and Caracas EL UNIVERSAL in Spanish on 16 March 
publishes on page 4-29 a 200-word report on student unrest in 
Maturin. The first report notes the incidents involve students 
in Barquisimeto, Lara State, who on 15 March protested the loss 
of discounted preferential student bus fares. They hijacked 
several buses and set one on fire. Unrest began at 0700 with 
students setting tires on fire, but grew increasingly violent by 
1000. Demonstrators stoned several buses and a shopping center. 
Police report that many of the demonstrators were not students, 
but infiltrated agitators. 
  The second report involves students from the Francisco 
Iznardi High School who clashed with the State Police Special 
Brigade on 15 March, also over bus fares. Police used tear gas 
to try and disperse the mob who hurled stones. According to 
witnesses, these were the most violent clashes ever seen in this 
city. Additionally, there was a transportation strike called 
for by the unions, which prevented hundreds of people from 
riding buses to work. The Mayor's Office reportedly has not 
replied to a request for a 15-bolivar fare hike. Students have 
stated that the student half fare must be maintained otherwise 
they will continue the unrest in Maturin.
