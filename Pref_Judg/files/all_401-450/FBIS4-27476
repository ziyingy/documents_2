<F P=106> [Interview with Police General Chawalit Yotmani, secretary </F>
general of the Narcotics Control Board Office, by unidentified 
correspondent; date and place not given] 
  [Excerpt] [Passage omitted] [Correspondent] At the recent 
seminar in the United States on the global narcotics situation, 
what did the Asian countries say about the situation in the 
countries in the Golden Triangle? 
  [Chawalit] Thailand and the United Nations, whose UNDCP 
office is located in Thailand, talked about the problem in Laos 
and Burma. A master plan for tackling the problem in Laos is 
already completed. A plan for Burma is next, because most of 
the illicit opium cultivation is in that country. It will be 
difficult due to the political issue involving the ethnic 
monorities, which have been waging resistance against the 
Burmese Government. Some areas will not be accessible to 
control by the government. We will have to cooperate with the 
United Nations on this issue. 
  [Correspondent] How much heroin is produced annually in the 
Golden Triangle? 
  [Chawalit] It is estimated at 40-60 tons; no more than 60 
tons at most. These figures are derived from estimated 
cultivation and refining capacities. No one knows the real 
production figures. 
  [Correspondent] How much marijuana is produced in Thailand? 
  [Chawalit] It is estimated at 100-200 tons a year. There 
was a lot of cultivation in the northeast. After the 
eradication efforts were launched, however, cultivation has been 
moved to the mountains and jungles in about 20 provinces in 
various parts of the country. The growers themselves do not own 
the land where marijuana is cultivated. In this way, the 
growers hope they can better avoid detection by the police. 
  [Correspondent] The narcotics traffickers have been able to 
transport their products rather effectively. What has your 
office done to deal with this? 
  [Chawalit] It is not possible for us to inspect every 
container. Therefore, we will have to rely on good intelligence 
to inspect suspected containers. Information must come from the 
end destination. For example, we will follow up if there is 
information that a consignment is destined for a certain 
location. Several units are involved in following up such 
information, including my office, the police, the customs 
offices, and foreign units. The practice is to perform some 
inspections, but we must ensure that such inspection does not 
create unnecessary trouble for honest businessmen. [passage
