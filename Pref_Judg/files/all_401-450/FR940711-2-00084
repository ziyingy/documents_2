Site-Specific Preventive Health Education_An activity designed to address health risks in a community where presenting
specific information or recommendations can assist the community in understanding, preventing, or mitigating
the health effects of hazardous substances exposure. Target audiences are community members and health professionals.
Preventive health education related to sites should be integral to the entire public health activities process and
not simply performed when all other activities are completed. Sites for health education should be selected based
on public health need. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The following describes the two types of site-specific preventive health education activities.

Community Health Education_
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->
Any activity or activities directed toward the community near a site, designed to assist the community in understanding
their potential for exposure or assessing adverse health occurrence in their community and to prevent or mitigate
exposure to hazardous substances. Activities may include disseminating written materials, presenting coordinated
programs involving on-site actions and site-specific materials development (prevention oriented), or supporting
an on site health educator. It is assumed that in community health education, community members are involved in the
assessment, policy development, and assurance phases of site-specific preventive health education.

Health Professional Education_
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->
Any activity or activities directed toward educating public health professionals and the local medical community.
The purpose of these activities is to improve the knowledge, skill, and behavior of health professionals concerning
medical surveillance, screening, and methods of diagnosing, treating, and preventing injury or disease related
to exposure to hazardous substances. See

General Environmental Health Education_Programs and materials for health professionals that may not be directly
related to a site, but contribute to the base of knowledge in environmental health and help equip health professionals
to more effectively address environmental health issues. A partial list of appropriate and inappropriate topics
to be addressed by these efforts follows:

Health Activities Recommendation Panel (HARP)_This is a multidisciplinary intra-Agency panel established to
evaluate the data and information contained in public health assessments, health consultations, public health
advisories and other documents developed by ATSDR to determine public health follow-up actions_including environmental
health education_needed for communities affected by exposures to hazardous substances present at hazardous waste
sites nationwide. States funded under the health education cooperative agreement may be asked to participate in
HARP review of selected sites, when appropriate.

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Site-specific preventive health education includes activities for health professionals, communities, and that

Health professionals. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
(1) Develop for health professionals site-related educational activities. Sites to be addressed include: sites
listed or proposed for the National Priorities List (NPL); HARP-recommended sites; sites that have had consultations
or petitions, and other sites where the State and ATSDR determine health education is needed. Activities relevant
to hazardous substances found at these sites are also appropriate. Activities include grand rounds, short courses,
and workshops. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(2) Develop educational materials to improve the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
skills and knowledge of health professionals concerning potential exposure to hazardous substances at Superfund
(or HARP) sites. If non-printed materials are to be developed, the applicant must thoroughly describe the materials,
and justify their superiority over traditional educational materials.

b. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Communities. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Develop and conduct community health education activities and materials related to potential exposure to hazardous
