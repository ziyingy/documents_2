  [Text] The establishment of the Vietnamese-Dutch Trade 
Joint Venture Limited Company has initiated investment 
cooperation in bilateral transport and communications. The 
joint venture is between the Vietnamese Ministry of Transport 
and Communications and the Port and Gas Consortium of the 
Netherlands. 
  The Netherlands is one of the largest investors in Vietnam. 
At present, it has nine projects with total capitalization of 
$227 million, ranking it eighth among 42 countries in investment 
capital. It follows Taiwan, Hong Kong, France, Australia, South 
Korea, Japan, and Britain. 
  Most of the Dutch investment is in oil and gas, light 
industry, and tourism. 
  Speaking to the media in Hanoi on October 12, Dutch 
Transport 
Minister Maij-Weggen said that under the agreement on air 
services signed with Vietnam Airlines, KLM will operate two 
flights weekly from Amsterdam to Ho Chi Minh City and expand 
services to Hanoi. 
  Maij-Weggen said: Developments in Vietnam are taking place 
rapidly. In the next few years, it will be faced with difficult 
choices with which we, in Holland, are all too familiar, 
especially in your densely populated coastal areas. The 
available water is used in many different ways. In densely 
populated areas, for drinking water, for industry, and for 
fishing. On the other hand, water forms an invaluable transport 
artery. [Word indistinct] water management is therefore 
essential in order to allow all of these typical activities. 
Without being immodest, I think I can say that Holland has 
something to offer here. 
  Vietnam is striving to draw more investment capital for 
infrastructure construction, primarily for transportation and 
postal services. 
  By October 1993, the State Committee for Cooperation and 
Investment has granted licenses to 22 transportation and postal 
services projects with total capitalization of $432 million.
