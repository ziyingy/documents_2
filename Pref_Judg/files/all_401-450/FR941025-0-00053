FEMA recognizes that there are local jurisdictions that may have the resources to build and to restore flood protection
systems without Federal financial support. On the other hand, the subsidy and the less restrictive flood plain management
criteria could reduce a community's incentive to press for timely completion of its restoration project. FEMA cannot
compel the completion of a restoration project. Without Federal participation in a restoration project, the Federal
government cannot insure that the anticipated flood protection will be achieved within the time allowed by the rule.
FEMA concludes that a lack of Federal involvement in the restoration process would introduce too great an uncertainty
that the restoration projects will be completed in a timely manner. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The public policy concern is that, if restoration of the flood protection system is never completed, or is completed
only after a lengthy delay, the owners and occupants of structures built during the restoration period at elevations
below the actual 100-year flood level will permanently be at a greater risk of flooding than they would otherwise have
been, and this regulation would have contributed directly to that greater risk. This is contrary to the basic purpose
of the NFIP. (See 42 USC &sect;4001(c)). Therefore, the interim final rule retains the requirement that a Federal
agency be involved in the funding of the restoration in order to establish an essential assurance that the restoration
will be completed.

One comment requested that the regulations at 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
&sect;65.14(e)(8) allow changes to the community's adopted map or legal description that designates the ``developed
areas'' to accommodate minor errors and omissions. FEMA recognizes that errors or omissions may occur in the drafting
of a map or legal description of the designated ``developed areas'' that the community then officially adopts. In
such cases, FEMA would allow the community to submit a revised map or legal description that identifies the error or
omission. Communities would be required to submit evidence to FEMA that the specific land areas to be designated as
``developed areas'' satisfy the requirements of the definition of ``developed areas'' at the time the initial designation
was adopted. Communities would not be allowed to modify the map or legal description to redesignate ``developed areas''
at their discretion while the flood control restoration zone designation remains in effect.

One comment suggested that the regulations provide for reconsideration when the Director determines that a community
is ineligible for a flood control restoration zone designation under the provisions contained in the proposed rule
at &sect;65.14(f). The interim final rule provides for processing a community's application according to procedures
specified in existing NFIP regulations at 44 CFR 65.9. FEMA believes that these procedures are adequate. Furthermore,
there is no prohibition against resubmitting an application for AR Zone designation. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Another comment suggested that the procedures cited in the proposed regulations at &sect;65.14(i) for removing
the flood control restoration zone designation provide for a prior written notice to the community and an opportunity
to remedy the situation. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
FEMA agrees that the community should be given prior written notice of the Director's determination and an opportunity
to submit information to support retaining the AR designation. The interim final rule at &sect;65.14(i) was revised
accordingly. However, the time frame specified in the restoration plan shall not exceed the ten year maximum restoration
period. In addition, the interim final rule states that the revision of the Flood Insurance Rate Map to remove the flood
control restoration zone designation will be accomplished in accordance with the existing regulations at 44 CFR
Part 67. Finally, the term ``procedures'' has been substituted for the term ``criteria'' in the description of &sect;65.14
(h) and (i) since this term better describes the content of these sections.
