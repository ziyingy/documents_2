<F P=106> [Unnamed ITAR-TASS correspondent report: "Fewer and Fewer </F>
Children. We Are Getting Old"] 
  [Text] In 1993 the country's population fell by 300,000, 
and 1 million fewer Russians were born than in 1992. If this 
trend persists, the population of the Russian Federation will 
have halved in 50 years' time. And half of the country's 
inhabitants will be pensioners. An ITAR-TASS correspondent was 
told this at the Russian Academy of Sciences' Sociopolitical 
Research Institute. 
  Steady depopulation has been recorded in 68 regions, which 
are home to 93 percent of the entire population. Natural growth 
persists in the republics of the North Caucasus, Kalmykia, the 
Altay, Tuva, Yakutia, Chukotka, and in Tyumen and Chita Oblasts. 
This depopulation is the result not only of a wholesale fall in 
the birth rate, but of increased mortality. Life expectancy has 
fallen by 18 months; in the period 1989-1993 it fell by 0.7 of a 
year for women and by 2.2 years for men. A special feature of 
the situation in Russia is the unusually high death rate from 
accidents, poisonings, and injury. Average life expectancy for 
Russian men is 62; women outlive them by almost 12 years. 
  The scale and nature of this phenomenon require not just the 
stating of the fact, but direct state intervention.
