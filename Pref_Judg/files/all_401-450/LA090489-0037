Drawing, In its prenatal stage, the sun was a giant cloud of gas and dust, 
called a "solar nebula." Some areas were more dense than others, and they 
gradually accumulated enough material to create weak gravitational fields. ; 
Drawing, As the denser pockets grew in mass, they swirled around each other and 
ultimately merged, causing the core of the cloud to grow more compact. ; 
Drawing, In time, the inner core of the cloud collapsed from the increasingly 
strong gravitational field, causing an implosion that set off a nuclear chain 
reaction. Another star had been born. ; Drawing, After its birth, the sun was 
cloaked in a cloud of gas and dust. Fierce solar winds began sweeping the cloud 
into a flat disk that swirled around the sun's equator, setting the stage for 
the formation of the planets. ; Drawing, The planets are, in their order from 
the sun: Mercury, Venus, Earth, Mars, Jupiter, Saturn, Uranus, Neptune, Pluto.
