Your recent article concerning the property in South Laguna formerly owned by 
Richard Halliburton ("South Laguna's Forgotten Giant," Sept. 3) brought back 
nostalgic memories. 
</P>
<P>
The reporter mentioned that Halliburton had swum the Dardanelles and crossed 
the Alps on an elephant. These two observations, made in such matter-of-fact 
fashion, do not describe the reasons for those adventures. 
</P>

Halliburton swam the Hellespont (Dardanelles) to repeat the legendary 
accomplishment of Leander according to the myth of Hero and Leander. Leander 
was a Greek youth who was in love with Hero, a priestess of Aphrodite, confined 
to a temple across the Hellespont. Leander would swim the five-mile distance 
nightly, guided by a lantern placed by Hero in a tower. Unfortunately, so the 
legend goes, the lantern blew out one night in a storm, and Leander lost his 
way and perished, bringing the love affair to a tragic end.

<P>
The purpose of crossing the Alps by elephant was to follow in the footsteps of 
the Carthaginian general Hannibal who defeated the Roman armies in the second 
Punic War, in the period 218 to 202 B.C. Hannibal's feat of crossing the Alps 
to attack by land brought him victory; prior to that the wars had involved sea 
battles which cost both sides large numbers of warriors.

<P>
The reporter's unadorned factual statements that Halliburton swam the 
Hellespont and rode an elephant across the Alps do not do justice to the 
reasons for those heroic achievements. If the reporter had been at Mudville 
that fateful day, he would probably have written that "the Mudville nine lost 
after Casey struck out to end the game." But still, the article was very 
informative and interesting, and I am glad to have had a chance to read it. My 
sincere compliments to James Carlton, your staff writer for his outstanding 
article.
