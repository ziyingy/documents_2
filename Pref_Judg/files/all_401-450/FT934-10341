OCTOBER sales figures reported by some of the larger US retailers yesterday
were reinforced by a warning from Kmart, the discount store and specialty
retailing group, that its third-quarter results would show a decline in net
income.
Although Wal-Mart, the biggest US retailer, reported relatively good growth,
with same-store sales 8 per cent higher than in the same month last year,
figures from several other large retailers were weak.
Kmart said the first half of October had gone well, but unseasonably warm
weather in the second half interrupted the improvement in clothing sales
experienced since early September. Overall, same-store sales were only 1.4
per cent ahead of last year's figure.
Mr Joseph Antonini, chairman and chief executive, said: 'More seasonable
fall weather in early November has resulted in a dramatic pick-up in
business, particularly in fashion merchandise.'
However, he warned that an expected large loss at its Pace Membership
Warehouse subsidiary - sold this week to the rival Wal-Mart Stores -
together with the effects of a 1 per cent increase in the rate of US
corporate tax, would produce a fall in net income.
Federated Department Stores, owner of Bloomingdale's and other chains,
reported a 1.5 per cent decline in same-store sales, blaming sluggish
economic conditions.
Woolworth, which last month announced the closure of 970 stores in North
America, said total same-store sales were only 0.9 per cent up.
Better figures came from Sears, Roebuck, the Chicago-based department store
group, which reported a 12.7 increase in same-store sales. There was modest
growth from the JC Penney stores group, reporting a 3.6 per cent increase.
But The Gap clothing chain saw a 2 per cent sales decline on a like-for-like
basis.
