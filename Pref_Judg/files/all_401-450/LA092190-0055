Photo, A Painful Anniversary: A year has passed since Hurricane Hugo ravaged 
coastal South Carolina, but for many residents the pain and apprehension are a 
lingering legacy. Leroy and Bertha Cummings worry whenever the wind blows, 
because it brings back the furious day the storm dismantled their home and 
lives -- along with thousands of others. The Cummingses and their foster 
children, right, now live in a house trailer full of donated furnishings. There 
are other painful reminders: 29 people in South Carolina perished. STEPHANIE
