To ensure that all respondents to this notice have a common understanding of DOE's perspective on the role of IRP in
utility planning, DOE offers the following to define IRP's scope and parameters and to describe the characteristics
which distinguish IRP from traditional planning approaches. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Traditional planning techniques used by utilities once focus only on investing in supply-side resources to satisfy
customers' needs. A distinguishing factor of the IRP process is that it includes both supply- and demand-side resources
in meeting demands for utility energy services. According to Section 111 of EPAct, IRP for electric utility service
is:

A planning and selection process for new energy resources that evaluates the full range of alternatives, including
new generating capacity, power purchases, energy conservation and efficiency, cogeneration and district heating
and cooling applications, and renewable energy resources, in order to provide adequate and reliable service to its
customers at the lowest system cost.

In addition to promoting a mix of alternative resources, IRP infuses the interests of all stakeholders: Utilities,
ratepayers, regulators, stockholders, and interest groups. The following explanation of IRP, also taken from EPAct
Section 111, reflects the idea that IRP is a process that evaluates the issues raised by different stakeholders.

The Process [will] take into account necessary features for system operation, such as diversity, reliability, dispatchability,
and other factors of risk; [will] take into account the ability to verify energy savings achieved through energy conservation
and efficiency and the projected durability of such savings measured over time; [and will] treat demand and supply
resources on a consistent and integrated basis.

The DOE approach to IRP for utility and State energy planning is to treat all options_supply, storage, delivery, and
demand-side_on a consistent basis using a systems approach without preconceptions or bias for or against any particular
option, fuel type, or form of ownership. The following characteristics distinguish IRP from traditional planning
techniques.

1. IRP examines the full range of energy and capacity resources including demand-side management programs, transmission
and distribution systems, and non-traditional supply alternatives. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
2. IRP gives consideration to the full range of economic, environmental, social, and technological factors. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
3. IRP facilitates public involvement in utility planning. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
4. IRP facilitates consideration of the risks and uncertainties posed by different resource portfolios and by external
factors such as fluctuations in energy prices and economic conditions.

DOE urges those interested in responding to this notice to consider the provided definition of IRP and its characteristics
and to consider the following list of questions. DOE is also interested in gauging the evolution of IRP practices around
the nation, particularly as those practices apply to the significant changes that are likely to occur in the utility
services industry over the next several years. Therefore, DOE urges respondents to also consider each of the following
questions and explain how they might answer those questions five years from now. Respondents are asked to please include
their underlying assumptions which accompany their opinions on the future status and likely impact of IRP. This information
will enhance DOE's ability to accurately interpret the response and compare it to the opinions of other respondents.

 Has the implementation of IRP changed (or is likely to change) the per unit cost as well as the total bill for electricity
for consumers from pre-IRP levels? How, if at all, have different consumer classes or groups experienced (or are likely
to experience) changes in the cost of their electric service as a result of IRP? Are these changes good or bad and why?
What characteristics of IRP are most responsible for the changes in electricity costs which you have cited for the
previous questions? What studies, reports, or other information underlie your comments? 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
 Has the implementation of IRP enhanced or reduced (or is likely to enhance or reduce) the overall reliability of electric
service to customers? What, if any, are the IRP characteristics most responsible (or likely to be most responsible)
for a change in the level of electric service reliability since IRP has been implemented? What studies, reports, or
other information underlie your comments?
