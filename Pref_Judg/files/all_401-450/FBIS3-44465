  [Text] Washington, December 30 (XINHUA) -- Despite its 
stunning economic growth, China's per capita gross national 
product (GNP) is almost at the same level of Gambia, the tiny 
country in western Africa. 
  According to The World Bank Atlas 1994, made 
public here today, China's per capita GNP grew to 380 U.S. 
dollars by the end of 1992, an increase of 10 dollars from 1991. 
  The country at almost the same level is Gambia, whose per 
capita GNP was 390 dollars last year. In terms of per capita 
GNP, China is a bit ahead of Kenya, Guyana and Equatorial 
Guinea, each at 330 dollars. 
  However, the per capita GNP growth of China, with a 
population at 1.16 billion by the end of 1992, the last 
reporting period for the atlas, has been hovering at around six 
percent from 1985 to 1992. 
  The atlas, with color maps and charts on various topics, is 
regarded as a treasure trove of information on 207 countries and 
has become an international standard in statistical compilations 
over the past 25 years. 
  As comparison, the per capita GNP for India, the second most 
populous country in the world, was 310 dollars in 1992, a 
decrease of 20 dollars from 1991. 
  Meanwhile, China's average inflation rate from 1985 to 1992 
was 7.5 percent, according to the atlas. 
  The atlas said that the total fertility rate of China, whose 
family planning policy is called "one child per couple", was 2.4 
births per woman in 1992, its infant mortality rate was 38 per 
1,000 live births. 
  However, China's primary school enrollment was a 
satisfactory 
100 percent, the atlas showed, although its illiteracy rate was 
27 percent at the time of reporting. 
  Reports from Beijing said that China's economic growth is 
expected to top 13 percent this year, as compared with 12.8 
percent last year, making China the world's fastest growing 
country. 
  According to the World Bank, those with per capita GNP at 
lower than 675 dollars are regarded as low-income countries. 
Those with income levels at between 676 and 2,695 dollars are 
called lower- middle-income countries. 
  In 1992, the atlas showed, there are 57 low-income countries 
and 69 lower-middle-income countries in the world.
