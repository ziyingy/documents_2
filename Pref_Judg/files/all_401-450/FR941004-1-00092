At the heart of the State and Indian tribal plans are the child and family services. Paragraph (n) requires a description
of the publicly funded child and family services that will be provided in FY 1995 and FY 1996, based on the requirement
for a description of the family preservation and family support services in section 432(a)(5) of the Act and for a description
of the child welfare services in section 422(b)(5) of the Act.

Specifically, the State's CFSP must describe the publicly funded child and family services continuum to be provided
in FY 1995 and FY 1996: the family support services; the family preservation services; the child welfare services
(including child abuse and neglect prevention, intervention, and treatment services and foster care); and the services
to support reunification, adoption, kinship care, independent living, or other permanent living arrangement.

The Indian tribe's CFSP must describe the child welfare (including the child abuse and neglect prevention, intervention,
and treatment services and foster care) and/or the family support and family preservation services to be provided
in FY 1995 and FY 1996.

In addition, we propose in paragraph (n)(3), that for each service, the CFSP must indicate the population(s) to be
served; the geographic areas where services will be available; the estimated number of individuals and/or families
to be served; and the estimated expenditures for these services from Federal, State, local, and donated sources.

This would include, among other sources of funds, expenditure data on title IV-B, subparts 1 and 2, on the two CAPTA
programs, and on the Independent Living Program. Expenditure data must include all services expenditures, i.e.,
those funded directly and those funded through subrecipients.

We believe that this description of services represents one of the most important sections of the CFSP. Not only will
it provide a comprehensive picture of the services provided and resources available, it can clearly illustrate State
and Indian tribal decision-making in directing services toward the goals and objectives in the CFSP. By providing
a unified picture of the services available, it will form a basis for discussion of future coordination of services
and improved service delivery. This information also will be studied by national evaluators and other researchers.

We believe the requirements of paragraph (n) will not be burdensome as much of the information on child protective
services, child welfare services, foster care, and adoption is already being reported on the current CWS&hyph;101,
the Annual Summary of Child Welfare Services (OMB approval no. 0980&hyph;0047, expiration date 9/30/95). We propose
to add in the CFSP reporting of information on CAPTA and ILP services (which is currently available). Information
will be reported for the first time on new or expanded family support and family preservation services using subpart
2 funds.

We have drafted a revised CWS&hyph;101 form for illustrative purposes. It is included as an Appendix to the NPRM, but
it will not become a permanent part of the final rule or the Code of Federal Regulations. We welcome suggestions for
additions or improvements in the scope of the description of services.
