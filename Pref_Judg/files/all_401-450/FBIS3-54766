  [Text] The St. Andrew flag was put down in the Admiral 
Fokin missile cruiser. The press office of the Kamchatka 
flotilla said that the ship was written off. 
  The cruiser was built in Leningrad in 1960 and has been in 
service since June 1963. Within the 30 years it made 14 distant 
voyages. The ship will most probably be sold for scrap.
