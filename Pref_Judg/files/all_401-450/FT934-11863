THE Church of England's General Synod did not exceed its powers when it
asked parliament to approve a legislative measure for the ordination of
women, the High Court said yesterday.
It ruled against the Church Society, which had argued that an act of
parliament was needed to sanction the move as it amounted to a 'funda mental
change' in Church doctrine. The Church Society said it would not appeal.
