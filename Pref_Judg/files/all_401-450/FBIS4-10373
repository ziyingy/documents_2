  [Text] All indications point to the fact that Cuba will not 
be able to offer the necessary guarantees to buy approximately 
20,000 barrels of oil per day [bpd] from Colombia. Such a deal 
can only be carried out if the Cuban Government offers a letter 
of credit to Colombia -- that is, if an international bank 
finances its debt. 
  According to a study to which EL TIEMPO has gained access, 
the banks are not interested in backing Cuban debts. In fact, 
countries such as Iran and Libya suspended their supply of crude 
because of a lack of financial guarantees. 
  Although the situation improved somewhat after Russia 
resumed 
the commercial exchange of oil with Cuba in January 1994, Cuba 
still is not in any position to pay for imports. Russia will 
sell Cuba 4.0 million tons of unrefined crude in exchange for 
1.5 million tons of sugar this year. 
  The government of Fidel Castro prefers to offer Colombia a 
three-way exchange system. This means that the companies to 
which Cuba sells sugar would, in turn, pay Colombia for the 
crude. Many of the countries that receive sugar in exchange for 
oil have suspended these kinds of deals because of Cuba's 
enormous debts and because there is a surplus of sugar, and 
future production is in jeopardy. This suspension of imports 
heightens the already difficult energy situation. Cuba only has 
resources to supply 40 percent of its oil needs. 
  Even with Colombian oil, the crisis would not be resolved. 
Rather than crude, what Cuba needs is fuel, particularly fuel 
oil and diesel, to generate electricity and to compensate for 
its lack of hydraulic sources of power. This is because Cuban 
refineries are also in a state of crisis. 
  The plants in Havana and Santiago (built by Exxon and Shell) 
reportedly produce 30,000 bpd but are currently at a standstill. 
The Havana plant requires investments in the order of $100 
million, while the Santiago plant needs a $75 million investment 
to operate efficiently. Another Soviet-built plant, with the 
same capacity, and another located in Matanzas (which reportedly 
generates 5,000 bpd) are also at a standstill because of a lack 
of maintenance. 
  The new refinery located in Cienfuegos has the capacity to 
produce 60,000 bpd, but it is not operational right now and 
requires an investment of approximately $200 million to produce 
commercially viable gasoline. 
  Difficulties in generating electricity have forced Cuba to 
obtain gasoline through four international companies (Marc Rich, 
Vitol, Mabanet, and Totisa) which receive sugar and nickel as 
payment for their exports. According to the document, however, 
even refined imports have been reduced. These are now limited 
to the volumes of sugar and nickel that Cuba can offer. For 
this reason, the document questions Colombia's willingness to 
sell oil to Cuba "while other countries have decided to suspend 
sales."
