The European Commission is sharply criticised for its shipping policy, in
the annual report of the A P Moller group, which operates one of the world's
largest merchant fleets.
Moller claims that, because of Commission policies, shipping business and
jobs are being exported to the Far East. The Commission, says Moller, 'has
cast doubt on the right of the liner shipping companies to rationalise their
operations and hence for the European companies to operate profitable liner
services to Europe.'
This refers to a claim by the Commission, in a current dispute with the
container-carrying liner shipping companies, that the companies can only
offer rates from port to port, not from the point of production of goods to
the final destination. The Commission maintains that this practice distorts
competition with land-based hauliers.
The liner shipping companies have always offered customers transport, not
only from port to port but also from the inland point of production to the
inland point of reception.
The Commission is trying to stop this natural service to customers, which is
'difficult to understand,' says Moller.
'The consequence is that a growing share of this trade, and therefore an
increasing number of jobs, (is) being exported to Far Eastern shipping
conmpanies,' says the Danish group.
