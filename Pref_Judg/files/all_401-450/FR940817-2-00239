<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
From a methodologic standpoint, human laboratory studies 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
can be divided into two categories_between-subjects and within-subjects designs. In the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
former, the neurobehavioral performance of exposed volunteers is compared with that of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
nonexposed participants. In the latter, preexposure performance is compared with 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
neurobehavioral function under the influence of the chemical or drug. Within-subjects 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
designs have the advantage of requiring fewer participants, eliminating individual differences 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
as a source of variability, and controlling for chronic mediating variables, such as caffeine 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
use and educational achievement. A disadvantage of the within-subjects design is that 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
neurobehavioral tests must be administered more than once. Practice on many 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
neurobehavioral tests often leads to improved performance that may confound the effect of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the chemical/drug. It is important to allow a sufficient number of test sessions in the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
preexposure phase of the study to allow performance on all tests to achieve a relatively stable 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
baseline level.

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Participants in laboratory exposure studies may 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
be recruited from populations of persons already exposed to the chemical/drug or from naive 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
populations. Although the use of exposed volunteers has ethical advantages, can militate 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
against novelty effects, and allows evaluation of tolerance/sensitization, finding an accessible 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
exposed population in reasonable proximity to the laboratory is difficult. Naive participants 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
are more easily recruited, but may differ significantly in important characteristics from a 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
representative sample of exposed persons. Naive volunteers are often younger, healthier, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
and better educated than the populations exposed environmentally, in the workplace, or 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
pharmacotherapeutically. For example, phase I drug trial data from relatively young and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
healthy volunteers may not adequately predict the incidence of neurotoxic side effects in 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
older persons with chronic health problems.

3.4.2.3. Exposure conditions and chemical classes.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Compared with workplace and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
environmental exposures, laboratory exposure conditions can be controlled more precisely, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
but exposure periods are much shorter. Generally only one or two relatively pure chemicals 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
are studied for several hours while the population of interest may be exposed to multiple 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
chemicals containing impurities for months or years. Laboratory studies are therefore better 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
at identifying and characterizing effects with acute onset and the selective effects of pure 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
agents. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Most laboratory studies of neurobehavioral function have employed individual 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
solvents, combinations of two solvents, or very low concentrations of chemicals released 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
from household and office materials (volatile organic compounds). This selection is 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
primarily because solvent effects are reversible, because there are wide margins of safety for 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
acute effects of solvents, because solvents can be administered via inhalation methods that 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
allow calculation of body concentrations by breath sampling methods that do not require 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
needle sticks, because over 1 million workers may have occupational solvent exposure, and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
because of the extensive use of solvents in household products. Chemicals studied in the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
laboratory over the past 40 years have included ozone, NO

, CO, styrene, lead, anesthetic 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
gases, pesticides, irritants, chlorofluorocarbon compounds, and propylene glycol dinitrite. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Caffeine, diazepam, and ethanol have been used in laboratory studies as positive control 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
substances.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Neurobehavioral test methods may be selected according to several 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
strategies. A test battery that examines multiple neurobehavioral functions may be more 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
useful for screening and the initial characterization of acute effects. Selected neurobehavioral 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
tests that measure a more limited number of functions in multiple ways may be more useful 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
for elucidating mechanisms or validating specific effects.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Both chemical and behavioral control procedures are valuable for 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
examining the specificity of the effects. A concordant effect among different measures of the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
same neurobehavioral function (e.g., reaction time) and a lack of effect on some other 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
measures of psychomotor function (e.g., untimed manual dexterity) would increase the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
confidence in a selective effect on motor speed and not on attention or on nonspecific motor 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
function. Likewise, finding concordant effects among similar chemical or drug classes along 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
with different effects from dissimilar classes would support the specificity of chemical effect. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
For example, finding that the effects of a solvent were similar to those of ethanol but not 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
caffeine would support the specificity of solvent effects on a given measure of neurotoxicity.

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Most human exposure studies in the laboratory have been justified 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
on the basis of data indicating that the chemical or drug exposure produces only temporary 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
and reversible functional effects. The use of occupationally, environmentally, or 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
therapeutically exposed populations as a source of participants also makes the risks from 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
research exposure small relative to nonlaboratory sources of risk. Protection of human 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
subjects is also provided by the informed consent process; the health risks (known and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
unknown) and benefits of the research are thoroughly explained to each participant, who may 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
terminate participation in the study at any time. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Despite safeguards, several chemicals and drugs thought at the time of the exposure 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
study to produce only temporary neurobehavioral effects are now (20 years later) suspected 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
of being potential human carcinogens on the basis of animal and human data (e.g., methylene 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
chloride, perchloroethylene). Other chemicals, however, are now thought to be less 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
carcinogenic or otherwise less toxic in humans than once believed. Rapid advances in all 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
areas of toxicology make it difficult to communicate, to potential subjects, reliable 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
information about the likelihood of long-term, latent, or delayed adverse effects on health 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
subsequent to the study. The communication of uncertainty about potential long-term effects 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
to research participants is essential if human exposure studies are to be conducted ethically 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
and are to continue their contributions to neurotoxicology and risk assessment.

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
While adult neurotoxicology evaluates the effects of chemical exposure on relatively 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
stable nervous system structure and function, developmental neurotoxicology addresses the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
special vulnerabilities of the young and the old. Neurobehavioral assessment of chemical 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
neurotoxicity is complicated by having to measure functional impairment within a sequential 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
progression of emergence, maturation, and gradual decline of nervous system capabilities. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Methods in developmental neurotoxicity assessment must reflect the diversity of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
neurobehavioral functions, from neonates to the elderly. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Exposure of pregnant women to alcohol, drugs of abuse, therapeutic drugs, nicotine, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
and environmental chemicals may result in the immediate or delayed appearance of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
neurobehavioral impairment in children (Kimmel, 1988; Nelson, 1991a). Postnatal exposure 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
of children to chemical agents in the environment, such as lead, also may impair IQ and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
other indices of neurobehavioral function (Needleman et al., 1979). Neurotoxic effects may 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
impair speech and language, attention, general intelligence, ``state'' regulation and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
responsiveness to external stimulation, learning and memory, sensory and motor skills, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
visuospatial processing, affect and temperament, and responsiveness to nonverbal social 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
stimuli. Chemical neurotoxicity may be manifested as decreases in functional capabilities or 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
delays in normative developmental progression. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Neurotoxic effects are not limited to direct exposure of the fetus or child to the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
chemical. Animal studies suggest that altered neurobehavioral development in offspring may 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
result from exposure of males (Joffe and Soyka, 1981) and females to chemical substances 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
prior to conception. In this case, altered postnatal development may reflect chemical 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
influences on mechanisms of inheritance, copulatory behavior, nutritional status, hormonal 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
status, or the uterine environment. In animals and humans, chemical exposure of parents 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
may indirectly impair postnatal development through changes in milk composition, parenting 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
behaviors, and other aspects of the environment.
