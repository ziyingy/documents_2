3.6.1.1. Sensitivity. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Individual neurobehavioral tests and test batteries have detected 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
differences between exposed and nonexposed populations in epidemiologic studies and in 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
laboratory studies. Effects have been detected by neurobehavioral methods at concentrations 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
thought by other kinds of evaluation not to produce neurotoxicity. Workplace exposure 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
limits to many chemicals have been set on the basis of neurobehavioral studies. While the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
overall sensitivity of neurobehavioral methods is sufficient to be useful in neurotoxicology 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
risk assessment, some methods are notably insensitive across several chemical classes while 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the sensitivity of other neurobehavioral tests varies according to the spectrum of neurotoxic 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
effects of the chemical or drug. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Sensitivity is sometimes negatively correlated with reliability; selecting for tests that 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
show little change over time may also select for tests that are not sensitive to neurotoxic 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
insult. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Having more control over the testing environment and using a repeated measures 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
design may decrease variability and increase statistical power, but these tactics may introduce 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
other problems. There is some suggestion that experience in highly structured laboratory 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
environments with explicit stimulus conditions may reduce the sensitivity of humans and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
animals to the effects of drugs and chemicals, and the sensitivity of neurobehavioral 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
measures to impairment by a chemical or drug may depend on neurobehavioral training 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
history (Terrace, 1963; Brady and Barrett, 1986). Sensitivity may also be decreased if 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
baseline behaviors are stable and well practiced or an escape/avoidance procedure is 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
employed. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The systematic introduction of stimulus or response changes to induce transitional 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
behaviors, such as in a transitional state or repeated learning paradigms, may be one way to 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
retain the advantage of a stable baseline, have sufficient sensitivity, and avoid practice effects 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(Anger and Setzer, 1979).

3.6.1.2. Specificity. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
There are two kinds of specificity in neurobehavioral assessment of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
chemical or drug neurotoxicity. Chemical specificity refers to the ability of a test to reflect 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
chemical or drug effects and to be relatively resistant to the influence of nonchemical 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
variables. The second type of specificity refers to the ability of a test method to measure 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
changes in a single neurobehavioral function (e.g., dexterity) or a restricted number of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
functions, rather than a broad range of functions (attention, reasoning, dexterity, and vision). 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The neurobehavioral expression of neurotoxic chemical or drug effects is a function of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the joint interaction of ongoing nervous system processes with the chemical substance and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
with biopsychosocial variables that also influence nervous system activity. In laboratory 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
exposure studies numerous environmental, behavioral, and biologic variables can influence 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the type or magnitude of neurotoxic effects of chemical agents and drugs (MacPhail, 1990). 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
These variables include ambient temperature, physical workload, task difficulty, the social 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
and tangible reward characteristics of the laboratory setting, redundancy of stimuli, the rate 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
and form of the behavioral response, conditioning factors, and the interoceptive stimulus 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
properties of the chemicals. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The laboratory research participant's history and habits outside the laboratory also 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
may affect chemical-neurobehavioral interactions by influencing the baseline level of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
performance on neurobehavioral tests or directly affecting the response of the CNS to the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
exposure. Age, gender, educational level, intellectual functioning, economic status, acute 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
and chronic health conditions (including developmental or current neurologic conditions), 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
alcohol/drug/tobacco effects or withdrawal, emotional status or significant life events, sleep 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
deprivation, fatigue, and cultural factors are only a few of the variables that may affect 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
performance in laboratory studies (Williamson, 1991; Cassitto et al., 1990). 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The influence of these selection and biopsychosocial variables on the neurobehavioral 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
effects of workplace chemicals is poorly understood, although their effects on drug-behavior 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
interactions have been more thoroughly explored. Controlling or understanding chemical and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
nonchemical variables will be important for ensuring adequate specificity for risk assessment 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
purposes.

3.6.1.3. Reliability and validity. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Reliability refers to the ability of a given test to produce 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
closely similar results when administered more than once over a period of time or in similar 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
populations. Reliability is meaningful only with respect to the measurement of functions that 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
would not be expected to change significantly over the time period. Test-retest reliability 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
coefficients are between 0.6 and 0.9 (Beaumont, 1990) for most of the tests in the NCTB. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
With notable exceptions, other neurobehavioral tests have similar reliabilities. Reliabilities in 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the 0.8 to 0.9 range are usually thought acceptable. As reliability decreases, measurement 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
error is more likely to mask neurotoxic chemical effects.
