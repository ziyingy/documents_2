The Dutch shipping and road-haulage group is expected to show a further
rebound in profits when it publishes second-quarter results on Wednesday.
The company, which launched quarterly reporting earlier this year, swung
into a slim Fl 10m (Dollars 5.6m) profit in the first quarter from losses in
1993. The pace of recovery is expected to have accelerated in the second
quarter, thanks to strong growth in world trade flows and firmer shipping
rates.
