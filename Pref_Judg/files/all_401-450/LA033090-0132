Photo, NEW YORK'S NEW GUARD: Gordon Henderson, left, who's known for sports 
wear in unexpected colors, shows '50s campus, stadium, lodge and homecoming 
looks for fall. Michael Leva, below left, says he has a "slightly" Renaissance 
theme for his fall collection: tunics, dark colors, bloomers and swingy shapes. 
Rebecca Moses, below, favors a Sherlock Holmes theme for fall: There are caped 
coats over shorts, and a mix of plaids with checks. Carmelo Pomodoro, below 
right, has two themes for fall: chic survival, with sporty looks, and '60s 
inspired granny chic, including crocheted shawls. Jennifer George, right, 
offers updated mod looks for fall, with lots of short shorts worn over ribbed 
tights and short, heeled boots. TIMOTHY HAWKINS
