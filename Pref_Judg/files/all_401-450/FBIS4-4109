  [Text] Beijing, April 28 (XINHUA) -- The U.S. Government 
should keep to its commitment on the issue of Tibet and refrain 
from doing anything that will harm the Sino-U.S. relations, 
said Wu Jianmin, spokesman for the Chinese Ministry of Foreign 
Affairs, at a news briefing here today. 
  The meeting with the Dalai Lama by an official of any 
country 
means instigation and support to the separationist activities of 
the Dalai Lama and constitutes an interference in the internal 
affairs of China, Wu said. It will be met with resolute 
opposition from the Chinese people. 
  Mr. Wu Jianmin made the statements when asked to comment on 
the report about U.S. President Clinton's meeting with the 
Dalai Lama. 
  The Dalai Lama is not only a religious leader, but also a 
political exile, Mr. Wu said. He has long been engaging in 
activities designed to split the country and undermine the 
national unity. 
  "All his activities have brought harm to the interests of 
all 
the Chinese people, including the Tibetan compatriots," Wu said. 
  "We hope that the U.S. Government will keep to its 
commitment on the Tibetan issue and refrain from doing anything 
that will harm the Sino-U.S. relations," Wu said.
