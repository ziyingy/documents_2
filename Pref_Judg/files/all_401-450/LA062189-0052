Former chiefs of federal organized crime strike forces warned Tuesday that 
Atty. Gen. Dick Thornburgh's plan to merge the special units into U.S. 
attorneys' offices will lead experienced anti-mob prosecutors to leave the 
government in droves. 
</P>
<P>
Edward A. McDonald, who headed the Brooklyn strike force for seven years until 
he entered private practice this month, told the House Judiciary subcommittee 
on criminal justice that most of his former colleagues in that office "are out 
looking for jobs" because of Thornburgh's controversial decision. 
</P>
<P>
Jane Serene, a former strike force prosecutor in Boston and a special counsel 
in the Justice Department's criminal division, said that Thornburgh's move will 
result in "an exodus of a wealth of talented prosecutors." 
</P>
<P>
The loss of "institutional memory" will lessen the chances that a wiretapped 
conversation referring to "a mob hit 20 years ago" will be recognized as such 
by less experienced prosecutors, she said. 
</P>
<P>
But David Runkel, Thornburgh's chief spokesman, said that he has had no 
indication that any of the 125 strike force lawyers across the country will 
quit rather than transfer to special organized crime units inside the U.S. 
attorneys' offices. 
</P>
<P>
"If they are committed to the fight against organized crime, I assume they'll 
stay," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Rep. Charles E. Schumer (D-N. Y.), chairman of the subcommittee, said that he 
was "puzzled" by Thornburgh's announcement of his decision Monday on the eve of 
the scheduled subcommittee hearings. 
</P>
<P>
"I believed that he would wait until both sides could publicly air their views 
before finalizing his plans," Schumer said. "Unfortunately, he appears to have 
made his decision before public hearings can even begin." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Stiff Opposition Likely 
</P>
<P>
The sharply critical testimony and Schumer's dismay over Thornburgh's timing 
indicate that the attorney general's plan faces stiff opposition. Some 
senators, including Sam Nunn (D-Ga.), Strom Thurmond (R-S. C.), Edward M. 
Kennedy (D-Mass.) and Arlen Specter (R-Pa.), had urged Thornburgh to hold off 
on his decision. A joint hearing by the Senate Judiciary Committee and the 
Governmental Affairs permanent investigations subcommittee is expected next 
month. 
</P>
<P>
Schumer noted that a supplemental appropriation sought by the Justice 
Department and scheduled to be taken up by the House today bars any 
reorganization in the department until Oct. 1. Thornburgh has said that he 
expects to implement the merger no later than Oct. 1. 
</P>
<P>
Edward S. G. Dennis, assistant attorney general in charge of the Justice 
Department's criminal division, defended the planned merger as a way to end 
turf wars between strike force leaders and U.S. attorneys and to achieve 
greater efficiency in the fight against the Mafia and newly emerging organized 
crime groups. 
</P>
<P>
"The question is are we going to spend 30% of our time arguing over whose case 
it is or are we going out to make that case," Dennis told the subcommittee. 
</P>
<P>
Strike force attorneys are "professionals," Dennis said, adding: "When the gun 
sounds, I think we'll all be on the mark." 
</P>
<P>
But Peter F. Vaira, who served as U.S. attorney in Philadelphia and headed 
strike forces in Chicago and Philadelphia, disputed Dennis' contention that, 
once the strike forces are folded into special units inside U.S. attorneys' 
offices, they will be able to maintain the fight against organized crime. 
</P>
<P>
"I guarantee you that three years from now it will take the FBI to find the 
strike forces," he said. 
</P>
<P>
"A U.S. attorney always needs experienced attorneys to work on priority cases 
such as local political corruption," Vaira said. "It is only a matter of time 
until the best and most experienced attorneys will be working on the 'hot' 
cases and younger, less experienced attorneys will be assigned to develop 
organized crime cases that require years of work and may be brought in another 
district."
