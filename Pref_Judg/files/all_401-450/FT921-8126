THE RUSSIAN authorities said yesterday sugar refinery output had reached a
historic low but that relief was on its way in the form of imports from Cuba
and France.
Mr Vasili Severin, head of the sugar production department at the Russian
agriculture ministry, told Itar-Tass that only four of 95 refineries were
functioning because of a shortfall of raw sugar. He said refineries had last
year received only 4m tonnes of the 7.5m tonnes of raw sugar they were
supposed to receive under the state plan.
His deputy, Mr Anatoly Kholudov, said that the 'situation with sugar was
serious' and that supplies would be worse this year than last. But he added
that some more plants would be opened in March to process imported supplies.
Mr Severin said the first shipments would arrive from Cuba and France in
late February.
Prodintorg, a state trading body, said it was talking with more potential
suppliers but declined to give details.
Mr Boris Orlov, head of the government's department for agricultural
products, said that sugar refining was a seasonal process and that only a
few more refineries would be open at this time of year any way. 'The plants
usually function for three to four months starting in September.' He said
Russia required 7m tonnes of raw sugar this year, some of which would
materialise only this autumn.
He said the shortfall was caused by producers' refusal to sell raw sugar to
the state because they were waiting for prices to rise. They had sold their
raw sugar to private markets instead. Mr Alexei Ulyuakev, an adviser to the
Russian government, said earlier this week the government was considering
liberalising from next month the prices of sugar and vegetable oil, two
commodities which are in particularly short supply in the shops.
