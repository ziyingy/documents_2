Merseyside Development Corporation yesterday appeared before the Commons
public accounts committee to defend its involvement in the lossmaking 1992
Tall Ships regatta on the Mersey, and the associated operatic concert.
Mr Chris Farrow, corporation chief executive, said the corporation had not
known the extent of the losses until the events themselves.
In spite of ticket revenue between Pounds 470,000 and Pounds 500,000, there
was a final shortfall of Pounds 375,000.
