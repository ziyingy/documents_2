THE lower house of the Dutch parliament yesterday voted to ratify the
Schengen treaty on eliminating border controls in the heart of the European
Community.
The treaty removes border controls between eight of the 12 EC states.
To take effect, all five original signatories - France, Germany, Belgium,
Luxembourg and the Netherlands - must ratify it. Belgium and Germany still
have to put the treaty to the vote. Spain, Portugal and Italy also belong to
the Schengen group.
The Dutch vote of 123 in favour and 23 against the treaty in the 150-seat
lower chamber brings to an end a prolonged and sometimes hotly-engaged
debate on its future.
Ten backbench MPs of the Labour-Christian Democrat coalition rebelled
against the government and cast votes against the Schengen treaty. It is
expected to be ratified by the upper chamber in the autumn.
Some Dutch parliamentarians objected because of its stricter procedures for
refugees seeking asylum in Europe and for the way it was negotiated without
prior parliamentary control. Last year, the Council of State, the highest
government advisory body, also criticised some of its provisions.
The agreement is named after a village in Luxembourg where the original
treaty was signed in 1985. Since then Italy, Spain and Portugal have joined
the group.
Greece has observer status, leaving Britain and Ireland as the only EC
members completely outside the Schengen group.
