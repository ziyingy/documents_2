RULES governing ships' rights of passage in foreign waters were described as
'very odd' by Lord Donaldson on the first day of his inquiry into the Braer
disaster.
The former Master of the Rolls, investigating the incident in January in
which the Liberian-registered tanker spilled 85,000 tonnes of crude oil
after breaking up in storms off Shetland, was seeking clarification of the
rights of passage of ships in another country's territorial waters.
He was told by Foreign Office international law experts that ships do not
necessarily have to tell the sovereign state when they are passing through.
Lord Donaldson said: 'The idea that you can go through territorial waters
without saying who you are or what you are does seem to me to be very odd.'
He then asked if the British government would have the right, for example,
to send a warship through French territorial waters.
When told that the government could do this, Lord Donaldson replied: 'I
would have thought a destroyer dredging along one mile off the French coast
might cause some excitement.' Lord Donaldson has already considered
substantial written evidence submitted in advance of today's yesterday's
opening of the inquiry.
He was appointed by John MacGregor, the transport secretary, 'to advise on
whether any further measures are appropriate and feasible to protect the UK
coastline from pollution from merchant shipping', and to give 'due
consideration to the international and economic implications of any new
measures'.
