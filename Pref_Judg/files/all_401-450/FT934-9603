The wrecked Latvian factory ship Lunokhod lies aground yesterday off the
Shetlands after a three-hour rescue operation, involving coastguard and RAF
helicopters, Lerwick lifeboat and a Royal Navy fishery protection ship. The
operation is believed to have saved all 60 crew. Gale force winds had jammed
the 250-foot ship onto rocks off the island of Bressay, 1 1/2 miles
south-east of Lerwick
