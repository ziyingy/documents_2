The U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service proposed opening the forests around 
Yellowstone and Grand Teton national parks to controlled hunting of grizzly 
bears that menace people or livestock. The huge bears are protected under the 
federal Endangered Species Act, although limited hunting is allowed in 
northwestern Montana and Alaska. The plan, which is open to public comment for 
60 days, would allow hunters to take "nuisance" grizzlies in more than 10 
million acres of southwestern Montana, northwestern Wyoming and eastern Idaho.
