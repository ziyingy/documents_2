Texaco, the US oil company that is going through a big restructuring,
appears to have found a buyer for its world-wide lubricant additive business
in the shape of Shell Oil, the US arm of the Royal Dutch/Shell group.
Two Shell Oil subsidiaries, Shell Chemical and Shell International Chemical,
said they were in exclusive negotiations with Texaco to buy the lubricant
additive business with a view to merging it with their own chemicals
operations.
No price was disclosed, but the business had earlier been valued at about
Dollars 200m.
Lubricant additives are used to enhance the performance of automotive and
industrial oils. Texaco's three plants - in Port Arthur, Texas, Rio de
Janeiro, Brazil and Ghent, Belgium - make additives for automotive
transmission fluids, motor oil, tractor hydraulic fluids and various types
of gear oil.
The business came on to the market in April this year when Texaco sold its
chemical business to Huntsman Corporation of the US. Huntsman originally
agreed to buy the entire business for Dollars 1.06bn, but instead paid
Dollars 850m and asked Texaco to help it find a buyer for the lubricant
additives segment.
Since then Texaco has announced another restructuring involving 2,500 job
cuts and the sale of half its US oilfields.
