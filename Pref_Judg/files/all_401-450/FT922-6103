SLIGHT weakness, or consolidation after recent gains ruled in northern
Europe yesterday, but Milan and Madrid both managed to close higher, writes
Our Markets Staff.
FRANKFURT settled for a moderate consolidation, the DAX index closing 4.91
lower at 1,806.66 after a 0.25 rise to 725.26 in the FAZ at midsession.
Volume fell slightly from DM7.7bn to DM7.6bn.
The more broadly based FAZ index, which has lagged behind the blue chip DAX
during the market's recent rally, actually hit a new 1992 high yesterday.
Not all of its constituents were so lucky.
Lufthansa, the airline which produced poor results earlier this month, hit a
new low of DM126.50, down DM5.50 yesterday compared with a 1992 high of
DM181.50. In a similar, but less severely disappointing category, the
engineer, Deutsche Babcock, dropped DM3.70 to DM163.
Generally, pre-bourse optimism generated by a slowdown in inflation in the
state of Hesse failed to result in follow-up buying orders; and Hesse's fall
from an inflation rate of 4.5 per cent in April to 4.1 per cent in May was
countered later by Baden-Wurttemberg, where the rate rose from 4.3 to 4.4
per cent.
Nevertheless, there was more confidence about economic recovery prospects
and an eventual fall in interest rates; utility companies, interest rate
sensitive, bucked the weaker trend with RWE rising DM3.70 to DM413.20.
In engineering MAN rose another DM7 to DM397 on good prospects for the
current year and, in banking, Bayernhypo rose DM5 to DM412.50 on what was
conventionally put down to good first quarter results; Ms Barbara Altmann,
of B Metzler in Frankfurt, said the figures were in the price and that
financial technicians were buying the shares for the dividend about to be
paid.
PARIS seemed to be slightly unnerved by the capital increases announced by
Bouygues yesterday and Alcatel Cable on Monday, with Lafarge Coppee rumoured
to be in line for a FFr5bn issue in the near future. As a result the CAC-40
index lost 16.67 to 2,029.58 in turnover of some FFr2.34bn.
Bouygues, FFr13 off at FFr632, was also reported as saying that negotiations
between Eurotunnel and its contractors were deadlocked which could threaten
the survival of the project. Eurotunnel was 50 centimes weaker at FFr37.85.
Alcatel Alsthom, parent of Alcatel Cable, lost FFr9 to FFr649 on news of its
subsidiary's capital increase; Lafarge shed FFr6.60 to FFr374.40.
However, one of the biggest losses on the day was recorded by LVMH as the
market reacted to Monday's news that the outlook for 1992 was not promising.
Its shares closed down FFr110 or 2.6 per cent to FFr4,085 with some analysts
saying that 1992 earnings will have to be downgraded.
Oil stocks continued to buck the market with Elf up FFr1.50 at FFr398.40 and
Total rising FFr5.30 to FFr267.80.
MILAN extended its rally to a fourth session, the Comit index closing 1.56
higher at 497.25 following the election of Mr Oscar Luigi Scalfaro as
president on Monday. Volume was estimated at around Monday's L113bn.
Industrials tried to take the initiative again, but largely failed to do so.
Fiat closed L59 higher at L5,394 but slipped to L5,355 on the kerb.
AMSTERDAM weakened slightly in late trading and the CBS Tendency index
closed down 0.1 at 130.9.
Royal Dutch saw strong foreign interest, gaining Fl 4.20 to Fl 158.60.
Elsewhere Nedlloyd, which holds its annual meeting today, was 50 cents
weaker at Fl 60.50, Buehrmann-Tetterode suffered from profit-taking and shed
Fl 1.10 to Fl 52.40 and Elsevier lost Fl 1.70 to Fl 113.50.
Hunter Douglas, which announced that it is to begin trading in London, was
up Fl 1.90 at Fl 74.20, while Fokker lost 50 cents to Fl 34.80 as Deutsche
Aerospace said that it hoped to complete its acquisition of a 51 per cent
stake by mid-June.
STOCKHOLM was cautious ahead of the Electrolux first-quarter results, which
arrived after the close. The Affarsvarlden General index fell 6.7 to 991.1,
with turnover moderate at SKr434m.
Electrolux, the white goods major, saw its B shares lose SKr4 to SKr283
ahead of profits which were about 10 per cent below expectations. The real
loser of the day was the banking and finance sector, which fell by 3.6 per
cent; analysts said that the decline was due more to program trading than
any new discouraging news.
MADRID was held up by Telefonica's surprise news, after Monday's close, that
it would lift its 1991 dividend to Pta59 from Pta55. Its shares closed up
Pta25 at Pta1,165 while the general index put on 0.20 to 258.90 in low
volume of some Pta5.8bn.
