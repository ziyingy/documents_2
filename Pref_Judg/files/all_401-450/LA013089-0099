<P>
A commission including three former Presidents today proposed a national health 
care system that would ensure access to basic medical services for all 
Americans with financing by all but the poorest. 
</P>
<P>
The system is designed to extend health care to the estimated 37 million 
Americans who are uninsured, to curtail soaring health costs and to improve the 
quality of medical care nationwide, said the National Leadership Commission on 
Health Care. 
</P>
<P>
The proposed "strategy of providing access by asking every American to take 
responsibility for his or her own care and to assume a very small share of the 
cost of those who cannot assume that responsibility is eminently fair," the 
commission said in its report. 
</P>
<P>
Without change in the nation's health care system, costs are expected to grow 
from the current $550 billion a year to $1.5 trillion by the year 2000, said 
Paul G. Rogers, a former Democratic congressman from Florida who co-chaired the 
commission with former Iowa Gov. Robert D. Ray, a Republican. 
</P>
<P>
The commission, supported by 38 corporations, unions and foundations, spent 2 
1/2 years preparing the report. Three former Presidents -- Richard M. Nixon, 
Gerald R. Ford and Jimmy Carter -- served as honorary co-chairmen. 
</P>

<P>
Role for Private Insurance 
</P>
<P>
The proposed system would continue a major role for private insurance coverage 
and would encourage employers to extend such coverage to more employees. 
</P>
<P>
All Americans would be covered by a basic package of medical services, which 
would be the minimum coverage for all private health insurance plans and for a 
publicly funded benefits pool. 
</P>
<P>
Many workers would continue to get privately financed coverage as an employment 
benefit, with the employer paying most or all of the premium, and they could 
add to that coverage if they wanted. Also the federal Medicare insurance 
program for older and disabled Americans would continue. 
</P>
<P>
Everyone else would be covered by the pool called the Universal Access program. 
Medicaid, the federal health insurance program for the poor, would be abolished 
and its recipients would be covered by the new program. 
</P>
<P>
The Universal Access program would be financed by all employers and by all 
individuals not covered by Medicare who have incomes above 150% of the poverty 
level.
