Nelson Mandela deserves ageless respect for his 27 years of imprisonment on 
behalf of the anti-apartheid cause in South Africa. It is appropriate that this 
charismatic and widely acclaimed leader be welcomed and applauded as he tours 
the United States. 
</P>
<P>
Yet Americans should have good reason to be concerned about Mandela's political 
judgment, the potential nature of his leadership and the advice that he is 
offering during his visit. Heroism does not confer infallibility. Nor should 
suffering for a noble cause obscure the wrongness of positions that are 
diametrically opposed to basic values held by the people of our country. 
</P>
<P>
Mandela and his Marxist-oriented African National Congress have repeatedly 
supported and engaged in terrorism. Both before and since Mandela's release 
from prison, his organization has compiled a brutal record of violence against 
both black and white civilians in South Africa. 
</P>
<P>
Further, Mandela openly embraces notorious oppressors of human rights: 
Palestine Liberation Organization leader Yasser Arafat, Libyan dictator Moammar 
Kadafi and Cuban despot Fidel Castro. The reason for such embrace, Mandela 
tries to explain, is the long-standing support of the three for the ANC and its 
efforts to displace South Africa's ruling white regime. 
</P>
<P>
But that explanation is unsatisfactory. Expediency and the understandable need 
for support does not justify unholy alliance with those responsible for wanton 
murder and widespread violations of human rights. 
</P>
<P>
Mandela's gratuitous relationships with such enemies of peace and freedom 
naturally arouse fears among South Africa's whites, coloreds, Indians and 
minority black tribes. Such alliances raise questions about whether Mandela's 
professed desire for political justice is genuine and cause suspicions that 
make peaceful constitutional compromise with South Africa's racial and tribal 
minorities more difficult. 
</P>
<P>
Mandela's infatuation with "one-person, one-vote" sloganeering and his lack of 
accommodation for minority concerns is also antagonistic to the cause of 
political liberty in South Africa. Unchecked majoritarianism is a formula for 
tyranny over minorities. As James Madison explained: "In a society under the 
forms of which the stronger faction can readily unite and oppress the weaker, 
anarchy may as truly be said to reign as in a state of nature, where the weaker 
individual is not secured against the violence of the former." 
</P>
<P>
The founders of our Constitution went to great lengths to hold majoritarianism 
in check and to protect the rights of minorities. Hungary's newly revamped 
constitution offers special protections for Slovaks, Croats, Germans, 
Romanians, Serbs, Gypsies and Jews. Mandela's seeming indifference to similar 
protections against oppressive majority rule under new electoral conditions in 
South Africa suggests either unschooled political beliefs or nefarious 
political designs. 
</P>
<P>
Mandela's economic philosophy and his commitment to Marxist ideology also raise 
concerns. His sympathy for nationalizing South Africa's banks, mines and other 
industries in order to transfer wealth from the white minority to the black 
majority defies historical philosophical justification. Mandela cannot point to 
a single nationalization program in the entire African continent, including 
Egypt's Suez Canal and Kadafi's oil expropriations, that has set the framework 
for long-term prosperity. Indeed, such confiscation has typically yielded 
economic calamity, as illustrated by Mozambique. 
</P>
<P>
Nations throughout Eastern Europe and South America are privatizing their 
economies en mass to escape the disastrous results of government control. Why 
is Mandela holding out against the lessons and tide of economic history? Is it 
because he wishes to reward ANC loyalists with lucrative positions in 
government corporations at the expense of the commonweal? Is it because he 
wishes to silence dissent to the ANC by making millions dependent on an ANC 
paymaster? 
</P>
<P>
To raise questions of Mandela's political acumen and intent is not to detract 
from his courage and accomplishments in assailing apartheid. It is rather to 
alert the United States and the world community that heroic freedom fighters 
are often ill-equipped for the tasks of political statesmanship when the 
fighting ceases. 
</P>
<P>
John Brown displayed comparable courage and passion in fighting slavery in 
Kansas and at Harpers Ferry, yet was utterly unsuited for a role requiring 
political vision and magnanimity, a task that was ultimately accomplished by 
Abraham Lincoln. Mandela has yet to distinguish himself from John Brown.
