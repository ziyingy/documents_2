<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Section 1839(e) of the Act establishes the amount of the Medicare Part B premium at 50 percent of the monthly actuarial
rate for enrollees age 65 and over for months in calendar years 1984 through 1990; section 4301 of the Omnibus Budget
Reconciliation Act of 1990 added specific premiums for 1991 through 1995 based on Congressional Budget Office estimates,
at the time, of premium amounts that would equal 50 percent of that actuarial rate. Section 13571 of OBRA 93 amended
section 1839(e) of the Act to again have the premium determined annually so that it equals 50 percent of the monthly
actuarial rate for enrollees age 65 and over for calendar years 1996, 1997 and 1998.

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
To reflect OBRA 90 and 93 we are revising 42 CFR 408.20, Monthly premiums, by adding calendar years 1991 through 1995,
and calendar years after 1998, to the heading and content of paragraph (b), which currently contains the methodology
for the period July 1976 through December 1983 and the periods after 1990. We are specifying that the rates cited in
section 1839(e)(1)(B) of the Act apply to 1991 through 1995. To reflect OBRA 93, we are adding calendar years 1996 through
1998 to the heading and content of paragraph (c), which currently discusses the methodology for determining premiums
for calendar years 1984 through 1990.

XIII. Waiver of Proposed Rulemaking 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
We ordinarily publish a notice of proposed rulemaking for a regulation in the 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 -->
Federal Register
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 and provide a period for public comment. However, we may waive that procedure if we find good cause that prior notice
and comment are impracticable, unnecessary, or contrary to the public interest. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
As noted earlier, this rule updates our rules to properly reflect explicit statutory requirements that are clear
on their face and that we are not interpreting in any way beyond their commonly understood meanings. Without these
changes, certain regulation requirements are in conflict with the statute, possibly misleading those who rely on
our regulations. In addition, some of the statutory changes included in these regulations have been enacted with
retroactive effective dates or effective dates close to the date of enactment of OBRA 93. Under these circumstances,
prompt publication of the correct up-to-date rules best serves those governed by these regulations. Because this
rule does not create any legal requirements and because publishing a notice of proposed rulemaking here would perpetuate
conflicts between clear statutory directives and our regulations, we find that publishing a notice of proposed rulemaking
before issuing this final rule would be unnecessary and contrary to the public interest. However, we are providing
a 60-day comment period for public comments on the final rule as indicated at the beginning of this rule.

XIV. Response to Comments 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Because of the large number of items of correspondence we normally receive on FR documents published for comment,
we are not able to acknowledge or respond to them individually. We will consider all comments we receive by the date
and time specified in the 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=2 -->
DATES
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 section of this preamble, and, if we proceed with a subsequent document, we will respond to the comments in the preamble
to that document.

XV. Regulatory Impact Statement 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
We generally prepare a regulatory flexibility analysis that is consistent with the Regulatory Flexibility Act (RFA)
(5 U.S.C. 601 through 612) unless the Secretary certifies that a final rule will not have a significant economic impact
on a substantial number of small entities. For purposes of the RFA, all Medicare-participating facilities are considered
to be small entities. Individuals and States are not included in the definition of small entity. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Also, section 1102(b) of the Act requires the Secretary to prepare a regulatory impact analysis if a final rule will
have a significant impact on the operations of a substantial number of small rural hospitals. This analysis must conform
to the provisions of section 604 of the RFA. For purposes of section 1102(b) of the Act, we define a small rural hospital
as a hospital that is located outside of a Metropolitan Statistical Area and has fewer than 50 beds. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
This final rule with comment period updates our regulations to incorporate numerous self-implementing statutory
provisions that are not interrelated. None of the regulations interprets or extends requirements beyond those included
in the self-implementing legislation. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The amendments to which this rule pertains are already in effect or will go into effect independent of the publication
of this rule. Consequently, there are no actions to be taken that would flow from further analyses of the impact of these
provisions on entities. Therefore, we are not preparing analyses for either the RFA or section 1102(b) of the Act since
we have determined, and the Secretary certifies, that this proposed rule would not result in a significant economic
impact on a substantial number of small entities and would not have a significant economic impact on the operations
of a substantial number of small rural hospitals. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In accordance with the provisions of E.O. 12866, this final rule with comment period was not reviewed by the Office
of Management and Budget.

XVI. Collection of Information Requirements
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
This document does not impose information collection and recordkeeping requirements. Consequently, it need not
be reviewed by the Office of Management and Budget under the authority of the Paperwork Reduction Act of 1980 (44 U.S.C.
3501 et seq.).
