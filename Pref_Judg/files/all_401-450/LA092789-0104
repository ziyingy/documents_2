Central banks sold waves of dollars again Tuesday, but the results failed to 
measure up to Monday's successful intervention in currency markets. The dollar 
declined only slightly overall and actually rose against Japan's yen. 
</P>
<P>
The Group of Seven industrial democracies ganged up against the dollar after 
agreeing last weekend that the dollar's rise in recent months was "inconsistent 
with longer run economic fundamentals." 
</P>
<P>
Tuesday's intervention knocked only a fraction of a percent off the dollar's 
value, in contrast with Monday's decline of nearly six West German pfennigs and 
four Japanese yen. 
</P>
<P>
Some traders said the attractiveness of U.S. interest rates might bring 
investors back to dollar-denominated securities once the central bankers let 
up. 
</P>
<P>
In fact, the dollar ended the day above its lows of the session. 
</P>
<P>
"Maybe the dollar has taken it just a little bit on the chin but it has fought 
back quite nicely," said Victor Polce, vice president and manager of corporate 
foreign exchange at Algemene Bank Nederland NV in New York. 
</P>
<P>
Dealers agreed that most of the major government banks had sold dollars, but 
they disagreed on how large the sales were. 
</P>
<P>
Some of the dollar's drop against the West German mark came from continued 
speculation that the West German central bank would raise a key interest rate 
next month, drawing global investors away from dollars and into marks. 
</P>
<P>
In contrast, the dollar rose against the Japanese yen because fewer people 
expected the Bank of Japan to raise rates, dealers said. 
</P>
<P>
The Group of Seven consists of the United States, Japan, West Germany, France, 
Britain, Italy and Canada.
