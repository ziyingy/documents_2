I. Introduction
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
This document sets forth guidelines on the inclusion of women and members of minority groups and their subpopulations
in clinical research, including clinical trials, supported by the National Institutes of Health (NIH). For the purposes
of this document, clinical research is defined as NIH-supported biomedical and behavioral research involving human
subjects. These guidelines, implemented in accordance with section 492B of the Public Health Service Act, added
by the NIH Revitalization Act of 1993, Public Law. (Pub.L.) 103&hyph;43, supersede and strengthen the previous policies,
NIH/ADAMHA Policy Concerning the Inclusion of Women in Study Populations, and ADAMHA/NIH Policy Concerning the
Inclusion of Minorities in Study Populations, published in the NIH GUIDE FOR GRANTS AND CONTRACTS, 1990.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The 1993 guidelines continue the 1990 guidelines with three major additions. The new policy requires that, in addition
to the continuing inclusion of women and members of minority groups in all NIH-supported biomedical and behavioral
research involving human subjects, the NIH must:
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
&bull;Ensure that women and members of minorities and their subpopulations are included in all human subject research.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
&bull;For Phase III clinical trials, ensure that women and minorities and their subpopulations must be included
such that valid analyses of differences in intervention effect can be accomplished;
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
&bull;Not allow cost as an acceptable reason for excluding these groups; and,
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
&bull;Initiate programs and support for outreach efforts to recruit these groups into clinical studies.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Since a primary aim of research is to provide scientific evidence leading to a change in health policy or a standard
of care, it is imperative to determine whether the intervention or therapy being studied affects women or men or members
of minority groups and their subpopulations differently. To this end, the guidelines published here are intended
to ensure that all future NIH-supported biomedical and behavioral research involving human subjects will be carried
out in a manner sufficient to elicit information about individuals of both genders and the diverse racial and ethnic
groups and, in the case of clinical trials, to examine differential effects on such groups. Increased attention,
therefore, must be given to gender, race, and ethnicity in earlier stages of research to allow for informed decisions
at the Phase III clinical trial stage.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
These guidelines reaffirm NIH's commitment to the fundamental principles of inclusion of women and racial and ethnic
minority groups and their subpopulations in research. This policy should result in a variety of new research opportunities
to address significant gaps in knowledge about health problems that affect women and racial/ethnic minorities and
their subpopulations.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The NIH recognizes that issues will arise with the implementation of these guidelines and thus welcomes comments.
During the first year of implementation, NIH will review the comments, and consider modifications, within the scope
of the statute, to the guidelines.

II. Background
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The NIH Revitalization Act of 1993, PL 103&hyph;43, signed by President Clinton on June 10, 1993, directs the NIH to
establish guidelines for inclusion of women and minorities in clinical research. This guidance shall include guidelines
regarding_
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG QTAG 04 -->
<!-- PJG /QTAG -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->
(A) the circumstances under which the inclusion of women and minorities as subjects in projects of clinical research
is inappropriate *&blank;*&blank;*;
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(B) the manner in which clinical trials are required to be designed and carried out *&blank;*&blank;*; and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(C) the operation of outreach programs *&blank;*&blank;* 492B(d)(1)
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG QTAG 04 -->
<!-- PJG /QTAG -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The statute states that
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG QTAG 04 -->
<!-- PJG /QTAG -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->
In conducting or supporting clinical research for the purposes of this title, the Director of NIH shall *&blank;*&blank;*
ensure that_
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
A. women are included as subjects in each project of such research; and
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
B. members of minority groups are included in such research. 492B(a)(1)
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG QTAG 04 -->
<!-- PJG /QTAG -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The statute further defines ``clinical research'' to include ``clinical trials'' and states that
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG QTAG 04 -->
<!-- PJG /QTAG -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->
In the case of any clinical trial in which women or members of minority groups will be included as subjects, the Director
of NIH shall ensure that the trial is designed and carried out in a manner sufficient to provide for valid analysis of
whether the variables being studied in the trial affect women or members of minority groups, as the case may be, differently
than other subjects in the trial. 492B(C)
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG QTAG 04 -->
<!-- PJG /QTAG -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Specifically addressing the issue of minority groups, the statute states that
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG QTAG 04 -->
<!-- PJG /QTAG -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->
The term ``minority group'' includes subpopulations of minority groups. The Director of NIH shall, through the guidelines
established *&blank;*&blank;* defines the terms ``minority group'' and ``subpopulation'' for the purposes of
the preceding sentence. 492B(g)(2)
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG QTAG 04 -->
<!-- PJG /QTAG -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The statute speaks specifically to outreach and states that 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG QTAG 04 -->
<!-- PJG /QTAG -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->
The Director of NIH, in consultation with the Director of the Office of Research of Women's Health and the Director
of the Office of Research on Minority Health, shall conduct or support outreach programs for the recruitment of women
and members of minority groups as subjects in the projects of clinical research. 492B(a)(2)
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG QTAG 04 -->
<!-- PJG /QTAG -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The statute includes a specific provision pertaining to the cost of clinical research and, in particular clinical
trials.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG QTAG 04 -->
<!-- PJG /QTAG -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->
(A)(i) In the case of a clinical trial, the guidelines shall provide that the costs of such inclusion in the trial is
(sic) not a permissible consideration in determining whether such inclusion is inappropriate. 492B(d)(2)
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(ii) In the case of other projects of clinical research, the guidelines shall provide that the costs of such inclusion
in the project is (sic) not a permissible consideration in determining whether such inclusion is inappropriate unless
the data regarding women or members of minority groups, respectively, that would be obtained in such project (in the
event that such inclusion were required) have been or are being obtained through other means that provide data of comparable
quality. 492B(d)(2)
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG QTAG 04 -->
<!-- PJG /QTAG -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Exclusions to the requirement for inclusion of women and minorities are stated in the statute, as follows:
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG QTAG 04 -->
<!-- PJG /QTAG -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->
The requirements established regarding women and members of minority groups shall not apply to the project of clinical
research if the inclusion, as subjects in the project, of women and members of minority groups, respectively_
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(1) Is inappropriate with respect to the health of the subjects;
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(2) Is inappropriate with respect to the purpose of the research; or
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(3) Is inappropriate under such other circumstances as the Director of NIH may designate. 492B(b)
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(B) In the case of a clinical trial, the guidelines may provide that such inclusion in the trial is not required if there
is substantial scientific data demonstrating that there is no significant difference between_
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(i) The effects that the variables to be studied in the trial have on women or members of minority groups, respectively;
and
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(ii) The effects that variables have on the individuals who would serve as subjects in the trial in the event that such
inclusion were not required. 492B(d)(2)
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 -->
III. Policy
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 -->
A. Research Involving Human Subjects
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
It is the policy of NIH that women and members of minority groups and their subpopulations must be included in all NIH-supported
biomedical and behavioral research projects involving human subjects, unless a clear and compelling rationale
and justification establishes to the satisfaction of the relevant Institute/Center Director that inclusion is
inappropriate with respect to the health of the subjects or the purpose of the research. Exclusion under other circumstances
may be made by the Director, NIH, upon the recommendation of a Institute/Center Director based on a compelling rationale
and justification. Cost is not an acceptable reason for exclusion except when the study would duplicate data from
other sources. Women of childbearing potential should not be routinely excluded from participation in clinical
research. All NIH-supported biomedical and behavioral research involving human subjects is defined as clinical
research. This policy applies to research subjects of all ages.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The inclusion of women and members of minority groups and their subpopulations must be addressed in developing a research
design appropriate to the scientific objectives of the study. The research plan should describe the composition
of the proposed study population in terms of gender and racial/ethnic group, and provide a rationale for selection
of such subjects. Such a plan should contain a description of the proposed outreach programs for recruiting women
and minorities as participants.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 -->
B. Clinical Trials 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Under the statute, when a Phase III clinical trial (see Definitions, Section V&hyph;A) is proposed, evidence must
be reviewed to show whether or not clinically important gender or race/ethnicity differences in the intervention
effect are to be expected. This evidence may include, but is not limited to, data derived from prior animal studies,
clinical observations, metabolic studies, genetic studies, pharmacology studies, and observational, natural
history, epidemiology and other relevant studies.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
As such, investigators must consider the following when planning a Phase III clinical trial for NIH support.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
&bull;If the data from prior studies strongly indicate the existence of significant differences of clinical or public
health importance in intervention effect among subgroups (gender and/or racial/ethnic subgroups), the primary
question(s) to be addressed by the proposed Phase III trial and the design of that trial must specifically accommodate
this. For example, if men and women are thought to respond differently to an intervention, then the Phase III trial
must be designed to answer two separate primary questions, one for men and the other for women, with adequate sample
size for each.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
&bull;If the data from prior studies strongly support no significant differences of clinical or public health importance
in intervention effect between subgroups, then gender or race/ethnicity will not be required as subject selection
criteria. However, the inclusion of gender or racial/ethnic subgroups is still strongly encouraged. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
&bull;If the data from prior studies neither support strongly nor negate strongly the existence of significant differences
of clinical or public health importance in intervention effect between subgroups, then the Phase III trial will be
required to include sufficient and appropriate entry of gender and racial/ethnic subgroups, so that valid analysis
of the intervention effect in subgroups can be performed. However, the trial will not be required to provide high statistical
power for each subgroup. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Cost is not an acceptable reason for exclusion of women and minorities from clinical trials. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 -->
C. Funding
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
NIH funding components will not award any grant, cooperative agreement or contract or support any intramural project
to be conducted or funded in Fiscal Year 1995 and thereafter which does not comply with this policy. For research awards
that are covered by this policy, awardees will report annually on enrollment of women and men, and on the race and ethnicity
of research participants. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 -->
IV. Implementation
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 -->
A. Date of Implementation
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
This policy applies to all applications/proposals and intramural projects to be submitted on and after June 1, 1994
(the date of full implementation) seeking Fiscal Year 1995 support. Projects funded prior to June 10, 1993, must still
comply with the 1990 policy and report annually on enrollment of subjects using gender and racial/ethnic categories
as required in the Application for Continuation of a Public Health Service Grant (PHS Form 2590), in contracts and
in intramural projects.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 -->
B. Transition Policy
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
NIH-supported biomedical and behavioral research projects involving human subjects, with the exception of Phase
III clinical trial projects as discussed below, that are awarded between June 10, 1993, the date of enactment, and
September 30, 1994, the end of Fiscal Year 1994, shall be subject to the requirements of the 1990 policy and the annual
reporting requirements on enrollment using gender and racial/ethnic categories. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
For all Phase III clinical trial projects proposed between June 10, 1993 and June 1, 1994, and those awarded between
June 10, 1993 and September 30, 1994, Institute/Center staff will examine the applications/proposals, pending
awards, awards and intramural projects to determine if the study was developed in a manner consistent with the new
guidelines. If it is deemed inconsistent, NIH staff will contact investigators to discuss approaches to accommodate
the new policy. Administrative actions may be needed to accommodate or revise the pending trials. Institutes/Centers
may need to consider initiating a complementary activity to address any gender or minority representation concerns.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The NIH Director will determine whether the Phase III clinical trial being considered during this transition is in
compliance with this policy, whether acceptable modifications have been made, or whether the Institute/Center
will initiate a complementary activity that addresses the gender or minority representation concerns. Pending
awards will not be funded without this determination.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Solicitations issued by the NIH planned for release after the date of publication of the guidelines in the 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 -->
Federal Register
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 will include the new requirements.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 -->
C. Roles and Responsibilities
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
While this policy applies to all applicants for NIH-supported biomedical and behavioral research involving human
subjects, certain individuals and groups have special roles and responsibilities with regard to the adoption and
implementation of these guidelines.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The NIH staff will provide educational opportunities for the extramural and intramural community concerning this
policy; monitor its implementation during the development, review, award and conduct of research; and manage the
NIH research portfolio to address the policy.

Principal investigators should assess the theoretical and/or scientific linkages between gender, race/ethnicity,
and their topic of study. Following this assessment, the principal investigator and the applicant institution will
address the policy in each application and proposal, providing the required information on inclusion of women and
minorities and their subpopulations in research projects, and any required justifications for exceptions to the
policy. Depending on the purpose of the study, NIH recognizes that a single study may not include all minority groups.

As the IRBs implement the guidelines, described herein, for the inclusion of women and minorities and their subpopulations,
they must also implement the regulations for the protection of human subjects as described in title 45 CFR part 46,
``Protection of Human Subjects.'' They should take into account the Food and Drug Administration's ``Guidelines

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
In conducting peer review for scientific and technical merit, appropriately constituted initial review groups
(including study sections), technical evaluation groups, and intramural review panels will be instructed, as follows:
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
&bull;To evaluate the proposed plan for the inclusion of minorities and both genders for appropriate representation
or to evaluate the proposed justification when representation is limited or absent, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
&bull;To evaluate the proposed exclusion of minorities and women on the basis that a requirement for inclusion is
inappropriate with respect to the health of the subjects, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
&bull;To evaluate the proposed exclusion of minorities and women on the basis that a requirement for inclusion is
inappropriate with respect to the purpose of the research,
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
&bull;To determine whether the design of clinical trials is adequate to measure differences when warranted,
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
&bull;To evaluate the plans for recruitment/outreach for study, participants, and
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
&bull;To include these criteria as part of the scientific assessment and assigned score.

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
In addition to its current responsibilities for review of projects where the peer review groups have raised questions
about the appropriate inclusion of women and minorities, the Advisory Council/Board of each Institute/Center shall
prepare biennial reports, for inclusion in the overall NIH Director's biennial report, describing the manner in
which the Institute/Center has complied with the provisions of the statute.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

5. Institute/Center Directors
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Institute/Center Directors and their staff shall determine whether: (a) The research involving human subjects,
(b) the Phase III clinical trials, and (c) the exclusions meet the requirements of the statute and these guidelines.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The NIH Director may approve, on a case-by-case basis, the exclusion of projects, as recommended by the Institute/Center
Director, that may be inappropriate to include within the requirements of these guidelines on the basis of circumstances
other than the health of the subjects, the purpose of the research, or costs.

7. Recruitment Outreach by Extramural and Intramural Investigators
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Investigators and their staff(s) are urged to develop appropriate and culturally sensitive outreach programs and
activities commensurate with the goals of the study. The objective should be to actively recruit the most diverse
study population consistent with the purposes of the research project. Indeed, the purpose should be to establish
a relationship between the investigator(s) and staff(s) and populations and community(ies) of interest such that
mutual benefit is derived for participants in the study. Investigator(s) and staff(s) should take precautionary
measures to ensure that ethical concerns are clearly noted, such that there is minimal possibility of coercion or
undue influence in the incentives or rewards offered in recruiting into or retaining participants in studies. It
is also the responsibility of the IRBs to address these ethical concerns.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Furthermore, while the statute focuses on recruitment outreach, NIH staff underscore the need to appropriately
retain participants in clinical studies, and thus, the outreach programs and activities should address both recruitment
and retention.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
To assist investigators and potential study participants, NIH staff have prepared a notebook, ``NIH Outreach Notebook
On the Inclusion of Women and Minorities in Biomedical and Behavioral Research.'' The notebook addresses both recruitment
and retention of women and minorities in clinical studies, provides relevant references and case studies, and discusses
ethical issues. It is not intended as a definitive text on this subject, but should assist investigators in their consideration
of an appropriate plan for recruiting and retaining participants in clinical studies. The notebook is expected to
be available early in 1994.

9. Applicability to Foreign Research Involving Human Subjects
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
For foreign awards, the NIH policy on inclusion of women in research conducted outside the U.S. is the same as that for
research conducted in the U.S.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
However, with regard to the population of the foreign country, the definition of the minority groups may be different
than in the U.S. If there is scientific rationale for examining subpopulation group differences within the foreign
population, investigators should consider designing their studies to accommodate these differences.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 -->
V. Definitions
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Throughout the section of the statute pertaining to the inclusion of women and minorities, terms are used which require
definition for the purpose of implementing these guidelines. These terms, drawn directly from the statute, are defined
below.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 -->
A. Clinical Trial
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
For the purpose of these guidelines, a ``clinical trial'' is a broadly based prospective Phase III clinical investigation,
usually involving several hundred or more human subjects, for the purpose of evaluating an experimental intervention
in comparison with a standard or control intervention or comparing two or more existing treatments. Often the aim
of such investigation is to provide evidence leading to a scientific basis for consideration of a change in health
policy or standard of care. The definition includes pharmacologic, non-pharmacologic, and behavioral interventions
given for disease prevention, prophylaxis, diagnosis, or therapy. Community trials and other population-based
intervention trials are also included.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 -->
B. Research Involving Human Subjects
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
All NIH-supported biomedical and behavioral research involving human subjects is defined as clinical research
under this policy. Under this policy, the definition of human subjects in title 45 CFR part 46, the Department of Health
and Human Services regulations for the protection of human subjects applies: ``Human subject means a living individual
about whom an investigator (whether professional or student) conducting research obtains: (1) Data through intervention
or interaction with the individual, or (2) identifiable private information.'' These regulations specifically
address the protection of human subjects from research risks. It should be noted that there are research areas (Exemptions
1&hyph;6) that are exempt from these regulations. However, under these guidelines, NIH-supported biomedical and
behavioral research projects involving human subjects which are exempt from the human subjects regulations should
still address the inclusion of women and minorities in their study design. Therefore, all biomedical and behavioral
research projects involving human subjects will be evaluated for compliance with this policy. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 -->
C. Valid Analysis
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The term ``valid analysis'' means an unbiased assessment. Such an assessment will, on average, yield the correct
estimate of the difference in outcomes between two groups of subjects. Valid analysis can and should be conducted
for both small and large studies. A valid analysis does not need to have a high statistical power for detecting a stated
effect. The principal requirements for ensuring a valid analysis of the question of interest are:
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
&bull;Allocation of study participants of both genders and from different racial/ethnic groups to the intervention
and control groups by an unbiased process such as randomization,
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
&bull;Unbiased evaluation of the outcome(s) of study participants, and
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
&bull;Use of unbiased statistical analyses and proper methods of inference to estimate and compare the intervention
effects among the gender and racial/ethnic groups.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 -->
D. Significant Difference
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
For purposes of this policy, a ``significant difference'' is a difference that is of clinical or public health importance,
based on substantial scientific data. This definition differs from the commonly used ``statistically significant
difference,'' which refers to the event that, for a given set of data, the statistical test for a difference between
the effects in two groups achieves statistical significance. Statistical significance depends upon the amount
of information in the data set. With a very large amount of information, one could find a statistically significant,
but clinically small difference that is of very little clinical importance. Conversely, with less information one
could find a large difference of potential importance that is not statistically significant.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 -->
E. Racial and Ethnic Categories
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=81 g=1 f=1 -->
1. Minority Groups
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
A minority group is a readily identifiable subset of the U.S. population which is distinguished by either racial,
ethnic, and/or cultural heritage.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Office of Management and Budget (OMB) Directive No. 15 defines the minimum standard of basic racial and ethnic
categories, which are used below. NIH has chosen to continue the use of these definitions because they allow comparisons
to many national data bases, especially national health data bases. Therefore, the racial and ethnic categories
described below should be used as basic guidance, cognizant of the distinction based on cultural heritage.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
American Indian or Alaskan Native:
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 A person having origins in any of the original peoples of North America, and who maintains cultural identification
through tribal affiliation or community recognition.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Asian or Pacific Islander:
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 A person having origins in any of the original peoples of the Far East, Southeast Asia, the Indian subcontinent, or
the Pacific Islands. This area includes, for example, China, India, Japan, Korea, the Philippine Islands and Samoa.

White, not of Hispanic Origin:
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 A person having origins in any of the original peoples of Europe, North Africa, or the Middle East.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
NIH recognizes the diversity of the U.S. population and that changing demographics are reflected in the changing
racial and ethnic composition of the population. The terms ``minority groups'' and ``minority subpopulations''
are meant to be inclusive, rather than exclusive, of differing racial and ethnic categories.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=81 g=1 f=1 -->
3. Subpopulations
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Each minority group contains subpopulations which are delimited by geographic origins, national origins and/or
cultural differences. It is recognized that there are different ways of defining and reporting racial and ethnic
subpopulation data. The subpopulation to which an individual is assigned depends on self-reporting of specific
racial and ethnic origin. Attention to subpopulations also applies to individuals of mixed racial and/or ethnic
parentage. Researchers should be cognizant of the possibility that these racial/ethnic combinations may have biomedical
and/or cultural implications related to the scientific question under study.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 -->
F. Outreach Strategies
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
These are outreach efforts by investigators and their staff(s) to appropriately recruit and retain populations
of interest into research studies. Such efforts should represent a thoughtful and culturally sensitive plan of outreach
and generally include involvement of other individuals and organizations relevant to the populations and communities
of interest, e.g., family, religious organizations, community leaders and informal gatekeepers, and public and
private institutions and organizations. The objective is to establish appropriate lines of communication and cooperation
to build mutual trust and cooperation such that both the study and the participants benefit from such collaboration.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 -->
G. Research Portfolio
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Each Institute and Center at the NIH has its own research portfolio, i.e., its ``holdings'' in research grants, cooperative
agreements, contracts and intramural studies. The Institute or Center evaluates the research awards in its portfolio
to identify those areas where there are knowledge gaps or which need special attention to advance the science involved.
NIH may consider funding projects to achieve a research portfolio reflecting diverse study populations. With the
implementation of this new policy, there will be a need to ensure that sufficient resources are provided within a program
to allow for data to be developed for a smooth transition from basic research to Phase III clinical trials that meet
the policy requirements.

VI. Discussion_Issues in Scientific Plans and Study Designs
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 -->
A. Issues in Research Involving Human Subjects
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The biomedical and behavioral research process can be viewed as a stepwise process progressing from discovery of
new knowledge through research in the laboratory, research involving animals, research involving human subjects,
validation of interventions through clinical trials, and broad application to improve the health of the public.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
All NIH-supported biomedical and behavioral research involving human subjects is defined broadly in this guidance
as clinical research. This is broader than the definition provided in the 1990 NIH Guidance and in many program announcements,
requests for applications, and requests for proposals since 1990.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The definition was broadened because of the need to obtain data about minorities and both genders early in the research
process when hypotheses are being formulated, baseline data are being collected, and various measurement instruments
and intervention strategies are being developed. Broad inclusion at these early stages of research provides valuable
information for designing broadly based clinical trials, which are a subset of studies under the broad category of
research studies.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The policy on inclusion of minorities and both genders applies to all NIH-supported biomedical and behavioral research
involving human subjects so that the maximum information may be obtained to understand the implications of the research
findings on the gender or minority group.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Investigators should consider the types of information concerning gender and minority groups which will be required
when designing future Phase III clinical trials, and try to obtain it in their earlier stages of research involving
human subjects. NIH recognizes that the understanding of health problems and conditions of different U.S. populations
may require attention to socioeconomic differences involving occupation, education, and income gradients.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 -->
B. Issues in Clinical Trials
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The statute requires appropriate representation of subjects of different gender and race/ethnicity in clinical
trials so as to provide the opportunity for detecting major qualitative differences (if they exist) among gender
and racial/ethnic subgroups and to identify more subtle differences that might, if warranted, be explored in further
specifically targeted studies. Other interpretations may not serve as well the health needs of women, minorities,
and all other constituencies.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Preparatory to any Phase III clinical trial, certain data are typically obtained. Such data are necessary for the
design of an appropriate Phase III trial and include observational clinical study data, basic laboratory (i.e. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
in vitro
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 and animal) data, and clinical, physiologic, pharmacokinetic, or biochemical data from Phase I and Phase II studies.
Genetic studies, behavioral studies, and observational, natural history, and epidemiological studies may also
contribute data.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
It is essential that data be reviewed from prior studies on a diverse population, that is, in subjects of both genders
and from different racial/ethnic groups. These data must be examined to determine if there are significant differences
of clinical or public health importance observed between the subgroups.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
While data from prior studies relating to possible differences among intervention effects in different subgroups
must be reviewed, evidence of this nature is likely to be less convincing than that deriving from the subgroup analyses
that can be performed in usual-sized Phase III trials. This is because the evidence from preliminary studies is likely
to be of a more indirect nature (e.g. based on surrogate endpoints), deriving from uncontrolled studies (e.g. non-randomized
Phase II trials), and based on smaller numbers of subjects than in Phase III secondary analyses. For this reason, it
is likely that data from preliminary studies will, in the majority of cases, neither clearly reveal significant differences
of clinical or public health importance between subgroups of patients, nor strongly negate them.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In these cases, Phase III trials should still have appropriate gender and racial/ethnic representation, but they
would not need to have the large sample sizes necessary to provide a high statistical power for detecting differences
in intervention effects among subgroups. Nevertheless, analyses of subgroup effects must be conducted and comparisons
between the subgroups must be made. Depending on the results of these analyses, the results of other relevant research,
and the results of meta-analyses of clinical trials, one might initiate subsequent trials to examine more fully these
subgroup differences.

C. Issues Concerning Appropriate Gender Representation
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The ``population at risk'' may refer to only one gender where the disease, disorders, or conditions are gender specific.
In all other cases, there should be approximately equal numbers of both sexes in studies of populations or sub-populations
at risk, unless different proportions are appropriate because of the known prevalance, incidence, morbidity, mortality
rates, or expected intervention effect.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 -->
D. Issues Concerning Appropriate Representation of Minority Groups and Subpopulations in All Research Involving
Human Subjects Including Phase III Clinical Trials
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
While the inclusion of minority subpopulations in research is a complex and challenging issue, it nonetheless provides
the opportunity for researchers to collect data on subpopulations where knowledge gaps exist. Researchers must
consider the inclusion of subpopulations in all stages of research design. In meeting this objective, they should
be aware of concurrent research that addresses specific subpopulations, and consider potential collaborations
which may result in complementary subpopulation data.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
At the present time, there are gaps in baseline and other types of data necessary for research involving certain minority
groups and/or subpopulations of minority groups. In these areas, it would be appropriate for researchers to obtain
such data, including baseline data, by studying a single minority group.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
It would also be appropriate for researchers to test survey instruments, recruitment procedures, and other methodologies
used in the majority or other population(s) with the objective of assessing their feasibility, applicability, and
cultural competence/relevance to a particular minority group or subpopulation. This testing may provide data on
the validity of the methodologies across groups. Likewise, if an intervention has been tried in the majority population
and not in certain minority groups, it would be appropriate to assess the intervention effect on a single minority
group and compare the effect to that obtained in the majority population. These types of studies will advance scientific
research and assist in closing knowledge gaps.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
A complex issue arises over how broad or narrow the division into different subgroups should be, given the purpose
of the research. Division into many racial/ethnic subgroups is tempting in view of the cultural and biological differences
that exist among these groups and the possibility that some of these differences may in fact impact in some way upon
the scientific question. Alternatively, from a practical perspective, a limit has to be placed on the number of such
subgroups that can realistically be studied in detail for each intervention that is researched. The investigator
should clearly address the rationale for inclusion or exclusion of subgroups in terms of the purpose of the research.
Emphasis should be placed upon inclusion of subpopulations in which the disease manifests itself or the intervention
operates in an appreciable different way. Investigators should report the subpopulations included in the study.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
An important issue is the appropriate representation of minority groups in research, especially in geographical
locations which may have limited numbers of racial/ethnic population groups available for study. The investigator
must address this issue in terms of the purpose of the research, and other factors, such as the size of the study, relevant
characteristics of the disease, disorder or condition, and the feasibility of making a collaboration or consortium
or other arrangements to include minority groups. A justification is required if there is limited representation.
Peer reviewers and NIH staff will consider the justification in their evaluations of the project.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
NIH interprets the statute in a manner that leads to feasible and real improvements in the representativeness of different
racial/ethnic groups in research and places emphasis on research in those subpopulations that are disproportionately
affected by certain diseases or disorders.
