The art of the metaphor is flourishing in South Africa - a country not known
for flights of linguistic fancy.
Thus a few months ago an ANC-aligned group of economists and academics
produced a set of economic analogies which took inspiration from the zoo.
South Africa, it said, faced four scenario options: ostrich, lame duck,
Icarus, and flamingo. These amount to: still keeping heads in the sand;
failing to fly because of structural defects; soaring towards prosperity,
but collapsing in a heap of populist inflation; and flying off serenely into
a glowing sunset.
Now, Nico Cyzpionka, group economist with the Standard Bank group, has
sought refuge in the sea, with apologies to Shakespeare. He says South
Africa has three options: A Midsummer Night's Dream, with 'fair weather,
favourable tides and a sound ship'; All's Well that Ends Well, where 'those
at the helm sail the ship into calmer waters'; and 'The Tempest' where the
wrong course sinks the ship.
