A KENYAN former vice-president, Mr Jaramogi Oginga Odinga, convened a
congress of the country's divided opposition movement FORD yesterday and was
chosen as presidential candidate in a vote boycotted by party rivals, Reuter
reports from Nairobi.
The meeting widened a split along tribal lines among opponents of President
Daniel arap Moi, in power for 13 years. He has promised Kenya its first
multi-party election for 26 years. The opposition chances turn partly on
whether FORD (Forum for the Restoration of Democracy) can campaign as a
cross-tribal alliance.
