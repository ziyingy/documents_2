1. OBRA '90 Changes

Section 4603(a) of OBRA '90 changed the requirements in section 1902(e)(4) of the Act under which a newborn child remains
eligible for Medicaid, effective January 1, 1991. Prior to this change, States were only required to continue the
eligibility of an infant deemed eligible at birth for so long as the infant remained a member of the mother's household
and the mother remained eligible for Medicaid. States must now also continue the eligibility of an infant deemed eligible
at birth if the infant remains a member of the mother's household and the mother loses Medicaid eligibility but would
remain eligible if pregnant.

We considered whether the language ``remain eligible if pregnant'' meant that the mother should be considered as
newly pregnant in each month after the postpartum period. Under this interpretation, if the mother was regarded as
reapplying for Medicaid after the postpartum period as though she were newly pregnant, her income might be too high
for her to be eligible, even under the pregnancy-related eligibility categories. (For example, the mother's income
may have increased above the applicable standard during the pregnancy but she remained eligible through the postpartum
period by virtue of section 1902(e)(6) of the Act.) If she is regarded as newly pregnant, she would not receive the continued
coverage under section 1902(e)(6) for women whose incomes increase after they are already eligible and pregnant.
As a result, the mother would not be ``eligible'' even if she were considered to be pregnant and the infant would lose
eligibility under section 1902(e)(4).

We decided that a better reading of the provision would be to consider a mother as if she had not yet given birth; that
is, as if she had remained continuously pregnant. A discussion of this provision in the House Report of the Committee
on Budget to accompany H.R. 5835 (H. Rep. No. 881, 101st Cong., 2d. Sess. 103 (1990)) refers to the woman remaining eligible
for Medicaid or one who ``would be eligible for Medicaid were she still pregnant,'' which implies she should be treated
as if she had not given birth. Therefore, we propose to require States to continue the eligibility of an infant deemed
eligible at birth who is in his or her mother's household and whose mother would still be eligible for Medicaid if the
infant had not yet been born. Under this interpretation, changes in the mother's income will have no impact on the infant's
eligibility because were the mother still pregnant, she would remain eligible without regard to changes in income
by virtue of section 1902(e)(6) of the Act. A redetermination of the mother's eligibility is not required at the end
of the postpartum period unless information is received that there has been a change in the mother's circumstances
which might have affected her eligibility even if she were still pregnant and the infant had not yet been born.

2. Member of the Mother's Household

An infant must continue to be a member of his/her mother's household to maintain deemed newborn eligibility. We are
codifying existing policy related to determinations of whether an infant is a member of his or her mother's household.
An infant is considered a member of his or her mother's household as long as he or she is continuously hospitalized after
birth, unless the mother has legally relinquished control of the child or the State has established that she has abandoned
the child. After the infant's release from the hospital, or in situations not involving hospitalization, States
must apply the AFDC rules for determining whether a child is living with a specified relative to determine if an infant
(who is not an SSI recipient) is a member of his or her mother's household.

E. Inpatient Services to Infants and Children 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Under section 1902(e)(7) of the Act, as added by OBRA '86 and amended by section 4101(b) of OBRA '87, section 302(e)(2)
of MCCA, and section 6401 of OBRA '89, States must extend Medicaid eligibility to a low-income infant or child described
in section 1902(l) of the Act or a qualified child described in section 1905(n)(2) of the Act who is receiving covered
inpatient services in a hospital or a long-term care facility on the date he or she attains the maximum age for Medicaid
eligibility under the State plan until the end of the inpatient stay if the child or infant remains eligible, except
that he or she has attained that maximum age. This provision applies to the mandatory and optional categorically needy
eligibility groups of low-income infants and children described under section 1902(l) of the Act. Section 6401 of
OBRA '89 extended this provision to the new mandatory categorically needy group of low-income children age 1 up to
age 6 under section 1902(l)(1)(C) and section 4601 of OBRA '90 (by changes to section 1902(l)(1)(D)) to the new mandatory
categorically needy group of children born after September 30, 1983 who have not attained age 19 also. (In addition,
section 302(b) of MCCA further clarified this provision by adding in the matter after paragraph (F) of section 1902(a)(10)
a new paragraph (X) to provide that States that impose durational limits on payments for inpatient hospital services
must establish exceptions to these limits for medically necessary inpatient services received by an infant up to
age 1 in a hospital designated as a disproportionate share hospital under the State's Medicaid plan. Regulations
to interpret section 302(b) of MCCA are included in a separate document that is under development.)
