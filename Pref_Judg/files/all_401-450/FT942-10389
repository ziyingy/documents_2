The deregulated gas industry should be able to subsidise as many as 2.4m
households which consume small amounts of gas if it is politically desirable
to do so, Alliance Gas, one of the largest of the new independent gas
marketers, said yesterday.
Mr Kris Maroe, managing director of Alliance, which is owned by British
Petroleum and Statoil of Norway, said fears that many consumers might face
price rises during the move to an open market should not be an obstacle to
introducing competition.
Its calculations showed that by 1996, when competition is to be phased in,
no more than 2.4m households out of a total of about 18m would be
unprofitable for gas companies to serve. The category covered households
which used less than 200 therms of gas a year, and which included many
consumers who used gas only for cooking.
Mr Maroe said the volume required to supply them amounted to only 1.6 per
cent of gas consumed. He added: 'If it is politically desirable then we in
the industry should be able to afford a cross-subsidy amounting to only 1.6
per cent of the market.'
He was confident that such a cross-subsidy would not alter the level playing
field for a deregulated gas industry which the government is trying to
create.
Opposition MPs and some consumer groups have said that up to 6m households
could face increased gas prices when cross-subsidies are removed.
