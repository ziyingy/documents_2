THE WORLD'S largest cruise liner could be plying the seas within four years
following an agreement yesterday on a contract estimated to be worth more
than Dollars 400m (Pounds 263m) between Fincantieri, the Italian state-owned
shipbuilding group, and Carnival Cruises of the US.
The new vessel, to be built by Fincantieri at its Monfalcone yard near
Trieste, will weigh around 95,000 gross registered tons. That is over 20,000
tons more than the Sovereign of the Seas, the world's biggest cruise liner,
operated by Royal Caribbean Cruises.
With 1,300 cabins and space for around 4,400 passengers, the new vessel will
also be the most expensive of its kind and could open an era of new 'jumbo'
luxury passenger liners.
The contract confirms Fincantieri's position among leading cruise ship
builders. Though still heavily loss-making, the company has since the
mid-1980s exploited a growing demand for large luxury liners, principally in
the US, to develop an important new line of business. In spite of being
saddled with some warships built for Iraq, it now claims to be trading
profitably.
The yard is building three 55,000 ton sister ships for Holland America Line,
an affiliate of Carnival Cruises.
The new vessel, as yet unnamed, will be powered by six massive GMT-Sulzer
diesel electric engines, which will provide 'the most powerful propulsion
package for a vessel of its kind,' according to a Fincantieri official. In
spite of its size, the 'per berth' price of the new ship will be competitive
with other vessels being built for Carnival, he said.
Carnival Cruises, which is listed on the New York Stock Exchange, is the
world's largest cruise line in terms of passengers carried. It operates 18
ships, mainly in the Caribbean and Alaska, and has tried to break away from
the staid image of cruise holidays with entertainment-oriented vessels with
names such as Sensation and Fantasy.
