The same destructive process that opened a hole in the Earth's protective ozone 
layer over Antarctica is operating in the Arctic, the head of Canada's ozone 
research team said. Dr. Wayne Evans said there was a "crater" of ozone 
depletion over Scandinavia during the first week of February. The result of a 
thinner ozone layer is increased penetration of the sun's ultraviolet 
radiation, leading to increased skin cancer, eye damage and damage to crops. 
The Canadian research team, operating in the Northwest Territories, discovered 
some ozone depletion in the Arctic in 1986. The ozone problem first gained wide 
attention in 1985 when British scientists discovered a 40% loss in springtime 
ozone levels centered over Antarctica.
