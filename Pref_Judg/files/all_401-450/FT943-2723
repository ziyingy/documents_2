A mixed performance in the European morning turned into a painful erosion of
equity values yesterday afternoon, writes Our Markets Staff.
Domestic bond markets took severe punishment as US data showed industrial
production and capacity utilisation at levels higher than expected.
PARIS took the full force of the European selling wave. Having enjoyed a
moderately good morning, after a strong overnight rise in the Dow, the CAC
fell away sharply throughout the afternoon.
Almost mirroring last Friday's performance, when the 40 share index closed
down 2.2 per cent, the market ended the day with a loss of 2.6 per cent,
down 52.71 at 1,924.59, bringing its accumulated loss on the week to 1.2 per
cent.
Turnover was FFr3.8bn.
One or two bright spots were in evidence. St Gobain, for instance, picked up
FFr13 to FFr655 following its greatly improved first half results, which
exceeded analysts' expectations.
Total, initially, was another gainer, rising to an intraday high of FFr338
before succumbing to the afternoon sell-off and closing the session down a
modest 60 centimes at FFr331.60. The oil group, which rose 4 per cent on
Thursday, has been benefiting from renewed overseas interest.
FRANKFURT was pulled well off its highs during the official session by weak
bonds, and it lost more ground in the post bourse as the December bund
future hita contract low, and then fell further.
The Dax index registered an early high of 2,138.65 but closed the session at
2,118.73, up 4.75 on the day and down 3 per cent on the week. After hours,
it slid to 2,097.45, a fraction above its worst for the day.
There were encouraging moves on the session. Veba closed up DM4.10 at
DM541.50 on plans for a stake in the satellite telecommunications company,
Iridium; and Preussag rose DM4 to DM459.50 after it said it was buying from
Metallgesellschaft a 65 per cent stake in the transport group, LMT.
Metallgesellschaft hit a new 1994 low of DM167.20 before closing DM6 lower
at DM169, and defying the post-bourse slump with a token recovery to DM171
in the afternoon.
MILAN received a boost from news of Montedison's return to first half
pre-tax profit, before the US news raised worries about higher inflation and
interest rates. The Comit index put on 17.15 or 2.6 per cent to 678.49 for a
2.4 per cent rise over the week.
Mr Michele Pacitti at James Capel said that renewed buying was being seen in
anticipation of positive news from forthcoming half year corporate reports.
Montedison climbed L44 or 3.2 per cent to L1,423, after a high of L1,452,
while Ferruzzi, the parent company, put on L68 to L1,637. The mood spilled
over to other industrials, taking Fiat L90 ahead to L6,574.
Insurers continued to do well on hopes that they will benefit from pension
reform. Generali rose L825 or 2.1 per cent to L39,310 as it launched its
one-for-10 rights issue.
Against the trend, Olivetti gave up L20 to L2,060 ahead of first half
operating results next Thursday which, some analysts have forecast, could
include losses on its bond portfolio of at least L1bn.
ZURICH came under pressure from lower US bonds and the weaker dollar, and
the SMI index fell 25.3 to 2,603.3, down 1.5 per cent on the week.
Roche certificates, under pressure on Thursday after Goldman Sachs removed
them from its European recommended for purchase list, fell another SFr90 to
SFr5,960, in spite of news that BZW had confirmed its 'strong buy'
recommendation yesterday.
Nestle fell SFr16 to SFr1,200 in response to Thursday's smaller than
expected first half profit rise, although analysts remained optimistic for
the full year result.
AMSTERDAM breached the 410 support level as the repercussions of US data
made themselves felt and the AEX index declined 4.03 to 407.58. After a
see-saw week's trading the index closed a net 1.3 per cent lower, with
options expiry also adding to the day's gloom.
Brokers reported that the next support level was at 405.
MADRID's focus on bond markets took banks lower again, the sector leading
the way down with construction and building materials stocks as the general
index fell 3.23 to 301.21, 1.3 per cent down on the week.
In construction, FCC, Huarte and Uralita dropped Pta530 to Pta12,360, Pta60
to Pta1,580 and Pta50 to Pta1,535 respectively. In banks, up on Thursday on
rumours of more relaxed rules on provisions for bond market losses,
Argentaria lost Pta150 at Pta5,310 and BBV Pta80 at Pta3,145. Ironically,
the Bank of Spain was reported to be moving on the provisioning initiative
after the market closed.
