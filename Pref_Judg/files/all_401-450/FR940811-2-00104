Situation: 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Alpha, a manufacturer of farm equipment, develops a new emission control technology for its tractor engines and licenses
it to Beta, another farm equipment manufacturer. Alpha's emission control technology is far superior to the technology
currently owned and used by Beta, so much so that Beta's technology does not discipline the prices that Alpha could
charge for its technology. Beta has no likelihood of developing an improved emissions control technology on its own.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 Alpha's and Beta's emission control technologies are not economic substitutes for each other. Beta is a consumer
of Alpha's technology and is not an actual or likely potential competitor of Alpha in the relevant market for technologically
superior emission control devices of the kind licensed by Alpha. This means that the relationship between Alpha and
Beta with regard to the supply and use of emissions control technology is vertical. Assuming that Alpha and Beta sell
farm equipment products that are economic substitutes for each other, their relationship is horizontal in the relevant
markets for farm equipment.

Situation:

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Beta develops a new value technology for its engines and enters into a cross-licensing arrangement with Alpha, whereby
Alpha licenses its emission control technology to Beta and Beta licenses its valve technology to Alpha. Alpha already
owns an alternative valve technology that is an economic substitute for Beta's valve technology. Before adopting
Beta's technology, Alpha was using its own valve technology in its production of engines and was licensing (and continues
to license) that technology for use by others. As in Example 3, Beta does not own or control an emission control technology
that is an economic substitute for the technology licensed from Alpha.

Beta is a consumer and not a competitor of Alpha's emission control technology. As in Example 3, their relationship
is vertical with regard to this technology. The relationship between Alpha and Beta in the relevant market that includes
engine valve technology is vertical in part and horizontal in part. It is vertical in part because Alpha and Beta stand
in a complementary relationship, in which Alpha is a consumer of a technology supplied by Beta. However, the relationship
between Alpha and Beta in the relevant market that includes engine valve technology is also horizontal in part, because
both firms own valve technologies that are economic substitutes for each other. Whether the firms license their valve
technologies to others is not important for the conclusion that the firms have a horizontal relationship in this relevant
market. Even if Alpha's use of its valve technology were solely captive to its own production, the fact that the two
valve technologies are economic substitutes means that the two firms have a horizontal relationship. For the firms
to be in a horizontal relationship, it is also not necessary that Alpha actually uses its valve technology prior to
licensing technology from Beta, provided that Alpha's technology is an economic alternative to Beta's.

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In the vast majority of cases, restraints in intellectual property licensing arrangements are evaluated under the
rule of reason (
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
see 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
section 4). In some cases, however, the courts conclude that a restraint's ``nature and necessary effect are so plainly
anticompetitive'' that it should be treated as unlawful per se, without an elaborate inquiry into the restraint's
purpose and effect,

and market division among horizontal competitors, as well as certain group boycotts and resale price maintenance.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
To determine whether a particular restraint in a licensing arrangement is given per se or rule of reason treatment,
the Department will first determine whether the restraint in question can be expected to contribute to an efficiency-producing
integration of economic activity. In general, licensing arrangements promote such integration because they facilitate
the combination of the licensor's intellectual property with complementary factors of production owned by the licensee.
A restraint in a licensing arrangement may further such integration by, for example, aligning the incentives of the
licensor and the licensees to promote the development and marketing of the licensed technology, or by substantially
reducing transactions costs. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In assessing whether a particular restraint contributes to an efficiency-producing integration, the Department
briefly will review, inter alia, the business of the parties to the license, the markets in question, and the purpose
and effect of the particular restraint. If there is no efficiency-producing integration of economic activity and
if the type of restraint is one that otherwise is appropriately accorded per se treatment, the Department will challenge
the restraint under the per se rule. Otherwise, the Department will apply a rule of reason analysis. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Because licensing arrangements typically involve vertical relationships that create significant integrative
efficiencies, restraints associated with those arrangements usually will have sufficient relationship to an efficiency-producing
integration to merit analysis under the rule of reason. An ordinarily suspect restraint incorporated in a licensing
agreement will not escape per se treatment, however, if the putative integration itself is a sham or if there is an insufficient
relationship between the restraint and an efficiency-producing integration.

Situation: 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Gamma, which manufactures Product X using its patented process, offers a license for its process technology to every
other manufacturer of Product X. The process technology does not represent an economic improvement over the available
existing technologies. Indeed, although several manufacturers accept licenses from Gamma, none of the licensees
actually uses the licensed technology. The licenses provide that each manufacturer has an exclusive right to sell
Product X manufactured using the licensed technology in a designated geographic area and that no manufacturer may
sell Product X, however manufactured, outside the designated territory.

Discussion: 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The manufacturers of Product X are in a horizontal relationship in the goods market for product X. Those that are licensees
of Gamma's process technology would also be in a vertical relationship with Gamma if they actually used Gamma's technology,
although in this example, that is not the case. Any manufacturers of Product X that control technologies that are economic
substitutes for Gamma's process are also horizontal competitors of Gamma in the relevant technology market. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The licensing arrangement restricts competition in the relevant goods market among manufacturers of Product X.
The restriction applies both to Product X that is manufactured with the licensed technology and to Product X manufactured
with any other technology. The latter restriction is the key competitive concern because it harms competition that
would have taken place in the absence of the licensing agreement. Such a restriction could conceivably benefit competition
by promoting the adoption of Gamma's technology (see Example 6). In this example, however, the technology is not being
used despite being licensed. If further investigation shows that there is no likelihood that the manufacturers of
Product X will use Gamma's technology, the Department is likely to conclude that there are no conceivable benefits
from the license restrictions. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
If the Department concludes that the restraint does not contribute to an efficiency-producing integration of economic
activity, the Department would be likely to challenge the arrangement under the per se rule as a horizontal territorial
market allocation scheme and to view the intellectual property aspects of the arrangement as a sham intended to cloak
its true nature. Since such a restraint is per se unlawful, the Department likely would challenge the arrangement
even absent proof of substantial market power by the licensor and the licensees. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The competitive implications do not generally depend on whether the licensed technology is protected by patent,
is a trade secret or other know-how, or is a computer program protected by copyright. Nor do the competitive implications
generally depend on whether the allocation of markets is territorial, as in this example, or functional, based on
fields of use.
