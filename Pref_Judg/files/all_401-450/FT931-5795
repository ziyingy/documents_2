US scientists have identified the rogue immune cells that are responsible
for multiple sclerosis.
The discovery by Stanford University researchers working with Neurocrine
Biosciences, a San Diego-based biotechnology company, could lead eventually
to a cure for MS, which afflicts more than 2.6m people worldwide.
Although MS has been the subject of intensive research activity worldwide,
there is still no effective treatment for the disease, in which the body's
immune system attacks the protective coating of myelin protein around nerve
fibres. This results in progressive paralysis.
The researchers report in the journal Nature today that they have identified
the specific type of white blood cell (T-cell) responsible for the attack -
and matched its genetic sequence to a corresponding gene on the myelin
protein.
By good fortune, it turns out that the same genetic sequence causes MS in
rats; having an animal model always speeds up drug development. Lawrence
Steinman, leader of the Stanford/Neurocrine research team, says the
scientists are following three approaches:
The primary effort is to make a 'molecular decoy' which can attract the
T-cells away from the myelin. Clinical trials of the first candidate could
start next year.
Antibodies or other molecules could be developed to remove or inactivate the
T-cells.
A vaccine could disable the T-cells.
'All three methods focus on blocking or disabling the very specific immune
response that causes this disease, without suppressing the patient's entire
immune system,' Steinman says.
Once a blocking technique has been developed, it may eventually become
possible to use 'growth factors' to repair the damaged tissues in MS
patients.
But the ultimate cause of MS - what triggers the T-cells to attack - is not
yet understood. One theory is that fragments of viruses mimic parts of the
myelin molecule and trigger auto-immunity.
