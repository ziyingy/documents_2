LARGE industrial gas users may pay higher bills as more competition is
introduced into the gas market, Mr Ian Powe, chairman of the Gas Consumers
council, warned yesterday.
British Gas's agreement with the Office of Fair Trading to halve its share
of the industrial gas market in the next three years might see the company
substantially raising the price of its cheapest gas, Mr Powe said. That is
the gas sold to its largest customers on 'interruptible contracts' - meaning
British Gas can cut them off at short notice.
Competitors have shown no interest in entering the interruptible gas market
as it offers low profit margins. Mr Powe believes British Gas might increase
prices for such gas to maintain its profit levels as it loses market share.
Separately, Sir James McKinnon, the gas industry regulator, fired another
salvo in his dispute with British Gas over the rate of return it should earn
for its pipeline business.
Sir James said British Gas should be able to earn between 2.5 per cent and 5
per cent on transporting its own and other companies' gas through its
pipelines.
