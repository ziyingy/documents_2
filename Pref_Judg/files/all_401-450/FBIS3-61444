today the number of abortions is twice that of childbirths''] 
  [Text] Abortion was never a sovereign problem of the 
inherited estate of obstetrics and gynecology. Reflected in it, 
as in a microcosm, is the trouble of the nation, providing a 
foundation for the contradictions regarding the coming 
demographic Apocalypse. The question of artificial termination 
of pregnancy has always been a question of belief. Christian 
teaching, like Islam, considers this sin one of the gravest. 
  According to data from the Social Demography Center of the 
Russian Academy of Sciences, the country's population will 
decrease to 147 million by the end of the millennium: the death 
rate will surpass the birth rate by an average of 1 million 
persons each year. 
  ``Abortion has been the main problem ravaging our land for 
more than 70 years,'' states Professor I. Guzov, leader of the 
Russian Right to Life Movement. ``It was thrust upon us by the 
Russian Bolsheviks, and only after rejecting it can the country 
be reborn.'' 
  In fact, the mass nature of artificial terminations has had 
a 
noticeable effect on the demographic situation. But other 
factors are destabilizing it as well. Let us say, from the 
standpoint of the child mortality level, we are far 
outdistancing the developed countries of the West, and even by 
the most cautious estimates, this indicator is 4 to 6 times 
higher than the ``civilized'' indicator. In recent years, thanks 
to paid medicine, the situation has been complicated by 
physicians' mercenary thinking. 
  The movement against abortion arose in Russia with the 
active 
support of Western religious organizations, particularly the 
Dutch organization Rainbow. In its actions, Right to Life will 
not go as far as what I. Guzov considers to be the ``extremists 
of the Western organization,'' who picket gynecological clinics 
and chain themselves to abortion tables. ``Our main task is to 
inform Russian women of the truth about abortions,'' he 
continues. 
  At the same time, there are organizations such as the 
philanthropic fund Good Hope, which in addition to performing 
educational work, tries to provide specific referral assistance 
to women who have decided to give birth despite their grave 
material and family conditions. Religious communities from 
abroad send them, let's say, sewing machines and material so as 
to help the future parents or single mothers earn a slice of 
bread for themselves. 
  L. Lyubarskaya, chairperson of Good Hope, told of how, 
having 
five children, she took ill. The physicians could not cure her, 
and her husband drove her to a monastery. An old monk who had 
taken vows of schema asked, ``How many children do you have 
little mother?'' ``Five.'' ``And how many years have you been 
married?'' ``Sixteen.'' ``That is the reason why you are ill. 
You have too few children.'' The women soon gave birth and 
recovered. Now she has eight children.... 
  But can the church help every child-loving pregnant woman 
who 
has been left without the resources to exist? As is well known, 
the road to Hell is paved with good intentions. ``The church is 
poor, and philanthropic aid to the fund from abroad is simply 
miserable,'' says L. Lyubarskaya. ``But we are trying as hard as 
we can to make mothers' lives easier.''
