Hurricane Andrew tore across the Bahamas with 150mph winds. Four people were
reported killed. About a million south Florida residents were ordered to
leave their homes as the storm roared on towards Miami. 'We're looking at a
very, very bad storm and it's coming straight at us', said one US official.
