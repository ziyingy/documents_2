  [Text] Guangzhou, June 28 (XINHUA) -- South China's 
Guangdong Province is doing its best to help its flood-hit areas 
resume production and rebuild ruined houses. 
  At a news briefing held here yesterday, Deputy Governor of 
the province Ou Guangyuan said that Guangdong had allocated and 
transferred 300 million kg of grain to flood-stricken areas and 
invested 870 million yuan, including 740 million yuan in loans, 
to help production resume in the flood-hit areas. 
  At the same time, the province has also decided to send 
three 
special working groups to seriously affected areas of Qingyuan 
county, and Shaoguan and Zhaoqing cities to oversee the work of 
resuming production there. 
  Due to strong tropical rainstorms and successive torrential 
rains in Guangdong's western and northern areas since early 
June, floods, which were believed to be the worst in 100 years, 
occurred when the Beijiang and Xijiang Rivers overflowed. 
  The floods hit nine cities and 60 counties, destroyed 
thousands of homes and ruined crops on about 706,667 ha of 
farmland, leaving more than 660,000 people homeless and causing 
direct economic losses estimated at 14.6 billion yuan. 
  But thanks to help from the central government and from 
other 
Chinese provinces, local people, and officers and men of the 
People's Liberation Army co-operated closely in fighting the 
floods and won temporary victory, as the floods have receded 
under the danger mark. 
  Ou said the most urgent task for the time being is to 
guarantee basic living conditions for flood-affected residents 
and work hard to prevent epidemics. 
  Communities in other parts of China and compatriots from 
Hong 
Kong and Macao have donated a total of 50 million yuan to 
Guangdong's flood-hit areas.
