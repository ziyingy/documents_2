  [Excerpt] Lahore, April 22 -- At least 35 Namazis 
including five children, were injured when two grenades exploded 
in the hall of a double storey mosque in Jiya Musa, one km from 
Shahdara here on Friday. 
  Eye-witnesses told The Muslim that the Namazis were offering 
dua [prayers] after performing Asr prayers at 5:20 pm in Jamia 
Masjid Mohammadia when two hand grenades exploded in the mosque 
hall. According to eye-witnesses three youths, who were riding a 
CD-70 motorcycle, hurled two grenades in the mosque from two 
different doors and disappeared. 
  Qari Saeed Mohammad, the Imam of the Mosque, and one of the 
injured, told The Muslim in Mayo Hospital that the mosque 
belonged to Sunni sect. When asked who could be behind this 
incident he said apparently it seemed an act of sectarianism, 
but added that terrorism could not be ruled out. 
  All the injured were rushed to the Mayo Hospital where they 
were given medical treatment. Seven of the injured were 
discharged after necessary medical aid while the remaining were 
still in the hospital. Their condition was stated to be out of 
danger. 
  Till the filing of this report, the concerned police had not 
registered any case against the unidentified culprits. [passage
