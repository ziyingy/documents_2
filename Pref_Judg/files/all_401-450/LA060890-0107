Photo, Quilts as Art: Quilting has come a long way since the days of log cabins 
and hearthside sessions. "Visions -- A New Decade," on display at the Museum of 
San Diego History through July 15, is dedicated to promoting quilts as an art 
form. The Balboa Park show is a juried exhibition that features 83 quilts 
selected from 877 entries worldwide. Hours are 10 a.m. to 5 p.m. Tuesday 
through Sunday. Admission is $4, with children under 12 free. More information 
is available by calling 232-6203.
