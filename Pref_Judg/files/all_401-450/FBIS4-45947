  [Text] New Delhi, April 26 -- Research in atmospheric 
science has received a boost with the commissioning of a unique 
radar at Gadanki near Tirupati, which will also ensure safe 
rocket launchings from Sriharikota, launched 80 km away, reports 
PTI. 
  With this new facility, Indian scientists will be able to 
make a detailed study of lower and middle atmospheres and also 
the region of the ionosphere above 100 km, according to Dr P. 
Balarama Rao, director of this radar facility. 
  A link-up of this radar with control room at Sri Harikota 
will enable space scientists to watch out for turbulence and 
wind shears before a rocket is launched. 
  Called Mesophere-Stratosphere-Troposphere Radar, the Rs 100 
million-facility has been established jointly by five different 
agencies, including, space and defence departments. 
  It consists of a 1024 computer-controlled antenna, arranged 
in 32 rows, whose powerful beam at 53 mega-hertz frequency can 
be aimed at six pre-set directions. 
  Echoes received from the atmosphere are analysed by a 
computer, giving almost instantaneous readings of wind speeds at 
different heights. 
  Atmospheric scientists all over India will have access to 
this MST radar, said to be one of the very few in the world, and 
perhaps the only radar close to the Equator, where the 
atmospheric processes are quite different from those at higher 
latitudes. 
  According to Dr Balarama Rao, the radar will have 
applications ranging from short-term weather forecasting to 
long-term vertical transports of trace elements. It will measure 
vertical wind speeds that cannot be measured from any other 
technique. 
  Dr Rao said the radar also provided Indians the unique 
opportunity to observe "gravity waves" generated by tropical jet 
streams, storms, and interaction of strong winds with large 
mountains. 
  The radar will take only a minute or two to detect wind 
shears and turbulences that could pose hazards to rockets in 
flight.
