ENVIRONMENTAL protection cost Pounds 14bn last year, about 2.5 per cent of
gross domestic product, a government survey said yesterday.
Nearly half, Pounds 6.7bn, was the cost of cleaning up river pollution and
purifying water, it said. Much of that sum is eventually borne by water
customers, whose bills may double in real terms in the next decade as the
water companies comply with EC environmental rules.
Nearly a quarter of the spending, Pounds 3bn, was to reduce pollution by all
kinds of waste. Industry was forced by new laws to spend about Pounds 2.4bn
on curbing air pollution. The balance was spent on cleaning up land and
reducing noise.
The figures, which count only 'pure environmental' investment and probably
underestimate 'green' spending, suggest that government paid a third of the
total bill, with industry and households footing the rest.
The report, which draws together data on the whole UK environment - air
quality, land, water, the sea and coasts, wildlife, waste and radioactivity
 -shows that some standards have deteriorated. Carbon monoxide emissions
rose by 30 per cent since 1980, mainly from transport, and emissions of
black smoke from transport also doubled since then. Average concentrations
of nitrogen dioxide, mainly from traffic, increased by 35 per cent between
1986 and 1991.
However, lead emissions from vehicles, which caused concern for their effect
on children's development, have fallen by 70 per cent since the mid 1980s
with the arrival of unleaded petrol.
About 3 per cent of cancer deaths may derive from radiation exposure, the
report said. Fall-out from nuclear weapons testing and the Chernobyl
accident contribute less than 1 per cent of the annual average dose of
radiation, but radon, a naturally occurring gas, accounts for more than
half.
