Health and Human Services Secretary Louis W. Sullivan says millions of sick, 
elderly or poor Americans will suffer if proposed cuts in his budget are 
implemented. 
</P>
<P>
The reductions would leave Sullivan's agency unable to maintain current 
services in programs like Medicare and Social Security, the secretary said in a 
letter to the White House protesting the Office of Management and Budget's 
proposed cuts. He said the result would be longer processing times for claims. 
</P>
<P>
Sullivan's letter said also that the OMB proposal would provide inadequate 
funds to turn more attention to prenatal care and expansion of programs to 
combat lead poisoning, breast cancer, tuberculosis and AIDS, as the department 
wants to do. 
</P>
<P>
The letter, a copy of which was obtained by the Associated Press, was sent last 
week to OMB Director Richard G. Darman. 
</P>
<P>
A department budget official said that during the past week much progress had 
been made in negotiations with OMB, but he declined to give specifics. The 
negotiations are continuing, he said. 
</P>
<P>
The letter said that cuts in funds for administration of the Health Care 
Financing Administration, which handles Medicare and Medicaid, and the Social 
Security Administration could hurt "our ability to respond to the needs of 50 
million aged and disabled beneficiaries." 
</P>
<P>
Kevin Moley, HHS assistant secretary for management and budget, said that while 
the figure of 50 million was correct when the letter was written a week ago, it 
is "far fewer today than last week, and we expect to resolve those issues by 
the time we announce our budget." 
</P>
<P>
Moley declined to say how much money was in dispute, and the letter did not 
spell out the total. 
</P>
<P>
Sullivan's letter of appeal is part of the annual budget-making process. After 
a department drafts a budget request, OMB reviews it, makes changes and sends 
the resulting proposal, called a "pass back," to the department. The department 
then negotiates with OMB and, if still not satisfied, may appeal to the 
President himself. 
</P>
<P>
OMB's "pass back" to HHS would cut Medicare by $2.7 billion in addition to the 
nearly $6 billion agreed to in the deficit-reduction package approved by the 
Administration and Congress in October.
