  [Text] According to the State Drug Treatment and Health 
Center medical institutions have registered 794 drug addicts and 
358 drug users. In 1993 125 drug addicts were registered and 50 
drug users. Last year 383 drug addicts were treated in various 
medical institutions. 
  For its part in Riga alone there were 2,536 drug addicts, 
people arrested in drug dens and drug dealers, according to the 
information bureau of the National Battle Against Drug Addiction. 
  Unfortunately this is only the visible part of the iceberg. 
Specialists believe that there are six to ten thousand drug 
addicts in Latvia, 80 percent of them under 30 years of age. 
  On 27 February, at 1b Strelnieku Street, in the 
Ziemelblazmas club, at 2:00 pm, people will gather to 
continue working at establishing the movement Parents 
Against Drug Addiction. As NEATKARIGA CINA has already 
written, this movement unites parents in the battle against drug 
addiction in Scandanavia. 
  We remind you of the confidential number for drug addicts: 
391 307.
