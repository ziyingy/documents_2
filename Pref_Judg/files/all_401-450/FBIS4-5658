  [Text] Yokosuka, Yokosuka Pref., April 11 KYODO -- The 
Maritime Safety Agency asked prosecutors Monday [11 April] to 
file charges against three Japanese fishing companies for 
allegedly poaching 2,000 tons of bonito and tuna worth more than 
1.5 billion yen in the southern Pacific Ocean, agency officials 
said. 
  It is the most serious case of illegal fishing yet exposed 
by 
the agency. 
  Longline fishing fleets of Sasashima Gyogyo of Nakaminato, 
Ibaraki Prefecture, and the two other companies are suspected of 
having caught the fish without proper permits off Ecuador and 
Colombia between 1991 and 1993. 
  The agency said the companies had violated Japan's fisheries 
law. 
  The five suspects involved in the case include the owner of 
Sasashima Gyogyo, Toshimasa Sasashima, 51. 
  From Central America, the tuna and bonito hauls were 
allegedly shipped to Japan by freighter and sold for a total of 
1.56 billion yen.
