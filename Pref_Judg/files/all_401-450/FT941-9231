Seeboard, the electricity distributor for south-east England, will be
cutting power prices for business customers by 0.1p a kilowatt hour from
April 1.
The move follows last week's agreement between the two large power
generators and Professor Stephen Littlechild, the electricity regulator, to
restrain prices in the pool, the wholesale market for electricity.
Seeboard's cut will apply to consumers of more than 100 kwh a year who have
signed long-term supply contracts. Seeboard will also be offering the lower
price to other potential customers in that bracket, all of whom will be free
to shop around for electricity from April 1.
Mr Stephen Gutteridge, the company's managing director of supply, said last
night that Seeboard was the first company to make this cut. He said Seeboard
wanted to demonstrate its loyalty to existing customers and sharpen its
ability to compete for the large segment of the market that had not yet
signed up for supply contracts.
Last week's agreement, which includes a commitment by National Power and
PowerGen to sell off several power stations, is supposed to reduce pool
prices by up to 7 per cent. Mr Gutteridge said this was expected to lead to
an average cut of 0.1p per kwh, and that Seeboard was passing on the full
price reduction.
Seeboard had already received several offers from generators to supply it
with electricity at the lower price.
