The state Public Utilities Commission, responding to a request by Southern 
California Edison and San Diego Gas &amp; Electric, on Friday directed its 
staff to end hearings on the controversial merger by Aug. 3. 
</P>
<P>
Although utility spokesmen applauded the ruling, merger opponents said the 
decision will keep them from fully exploring whether the merger would be 
beneficial to Southern Californians. 
</P>
<P>
Opponents also suggested that the decision to close testimony on Aug. 3 will 
open the door to lawsuits should the commission approve the merger. 
</P>
<P>
State Sen. Herschel Rosenthal (D-Los Angeles) said Friday that the PUC has 
violated state law by "arbitrarily rushing the . . . merger proceeding based on 
the commission's desire to reach a decision by the end of 1990." 
</P>
<P>
"This could come back to haunt the PUC," warned Bill Shaffran, a city of San 
Diego attorney who has long represented the city in the merger review. Shaffran 
said the PUC action will prohibit merger opponents, such as the city, from 
completing their cases. 
</P>
<P>
Edison spokesman Lew Phelps, however, praised the decision. 
</P>
<P>
"In a nutshell, we view this as a positive development," he said. "These 
hearings have been going on for . . . a very long time, and it looks as though 
it's going to be two years . . . before it's brought to a close. We think 
that's long enough." 
</P>
<P>
Michael Strumwasser, a Los Angeles-based special assistant to state Atty. Gen. 
John Van de Kamp, who has opposed the merger, said the attorney general's 
office is "increasingly worried that, whatever the commission decides would be 
(negated) because it can be overturned in court because of procedural errors." 
</P>
<P>
Commissioners restricted the hearing's length in order to complete 
deliberations and issue a decision by Dec. 31. The commission hopes to finish 
the case by then because two commissioners' terms expire at year's end, and it 
could be months before their replacements are familiar with the complicated 
case. 
</P>
<P>
Rosenthal, in a prepared statement Friday, complained that "the commission's 
blind adherence to an arbitrary year-end deadline appears to have crossed the 
line from expeditious review to a violation of the basic rights of interested 
parties." 
</P>
<P>
Rosenthal said he intends to hold hearings on the PUC's merger review to 
determine if the commission has fully explored environmental impacts of the 
proposed merger and whether the merger would produce benefits for Southern 
Californians. 
</P>
<P>
Strumwasser also questioned the PUC's desire to move so quickly to complete the 
hearings. 
</P>
<P>
Friday's order "has the suggestion of pre-judgment," he said. "Why are they in 
such a hurry? Is it because (they) don't need to hear the evidence because they 
already know what's going to happen?" 
</P>
<P>
Michael Shames, executive director of the Utility Consumers Action Network, a 
consumer group that opposes the merger, said the PUC decision is "not as bad as 
I expected." 
</P>
<P>
Shames based that opinion on the fact that commissioners had been considering 
an allocation plan that would have divided remaining hearing time among the 
utilities and opponents. That would have been "devastating" to merger 
opponents, who need time to cross-examine utility officials, Shames said. 
</P>
<P>
The PUC instead extended daily hearing times and added six hours of testimony, 
to be taken on Saturdays. The administrative law judges who are conducting the 
hearings will also take steps to speed cross-examination of utility company 
witnesses, sources said. 
</P>
<P>
Still, Shames said, the time limit puts opponents of the merger at a 
disadvantage because, even with longer weekday sessions and additional Saturday 
sessions, "we're not going to get the time we need" to complete 
cross-examinations. 
</P>
<P>
Phil Weismehl, an attorney with the PUC's Division of Ratepayer Advocates, the 
San Francisco-based organization that represents the public in the merger, 
described the six-day workweek as unprecedented in the PUC's history. 
</P>
<P>
"My staff is already suffering from fatigue," said Weismehl, who was home sick 
with a cold Friday. "This is incredibly burdensome to our staff. . . . We'll 
have to see what happens. As everyone gets very tired, the quality of 
presentations may go down." 
</P>
<P>
Fatigue will hurt the DRA, which has six attorneys working on the case, more 
than the utilities, which have mustered a legal force that includes more than 
two dozen attorneys, Weismehl said. 
</P>
<P>
"For Edison, the accelerated schedule and the longer days are not that much of 
a big deal," Weismehl said.
