I have read the editorial with a very great interest and with one reservation: 
The editorial could have added one exception to the treatment of the issue. The 
editorial rightly supports the principle of the prohibition of unilateral 
intervention in violation of the sovereignty of other nations.

Certainly, to intervene militarily in the affairs of another nation is against 
international law and common sense, as in the case of the U.S. in Panama. But 
to intervene in the affairs of another nation whose leaders order the slaughter 
of millions of their own people, as in the case of Cambodia, should not be 
against international law. It is against international law because we are very 
selfish: Really we don't want "to rock the boat."

Giuseppe Mazzini expresses this idea better than I. In speaking of 
nonintervention before the genocide of a nation, he said: "Neutrality is the 
willingness to give up every sense of human mission; it is passive existence; 
the neglect of what makes a people sacred; it is the negation of the Universal 
Right of Nations; it is egoism erected to a principle; it is a political 
atheism."

It is a view to be considered very carefully if we want to continue to be human 
beings and not robots completely insensitive to the suffering of others.
