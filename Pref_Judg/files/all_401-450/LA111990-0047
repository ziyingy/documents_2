The skipper and the chief engineer of the 205-foot Arctic Hero barricaded 
themselves inside the wheelhouse and engine room after about seven of the 45 
crew members rampaged through the vessel Friday, authorities said. The men were 
being held on federal charges in Unalaska, adjacent to Dutch Harbor in the 
Aleutian Islands. Damage to the Seattle-based ship, which catches and processes 
fish, was estimated at $25,000.
