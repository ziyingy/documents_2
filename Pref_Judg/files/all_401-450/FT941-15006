The licence for the Pounds 2.8bn Thorp nuclear reprocessing plant at
Sellafield, Cumbria, became effective yesterday.
The plant, owned by British Nuclear Fuels, is not scheduled to become fully
radioactive until the High Court has heard a challenge to it next month by
Greenpeace, the environment pressure group, and Lancashire County Council.
