  [Text] Shenyang, March 19 (XINHUA) -- A movable 
remote-controlled production robot passed appraisal tests Friday 
[18 March] here in Shenyang, capital of northeast China's 
Liaoning Province. 
  This newly-made robot, made by the Shenyang Robot Research 
and Development Center, the cradle of China's robot industry, 
will be used to work in the dangerous and adverse environment in 
the country's sophisticated industrial sector. 
  Also called "remote-controlled automatic cart," the 420 
kilogram- robot with its two operation hands is capable of 
moving up and down staircases and surmount any obstacles. 
  Through remote control and monitoring, the robot is able to 
fix or remove valves and unscrew nails in complex industrial 
facilities. And it can also perform such functions as doing 
operations, monitoring, testing and maintenance so as to ensure 
safety production and increase efficiency.
