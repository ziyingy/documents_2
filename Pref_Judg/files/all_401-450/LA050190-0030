Ralph Nader's Public Citizen group is clearly misusing nuclear plant statistics 
("Record Exposure of Workers to Radiation Cited -- and Disputed," Part A, April 
11). The data actually show that nuclear workers' average exposures are at an 
all-time low, while the electricity produced by these plants is at an all-time 
high.

The Nader group's exaggerated claims of radiation exposures at nuclear plants 
is a vain attempt to derail this much-needed source of energy.

As a radiation scientist who has worked at these plants, I would like to point 
out that nuclear workers receive relatively small amounts of radiation. The 
amount (390 units per year) is comparable to what the average American receives 
from natural sources (300 units). Natural sources include radioactive minerals 
in the soil and cosmic rays from outer space. This natural radiation is 
considered safe, and so is that received by nuclear workers.
