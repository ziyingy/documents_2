US consumer confidence edged lower in July, following decreases in the two
preceding months, the Conference Board said yesterday, AP-DJ reports from
New York.
The board's consumer confidence index fell to 57.7 from June's revised 58.6,
which was previously reported at 58.9. It said that while the latest decline
was insignificant, the cumulative loss in the index since the start of the
year had been 19 points.
'Clearly, the latest message from the consumer strongly suggests that the
economy still fails to show any convincing signs of a vigorous recovery,'
said Mr Fabian Linden, for the Conference Board.
