Levels Over Britain `Threatening Food Chain'"] 
  [Text] The Earth's protective ozone is at a record low over 
Britain and there are fears that the resulting high levels of 
ultraviolet light could affect pollinating insects and the 
growth of seedlings. 
  Scientists with the Stratospheric Ozone Review Group said 
yesterday that despite measures to phase out ozone-depleting 
chemicals, such as the aerosol gases chlorofluorocarbons (CFCs), 
the layer will continue to be destroyed into the early part of 
next century. 
  By 2005, the levels of ultraviolet light hitting Aberdeen 
could be equivalent to those in mid-France. 
  Joe Farman, of the European Ozone Research Coordinating Unit 
and the man who discovered the ozone hole over Antarctica in 
1985, said the main threat could be to seedlings and 
"pollinating insects at the heart of the food chain." 
  He said that to the best of his knowledge no research had 
been carried out on the links between higher levels of UV and 
insects such as bees increased levels of ultraviolet light may 
damage the leaves of seedlings and kill insects by damaging 
their genetic material. 
  As the ozone layer thins, environmentalists and medical 
researchers fear that the levels of skin cancer will rise. The 
UN has predicted that a 10 per cent decrease in the ozone layer 
will lead to 300,000 more skin cancers a year and 1.75 million 
cataracts. 
  Dr John Pyle of Cambridge University, chairman of the ozone 
review group, said this was unlikely, particularly if people 
took sensible protective measures such as wearing a hat and sun 
cream. 
  The fifth report of the group, which was set up in 1985 by 
the Department of the Environment and the Meteorological Office, 
assesses the results from satellite measurements, aircraft and 
field work. It finds that between May 1992 and May 1993 the 
average global thickness of ozone fell by between 2 and 3 per 
cent. Over northern Europe, however, winter levels of ozone 
slumped by around 25 per cent between 1991 and 1993. 
  The scientists said the sharp decline was partly due to 
unusual weather conditions, in particular a strong and 
persistent anticyclone over the area, and the eruption of Mount 
Pinatubo in the Philippines in June 1991. 
  They also said the destruction was triggered by a build-up 
of 
chlorine chemicals. Such chemicals, released from products such 
as aerosols, refrigerants and fire extinguishers, have been 
shown to be causing the hole over Antarctica, but these are the 
first firm findings showing they are also damaging ozone over 
the northern hemisphere. 
  The scientists said that measures under the Montreal 
Protocol 
to phase out CFCs and some other ozone-depleting chemicals by 
1996 were working, with concentrations beginning to tail off. 
Nevertheless, build-ups of breakdown chemicals, the actual ozone 
killers, will persist into the next century, peaking between 
2000 and 2005. This is likely to trigger a 20 to 25 per cent 
average thinning over Britain and northern Europe since records 
began in 1979. Dr Pyle said the hole over Antarctica was 
unlikely to disappear until 2080. 
  The scientists also called on the Government to save 
Snoopy, the C130 Herculese aircraft operated by the 
Meteorological Research Flight at Farnham, Hampshire. Last week 
The Times reported that the plane, which is involved 
in crucial atmospheric research, was on a Ministry of Defence 
hit list. While America and Germany are building new research 
aircraft, Britain will have none if Snoopy goes. 
  Dr Pyle said the aircraft was not only vital for research, 
but secured Britain a presence in scientific projects of 
international importance.
