EPA believes that the public input that the permitted authority will receive early in the process will assist in the
review of the permit application and result in the development of a draft permit that is responsive to community concerns.
Once the permitting authority completes the draft permit, or the notice of intent to deny the permit, and proposes
it to the public, then the public has the opportunity to review that decision, including any changes that occurred
to the original permit application, since they will be reflected in the draft permit. These changes could include
changes in response to the public comments EPA may have received during its review of the permit application.

d. Requirement for an information repository.

 Proposed &sect;&sect;124.33(a) and 270.30(m) would provide the Director with explicit authority to require the
permit applicant or permittee, respectively, to establish and maintain an information repository. The repository
would allow interested parties to: (1) Access reports, plans, findings, and other informative material relevant
to the facility and the particular issues at hand; and (2) receive information on appropriate opportunities for involvement
during a variety of permitting decisions. EPA expects that the Director would consider requiring a facility to establish
a repository in a limited number of cases where the community expresses a high level of interest. A high level of community
interest could be demonstrated, for example, in such ways as written requests from members of the public, or press
coverage. However, the final decision for requiring the repository is at the Director's discretion. The Director
may also specify any appropriate time period for the repository.

As provided in proposed &sect;124.33(b), the information repository will contain all public information that the
Director determines to be relevant to public understanding of permitting activities at the facility. In general,
the Director would require the facility to make available those reports or documents that provide the most relevant
information about the facility and the best technical basis for decision-making. The information repository could
include some of the following items: copies of the permit application, technical documents directly supporting
the application, maps (i.e., sketched or copied street map) of the proposed location of the facility, notice of deficiencies
(NODs), or summary reports of ground-water and air monitoring results at the facility, if such reports exist for the
facility location. The repository should also contain information on how the public may participate and become involved
during the permitting process. For example, EPA may contribute a fact sheet that outlines public involvement opportunities
within the permit process and how to be put on the facility mailing list. Similarly, the facility may provide information
in the repository on any additional public involvement activities it chooses to conduct. Examples of background
material the facility may maintain in the repository include copies of relevant RCRA regulations and related information,
e.g., fact sheets. The facility may exclude from the repository any material it claims to be confidential business
information (CBI). Examples of CBI could include trade secrets, commercial, or financial information whose general
availability could cause substantial harm to the facility's competitive position. The contents and size of the information
repository may differ among sites, depending upon the reasons for setting up the repository, the permitting phase
of the facility, and the site-specific characteristics of the facility.

The facility is responsible for site selection and maintenance of the information repository. The facility should
place the repository at a local public library, town hall, county courthouse, community college, public health office,
or another public location within reasonable distance of the facility. In instances where such a location is not feasible
due to the remote location of the facility, the Director may require the facility to establish and maintain the repository
at some other suitable location. In most instances, the information repository should not be at the facility. Interested
communities have expressed a greater comfort level with siting the repository at a public location, instead of within
facility boundaries. The repository must also be open to the public during reasonable hours or accessible by appointment.
Reasonable hours could include, for example, weekend and evening hours of access (e.g., beyond normal business hours),
depending, among other things, on work schedules of the interested individuals, the degree of public interest in
the facility permitting activities, the convenience of the location of the repository, and the timing of public meetings
or hearings. In these situations, EPA encourages facilities to select a location that already has extended hours
of operation, such as a local library.

EPA encourages facilities to establish the information repository at a location that has reasonable access to a photocopy
machine, if possible. Such a location would be more convenient for the people who wish to make copies of any of the materials
at reasonable cost. For example, some of the public locations mentioned previously should, in most cases, have a photocopy
machine on the premises. If it is not possible, the facility may want to explore other options, such as providing extra
copies of documents that people can keep without charge or at reasonable cost.
