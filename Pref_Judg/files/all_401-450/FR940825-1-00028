<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
As required under title V of the Clean Air Act as amended on November 15, 1990 (``the Act''), the EPA has promulgated
rules which define the minimum elements of an approvable State operating permits program and the corresponding standards
and procedures by which the EPA will approve, oversee, and withdraw approval of a State operating permits program
(see 57 FR 32250 (July 21, 1992)). These rules are codified at 40 Code of Federal Regulations (CFR) part 70. Title V requires
States to develop, and submit to the EPA, programs for issuing these operating permits to all major stationary sources
and to certain other sources.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Act requires that States develop and submit these programs to the EPA by November 15, 1993, and that the EPA act to
approve or disapprove each program within one year after receiving the submittal. The EPA's program review occurs
pursuant to section 502 of the Act and the part 70 regulations, which together outline criteria for approval and disapproval.
Where a program substantially, but not fully, meets the requirements of 40 CFR part 70, the EPA may grant the program
interim approval for a period of up to two years. If the EPA has not fully approved a program by two years after the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
November 15, 1993, date, or by the end of an interim program, it must establish and implement a Federal program.

1. Support Materials 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Pursuant to section 502(d) of the Act, the Governor of each State is required to develop and submit to the Administrator
an operating permits program under State or local law or under an interstate compact, meeting the requirements of
title V of the Act. Louisiana submitted, under the signature of Governor Edwin W. Edwards, the operating permits program,
prepared by LDEQ, to be implemented in all areas of the State of Louisiana with the exception of Indian Lands. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In the LDEQ operating permits program submittal, LDEQ does not assert jurisdiction over Indian lands or reservations.
To date, no tribal government in Louisiana has authority to administer an independent air program in the State. Upon
promulgation of the Indian air regulations, the Indians will then be able to apply as a State, and receive the authority
from the EPA to implement an operating permits program under title V of the Act. The EPA will, where appropriate, conduct
a Federal title V operating permits program in accordance with forthcoming EPA regulations, for those Indian tribes
which do not apply for treatment as States under the Act. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
40 CFR 70.4(b)(1) requires that the submittal contain a program description of Louisiana's operating permits program
describing how LDEQ intends to carry out its responsibilities under the part 70 regulations. The program description,
contained in Volume I of the submittal, explains that this operating permits program was developed to satisfy all
of the requirements of 40 CFR part 70. The operating permits program will incorporate the review and issuance procedures
for part 70 operating permits into the existing State preconstruction permit review and issuance procedures. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The program description contains a description of the organizational structure of the LDEQ Air Quality Division
and a description of the agency's permit related responsibilities. The Air Quality Division is divided into nine
sections. Through the Small Business Assistance Section, the LDEQ provides technical assistance to small businesses
to help them comply with new regulations under the Act. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
40 CFR 70.4(b)(3) requires the Governor to submit a legal opinion from the Attorney General (or the attorney for the
State air pollution control agency that has independent legal counsel) demonstrating adequate authority to carry
out all aspects of a title V operating permits program. The State of Louisiana submitted an Attorney General's Opinion
under the First Assistant Attorney General's signature demonstrating adequate legal authority as required by Federal
law and regulation for source category-limited interim approval as further discussed below. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Attorney General's Opinion contains documentation of adequate legal authority to carry out the issuance of permits
to all sources subject to the requirements of the part 70 regulations, and to promulgate regulations in compliance
with applicable State and Federal laws. The Attorney General's Opinion cites 30 Louisiana Revised Statute (L.R.S.)
2023, which establishes a maximum permit term of ten years, and allows LDEQ to modify a permit for cause in accordance
with law, rule or regulation. Through these statutory provisions LDEQ has developed regulations which provide a
five-year permit term for all sources, and which allow permits to be terminated, modified, or revoked and reissued
for cause. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The LDEQ has the authority to enforce the regulations either through an administrative action to require compliance
or a civil action to compel compliance and recover penalties. Penalties for administrative and civil enforcement
are consistent with the penalty requirements contained in 40 CFR 70.11. The State also possesses criminal authority
to compel enforcement. However, for criminal violations, the State law requires a willful and knowing violation,
while part 70 only requires a knowing violation. The Attorney General's Opinion demonstrates through case law that
there is no distinction between these two requirements under Louisiana law. Therefore, this difference is not a defect
for purposes of part 70. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
30 L.R.S. section 2025(F)(1) provides that an emission of any substance in contravention of regulations, permit
terms, and conditions pursuant thereto, that endangers or that could endanger human life or health, is a felony subject
to a fine of not more than $1,000,000 or the cost of cleanup, and an additional fine of up to $100,000 per violation, which
may be assessed for each day the violation continues, and imprisonment of up to ten years. 30 L.R.S. section 2025(F)(2)
requires that a person who commits a violation of an emission limitation or non-emission related applicable requirement
or permit condition that does not endanger or could not endanger human life or health is guilty of a misdemeanor and
may be fined not more that $25,000 per violation, which may be assessed for each day the violation continues and imprisonment
of up to one year. This is consistent with 40 CFR 70.11 which requires criminal penalties to be recoverable in a maximum
amount of not less than $10,000 per day per violation for any knowing violation of any applicable requirement, any
permit condition, or fee or filing requirement.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
All records of LDEQ are available to the public under 44 L.R.S. sections 1 and 31, unless the Secretary determines that
disclosure would either impair an ongoing investigation or disclose trade secrets. This statute provides that certain
environmental information such as air emission data may not be held confidential. However, it is not clear whether
these confidentiality provisions could be interpreted to protect from disclosure the contents of the permit itself.
As a condition of full approval, LDEQ will be required either to submit an Attorney General's Opinion demonstrating
that its statute is interpreted not to allow any portion of a permit to be held confidential, consistent with section
503(e) of the Act, or to revise Louisiana Administrative Code (LAC) 33:III. Chapter 5, AQ#70, section 517.F to clarify
that no portion of the permit may be considered confidential.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The State statute requires judicial review and a civil judicial order to proceed with permit issuance as the only remedy
available for failure of LDEQ to act on a permit application within the specific time requirements. The judicial review
provided by the State meets the requirements of 40 CFR part 70.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
30 L.R.S. sections 2011(D)(2), 2022, and 2023 of the State statute allows LDEQ discretionary authority to issue variances.
The EPA regards this provision as wholly external to the operating permits program submittal and therefore the statutory
variance provision is not being approved as part of the title V operating permits program. Any variances that may be
issued by LDEQ will not have the effect of revising the title V permit or relieving the source from compliance with any
requirements of the Act unless the variance is processed through title V modification procedures. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Attorney General's opinion has demonstrated that oil and gas wellheads and pipelines will not constitute part
70 sources. Such a demonstration was required by the State statutory provision at 30 L.R.S. section 2022(C)(1) which
allowed for default issuance of State permits to wellheads and pipelines 74 days after receipt of a permit application
by the permitting authority. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Attorney General's opinion has also demonstrated that cotton gins will not constitute part 70 sources. This demonstration
was required because the State statute prohibits the State from regulating controlled burning of cotton gin agricultural
wastes in connection with cotton gin operations. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
30 L.R.S. section 2054(B)(2)(b) provides that the Secretary of the LDEQ has no jurisdiction or authority to make any
regulation with respect to burning of agricultural by-products in the field in connection with the planting, harvesting
or processing of agricultural products, or with respect to controlled burning in connection with timber stand management
or with respect to controlled burning of pastureland or marshland in connection with trapping or livestock production.
These sources do not meet the part 70 definition of major source because air emissions from these sources are fugitive,
and 40 CFR 70.2 does not require that fugitive emissions be counted in determining whether such sources are major for
purposes of section 302(j) of the Act or title I nonattainment definitions of ``major source.'' Therefore, the State's
lack of authority to permit the types of controlled burning described in this section of Louisiana law is not a defect
in Louisiana's part 70 operating permits program.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
40 CFR 70.4(b)(4) requires the submission of relevant permit program documentation not contained in the regulations,
such as permit forms and relevant guidance to assist in the State's implementation of its operating permits program.
The State addresses this requirement in Volumes I and III of its title V operating permits program submittal. Volume
III contains a model permit, application forms and instructions, including the standard Phase II acid rain forms.
Volume I contains a description of the State's compliance tracking and enforcement program, including the criteria
for monitoring source compliance.

The State of Louisiana has submitted Air Quality Division regulations LAC 33:III. Chapter 5, AQ#70&hyph;''Permit
Procedures'' (``the permit regulations'') and LAC 33:III. Chapter 65, AQ#76&hyph;''Rules and Regulations for
the Fee System of the Air Quality Control Programs'' (``the fee regulations''), for implementing the State's operating
permits program as required by 40 CFR 70.4(b)(2). Sufficient evidence of their procedurally correct adoption was
submitted in Volume III of the submittal. Copies of all applicable State and local statutes and regulations which
authorize the part 70 program, including those governing State administrative procedures, were submitted with
the State's program. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The following requirements, set out in the EPA's part 70 regulation, are addressed in the State's submittal: (1) Provisions
to determine applicability (40 CFR 70.3(a)): AQ#70 section 507.A.1; (2) Provisions to determine complete applications
(40 CFR 70.5(a)(2)) and program documentation (40 CFR 70.4(b)(4)): AQ#70 section 519 and AQ#70 section 517 respectively,
and Volume III, Permit Forms and Instructions; (3) Public Participation (40 CFR 70.7(h)): AQ#70 section 531.A; (4)
Provisions for minor permit modifications (40 CFR 70.7(e)(2)): AQ#70 section 525; (5) Provisions for permit content
(40 CFR 70.6(a)); Volume III, Permit Forms and Instructions; (6) Provisions for operational flexibility (40 CFR
70.4(b)(12)): AQ#70 section 507.G; (7) Provisions to determine insignificant activities (40 CFR 70.4(b)(2)):
A list of insignificant activities was not included with the submittal and may be submitted as a revision at a later
date; (8) Enforcement provisions (40 CFR 70.4(b)(5) and 70.4(b)(4)(ii)): 30 L.R.S. section 2025.F and Volume I,
Enforcement and Compliance Programs.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Following is a discussion of certain specific provisions in the State's submission as they relate to requirements
of 40 CFR part 70:
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG QTAG 02 -->
<!-- PJG /QTAG -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
(a) Applicability criteria, including any criteria used to determine insignificant activities or emissions levels
(40 CFR 70.4(b)(2) and 70.3(a)): These requirements are met by AQ#70 section 517 which requires the permit application
to include information regarding emissions from sources of all regulated air pollutants and does not allow an exemption
for insignificant activities. The permit regulations require that the applicable sources submit an application
prior to construction, reconstruction, or modification which may result in an increase in air contaminants. AQ#70
section 507.A.3 requires that permits incorporate all federally applicable requirements for each emissions unit
at the source. AQ#70 section 507.A requires all major sources, all sources required to obtain an operating permit
pursuant to regulations promulgated under sections 111 or 112 of the Act (except sources that would be required to
obtain a permit solely because they are regulated sources pursuant to section 112(r) of the Act), and all affected
sources under the acid rain program to apply for and receive an operating permit. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Because of a regulation involving research and development (R &amp; D) facilities discussed below, the State will
lack authority to ensure that all part 70 sources submit an application in the first year after interim approval. This
defect in the State's authority will render the interim approval granted to the Louisiana operating permits program,
a source category-limited interim approval. Further discussion of this issue follows. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
AQ#70 section 501.B.7 provides that the permitting authority may allow a
<!-- PJG 0101 clearpage -->
 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
certain complex within a facility to be considered as a source separate from the facility with which it is co-located,
provided that the complex is used solely for R &amp; D of new processes and/or products, and is not engaged in the manufacture
of products for commercial sale. The permit regulations are inconsistent with 40 CFR 70.3 which requires that a State's
operating permits program provide for the permitting of all major sources, and 40 CFR 70.4(b)(3)(i) which requires
that the State demonstrate adequate legal authority to issue permits and assure compliance with each applicable
requirement by all part 70 sources. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Confusion over this issue has occurred as a result of language in the preamble to the final July 21, 1992, 40 CFR part
70 rulemaking (57 FR 32264). The preamble language indicates that States would have the flexibility in many cases
to treat R &amp; D facilities separately from the manufacturing facilities with which they are co-located. The EPA
intended for this language to clarify the flexibility in part 70 for allowing R &amp; D facilities to be treated separately
in cases where the R &amp; D facility has a different two-digit Standard Industrial Classification (``SIC'') code
and is not a support facility. This approach is consistent with the treatment of R &amp; D facilities in the New Source
Review program. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
40 CFR 70.2 requires all sources located on contiguous or adjacent properties, under common control, and belonging
to a single major industrial grouping to be considered as the same source. The Louisiana permit regulations could
cause certain part 70 major sources, as defined in 40 CFR 70.2, or portions of such sources with the same SIC code, to
be treated as separate sources. This could cause some part 70 sources to be exempted from coverage by part 70 permits
which must ensure all part 70 requirements for these sources are met.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The EPA's August 2, 1993, guidance provides that the EPA can grant source category-limited interim approval to States
whose programs do not provide for permitting all required sources if the State makes a showing that two criteria are
met: (1) That there were ``compelling reasons'' for the exclusions; and (2) that all required sources will be permitted
on a schedule that ``substantially meets'' the requirements of 40 CFR part 70. The EPA considers Louisiana's misinterpretation
of the preamble language to be a compelling reason for granting this type of interim approval. Louisiana has not requested
additional time for issuing initial permits. In addition, it has been estimated that a small number of major sources
will be deferred from permitting due to the Louisiana R &amp; D provision, and that such sources can still be permitted
within the three-year time frame. This substantially meets the requirements of 40 CFR part 70. Also, for these reasons,
the EPA is not requesting a detailed, written analysis supporting the State's claim that its program substantially
meets the part 70 applicability requirement.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Source category-limited interim approval will allow Louisiana to develop a permitting schedule to provide for the
permitting of any ``exempted'' sources during the latter part of the program's three-year transition period, after
the permit regulations have been revised.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Notwithstanding the granting of source category-limited interim approval based on the possibility that some major
sources will not be required to submit applications within the first year after program approval, the EPA expects
that any permits issued will address all applicable requirements, as required by 40 CFR 70.7(a)(1)(iv).
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
For full part 70 approval, the LDEQ will be required to revise its permit regulations and demonstrate that no source
or portion of a source which would be defined as major under 40 CFR 70.2 will be exempted from part 70 requirements because
an R &amp; D facility is co-located with the source. Guidance on the R &amp; D issue is expected to be forthcoming from
the EPA Office of Air Quality Planning and Standards in the near future.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
AQ#70 section 502 defines ``title I modification'' as a change at a site that qualifies as a modification under section
111 of the Act, or section 112(g) of the Act, or that results in a significant net emissions increase under part C or part
D of the Act. The EPA believes the phrase ``modifications under any provision of title I of the Act'' in 40 CFR 70.7(e)(2)(i)(A)(5)
is best interpreted to mean literally any change at a source that would trigger permitting authority review under
regulations approved or promulgated under title I of the Act. This would include State preconstruction review programs
approved by the EPA into the State Implementation Plan (SIP) under section 110(a)(2)(C) of the Act and regulations
addressing source changes that trigger National Emission Standards for Hazardous Air Pollutants (NESHAPS) established
pursuant to section 112 prior to the 1990 amendments. The EPA intends to revise its criteria for interim approval in
40 CFR 70.4(d) prior to final approval on the proposal to grant Louisiana interim approval so that interim approval
may be granted to State programs, like Louisiana's, that adopt a narrower definition of ``title I modification''
than the Federal definition. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
As noted, the EPA believes the better interpretation of ``title I modification'' would preclude granting full approval
to the Louisiana operating permits program. However, in the proposal to revise 40 CFR part 70, the EPA will be taking
comment on whether the criteria in 40 CFR 70.7(e)(2)(i)(A), including the phrase ``modification under any provision
of title I,'' should be interpreted in a manner that would allow the minor modification process to be used for changes
reviewed under programs approved pursuant to section 110(a)(2)(C) of the Act and changes that trigger the application
of NESHAPS established pursuant to section 112 of the Act prior to the 1990 amendments. Should the EPA adopt this alternative
interpretation of ``title I modification'' which allows the minor modification process to be used for changes reviewed
under programs approved pursuant to section 110(a)(2)(C) of the Act and changes that trigger the application of NESHAPS
established pursuant to section 112 of the Act prior to the 1990 amendments, the definition of ``title I modification''
in Louisiana's operating permits program would then be fully consistent with the 40 CFR part 70 ``title I modification''
definition without change. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
With regard to the definition of ``major source'', the definition in AQ#70 section 502 is broader than the part 70 definition
because it does not require the sources to belong to a single major industrial grouping. This is approvable under part
70, and will result in more sources being covered by the State's operating permits program than would be required by
the part 70 definition of ``major source.''
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(b) Permit application requirements (40 CFR 70.5(c)): These requirements are addressed in AQ#70 section 517. In
addition to the information required to be submitted by 40 CFR 70.5(c), the permit regulations also require the submittal
of a location map of the facility. AQ#70 section 507.G provides for alternative operating scenarios, consistent
with the requirements of 40 CFR 70.4(b)(12), and requires the sources requesting alternative operating scenarios
to submit the information in accordance with AQ#70 section 517.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(c) Permit issuance and revision procedures (40 CFR 70.7): These requirements are met by the permit regulations.
AQ#70 section 507.C.1 requires all existing sources to submit an application within one year of the effective date
of the State's operating permits program approval. AQ#70 section 507.C.2 requires that a permit application be submitted
prior to construction, reconstruction, or modification of any source. Permit applications for renewal are required
at least six months prior to the date of permit expiration, but not more than eighteen months prior to the date of permit
expiration. The permit regulations contain criteria for determining completeness of applications consistent
with 40 CFR 70.5(a)(2). Consistent with 40 CFR 70.7, the permit regulations prohibit a source from operating after
the time that the source is required to submit a timely and complete application. AQ#70 section 507.B includes provisions
for continuing permits or permit terms if a timely and complete application is submitted, but action is not taken on
a request prior to permit expiration consistent with 40 CFR 70.4(b)(10). 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
AQ#70 section 507.C.1.b contains the deadlines for submittal of acid rain permit applications. Although this section
purports to cover all relevant dates for submittal of acid rain permit applications, however, this section does not
contain the deadlines required by 40 CFR 72.30(b)(2)(iii) for new units and for units that did not serve a generator
with a name plate capacity greater than 25 Megawatts electrical on November 15, 1990, but which serve such a generator
after November 15, 1990. AQ#70 section 505.D.2 contains the deadlines for submittal of acid rain permit applications
consistent with those required by title IV of the Act, but contradicts AQ#70 section 507.C.1.b. Even though AQ#70
section 505.A.4 states that any requirement, provision, or emissions limitation of the Federal regulations of the
acid rain program, where applicable to an affected source, shall supersede LAC 33:III Chapter 5 of the Louisiana Regulations
to the extent that such Federal regulations are inconsistent with those permit regulations, the inconsistency between
AQ#70 section 505.D.2, 507.C.1.b and the Federal acid rain regulations creates a lack of clarity and should be eliminated.
Therefore, for full part 70 approval, AQ#70 section 507.C.1.b must be revised to require the affected sources to comply
with the deadlines in LAC 33.III.505.D.2 consistent with 40 CFR parts 70 and 72.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
AQ#70 section 519 contains provisions regarding completeness determinations and requests for additional information
consistent with 40 CFR 70.4(b)(6), 70.5(a)(2) and 70.7(a)(4). Requirements for application contents are found
in AQ#70 section 517.D and are consistent with 40 CFR 70.5(c).
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
AQ#70 section 521 contains the requirements for administrative amendments. AQ#70 section 521.A.5 allows an administrative
amendment for the incorporation of changes to render preconstruction permit terms and conditions consistent with
emissions data and operating parameters as determined by start-up testing results provided the following criteria
are met: a. The changes are a result of a test performed upon start-up of newly constructed, installed, or modified
equipment or operations; b. increases in permitted emissions will not exceed 5 tons per year for any regulated pollutant;
c. increases in permitted emissions of Louisiana toxic air pollutants or of Federal hazardous air pollutants would
not constitute a modification under LAC 33:III. Chapter 51 or under section 112(g) of the Act; d. changes in emissions
would not require new source review for prevention of significant deterioration or nonattainment, and would not
trigger the applicability of any federally applicable requirement; e. changes in emissions would not qualify as
a significant modification; f. the request is submitted no later than 12 months after commencing operation; and g.
the permit contains a term which provides for the incorporation of test results by administrative amendment in accordance
with the section entitled ``Administrative Amendments.'' The EPA considers these provisions to be similar in many
respects to the authority allowed for reasonably anticipated operating scenarios without a permit revision under
40 CFR 70.6(a)(9), because the permit will give adequate notice of and provide limitations on the changes that may
occur through a subsequent administrative amendment. In addition, these provisions are consistent with part 70
revision procedures because they achieve substantially the same result as would be the case if Louisiana's preconstruction
and operating permitting programs were separate. Since, if these programs were separate, 40 CFR 70.5(a)(1)(ii)
and 70.4(b)(14) together would allow changes to preconstruction permits to occur prior to revision of the part 70
permit (unless such changes conflicted with an existing part 70 permit), the use of an expedited revision procedure
for incorporation of test results, such as that in AQ#70 section 521.A.6, produces substantially equivalent results
where the preconstruction and operating permit programs are merged. In light of these considerations, the EPA believes
this provision is consistent with part 70.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
AQ#70 section 521.A.6 provides that an administrative amendment may be used to revise a permit for changes that would
not violate any applicable requirement or standard, which do not require permit modifications under 40 CFR part 70
and which the permitting authority considers to be similar in nature to the changes listed in that subsection. This
provision could be interpreted to allow administrative amendments to permits to incorporate changes authorized
by 40 CFR 70.4(b)(14). These ``off-permit'' changes, which are not addressed or prohibited by the permit, may be made
under part 70 without permit revisions. However, the part 70 rule contains no authority for such changes to be incorporated
into operating permits except through the appropriate part 70 permit procedures, which may be either a minor or significant
modification. Therefore, for full part 70 approval, section 521.A.6 must be revised to eliminate administrative
amendments for this type of change. In the interim, the EPA expects Louisiana to implement this provision in a manner
consistent with 40 CFR part 70.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
AQ#70 section 521.A.6 also allows changes to be made to operating permits by administrative amendment where the State's
permitting authority has determined they are similar to the changes listed in AQ#70 section 521.A. Part 70 allows
changes submitted as part of a State's part 70 program, in addition to those specified in 40 CFR 70.7(d)(1), to be made
as administrative amendments where the EPA Administrator determines those changes to be similar to the changes listed
in 40 CFR 70.7(d)(1)(i)-(iv). However, no such proposed changes were submitted by the State as part of its operating
permits program, and part 70 does not allow for the substitution of the State permitting authority's approval for
the Administrator's approval, which is required by 40 CFR 70.7(d)(1)(vi). Therefore, for full part 70 approval,
this defect in AQ#70 section 521.A.6 of the permit regulations must be corrected. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The requirements of 40 CFR 70.4(b)(13), (16), 70.7(h), and 70.8 for permit issuance, renewals, reopenings and revisions,
including public notice, and EPA and affected State review are met by the provisions of AQ#70 sections 519, 531, and
533. AQ#70 section 533.B of the permit regulations requires the applicant, rather than the permitting authority,
to submit the permit applications directly to the Administrator. The notification to affected States will be provided
by the permitting authority within 5 working days of receipt of a complete permit application as required by 40 CFR
part 70. AQ#70 sections 533.C and D and 531.B provide EPA review, objection and affected State notice only for major
sources. The Administrator may, at the time of an operating permits program approval, waive the requirement for affected
State and EPA review for any category of sources other than major sources pursuant to 40 CFR 70.8(a)(2). Pursuant to
40 CFR 70.3(b)(1), the State is, under AQ#70 section 507.A.1, also deferring from the part 70 program at this time,
non-major sources with the exception of acid rain sources and solid waste incineration units required to obtain permits
pursuant to section 129(e) of the Act. This deferral is acceptable under 40 CFR 70.3(b)(1) until the Administrator
completes a rulemaking to determine how the program should be structured for non-major sources and whether any permanent
exemptions in addition to those provided for in 40 CFR 70.3(b)(4) are appropriate.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The requirements of 40 CFR 70.7(e) for minor modification procedures are established in AQ#70 section 525. 40 CFR
70.7(e)(2) allows the use of these expedited minor modification procedures for certain types of changes. Among other
limitations, the minor modification procedures may not be used for any changes to ``case-by-case'' determinations.
AQ#70 section 525.A.2 of the permit regulations defines the criteria for minor modifications. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Questions have been raised concerning whether the 40 CFR 70.7(e)(2)(i)(A)(3) provisions prohibiting changes in
``case-by-case'' determinations would apply in the instance of a preconstruction permit in which the permitting
authority, through a minor modification procedure, changes a source-specific control technology requirement
not required under part C or D or section 111 or 112 of the Act, or an emission limitation determination established
on a source-specific basis. The EPA believes the better interpretation of 40 CFR 70.7(e)(2)(i)(A)(3) requires that
any requirement imposed on a source-specific basis, such as one in which the permitting authority has discretion
in setting the requirement for the particular source, must be considered to be a ``case-by-case'' determination.
Therefore, the EPA believes that a change involving a source-specific requirement in a preconstruction permit would
be considered a ``case-by-case determination of an emission limitation'' under 40 CFR 70.7(e)(2)(i)(A)(3), ineligible
for processing as a minor permit modification. AQ#70 section 525.A.2.d allows the use of minor modification procedures
for some changes which would be considered ``case-by-case'' emission limits under the interpretation referred
to above. The EPA intends to revise 40 CFR part 70 to make interim approval possible for a State which uses the approach
taken in the Louisiana operating permits program for the ``case-by-case'' restriction. The EPA is also soliciting
comment in the proposal to revise 40 CFR part 70 with regard to whether the criteria in 40 CFR 70.7(e)(2)(i)(A)(3) should
be interpreted to allow source specific minor preconstruction permit review changes in control technology determinations
or emission limitation determinations to be eligible for minor modification procedures. Should EPA decide in favor
of this interpretation, Louisiana's approach to the ``case-by-case'' restriction would be fully consistent with
40 CFR part 70 without change. If the EPA decides, instead, to adopt its current position described above, the Louisiana
operating permits program would be inconsistent with 40 CFR part 70 requirements, because it allows changes in control
technology determinations and emission limitation determinations among other changes that may fall within the
40 CFR 70.7(e)(2)(i)(A)(3) restriction to be processed through the minor modification procedures. Therefore,
as a condition of full part 70 approval, Louisiana would be required to revise these permit regulations to provide
that such changes must be processed as significant modifications, as required by 40 CFR 70.7(e)(4). 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
AQ#70 section 525 requires that the application for a minor modification be submitted to and approved by the permitting
authority prior to making the proposed change at the source. AQ#70 section 525.B.6 states that for any minor modification
pertaining to a change which affects federally enforceable permit terms and conditions at a part 70 source, the terms
of the permit revision shall not be federally enforceable pursuant to 40 CFR part 70 until after the required EPA 45-day
review period has expired or until the EPA has notified the permitting authority that the EPA will not object to final
issuance of the permit modification, whichever is first. If the permitting authority has issued approval of the modification
prior to such time, the terms of the permit revision shall be enforceable by the State upon approval by the permitting
authority consistent with the approved SIP. AQ#70 section 525.B.7 further provides that, if at any time after the
approval by the permitting authority the EPA objects, the permit will be reopened. This is consistent with 40 CFR 70.7(e)(2)(v).
This section of the permit regulations provides time-frames for action on the minor modification applications consistent
with 40 CFR 70.7(e)(2)(iv). The permit regulations do not provide for group processing of minor modifications for
groups of sources. Since the requirements in 40 CFR part 70 for group processing are not mandatory, this is acceptable.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
AQ#70 section 527 addresses the criteria for significant modifications and substantially meets the requirements
of 40 CFR 70.7(e)(4). AQ#70 section 527.A.3, in allowing certain changes that render existing compliance terms irrelevant
to be incorporated through minor modification procedures, appears to refer to changes such as those described in
40 CFR 70.4(b)(14), ``off-permit'' changes. However the language of the permit regulations is unclear and requires
clarification. To remedy this defect, the State should add language clarifying that the modification is one which
would qualify as a change under 40 CFR 70.4(b)(14) because it is not addressed or prohibited by the permit and would
otherwise qualify for treatment as a minor modification under 40 CFR 70.7(e)(2)(i)(A). 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Provisions for permit reopenings are addressed in AQ#70 section 529 and are consistent with the requirements of 40
CFR 70.7(f).
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
40 CFR 70.8(a)(3) requires that each State permitting authority keep for five years such records as the Administrator
may reasonably require to ascertain whether the State program complies with the requirements of the Act and 40 CFR
part 70. 44 L.R.S. section 1 contains a very broad definition of ``public records.'' 44 L.R.S. section 36 requires
the records to be kept for three years unless a longer formal retention schedule has been developed. As a condition
of full part 70 approval, a statutory change will be necessary or a supplemental Attorney General's Opinion will need
to be submitted demonstrating how the current statute ensures that the required records will be kept for at least five
years. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(d) Permit Content (40 CFR 70.6(a)): The permit content requirements of 40 CFR 70.6(a) are met by the model permit submitted
in Volume III of the State's part 70 submittal. However, 40 CFR 70.4(b)(16) also requires provisions in the State's
program implementing the requirements of 40 CFR 70.6 and 70.7. To meet these part 70 requirements, AQ#70 sections
501.C.5 and 6 speak generally to permit terms and conditions, but do not set out all requirements for each operating
permit. Specifically they do not include a requirement that the permit specify the origin of and reference the authority
for each term or condition, nor do they identify differences in form from the applicable requirements upon which the
terms are based. Other elements required by 40 CFR 70.6 are also not addressed. 40 CFR 70.6(a) includes requirements
for emission limitations, monitoring and recordkeeping, and specifies that the regulation must state that no permit
revision shall be required under any approved economic incentive, marketable permits or similar program. A severability
clause is also required to ensure the continued validity of the various permit requirements in the event of a challenge
to any portion of the permit. These elements must be addressed in the permit regulations in order to afford citizens
the opportunity to legally challenge permits. Although some of these elements are contained in the State's model
operating permit, one condition of full part 70 approval will be that the permit regulations be revised to require
that all permit elements of 40 CFR 70.6(a) be included in each permit. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
AQ#70 section 507.H meets the compliance requirements of 40 CFR 70.6(c). General permits as allowed by 40 CFR 70.6(d)
and temporary sources as allowed by 40 CFR 70.6(e) are provided for in AQ#70 sections 513.A and 513.B, respectively.
These sections meet the requirements of 40 CFR part 70.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
40 CFR 70.6(f) provides that the State may allow a provision in the part 70 permit stating that compliance with the conditions
of the permit shall be deemed compliance with any applicable requirement as of the date of permit issuance provided
certain requirements are met. AQ#70 section 507.I allows a very restricted use of such a ``permit shield.'' If the
permit does not specifically state that a permit shield exists for a specific Federal program, no shield is presumed
to exist. AQ#70 section 507.I requires all permit shields to undergo public notice requirements.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
40 CFR 70.6(g) contains provisions which state that certain ``emergencies'' may constitute affirmative defenses
to actions for noncompliance. AQ#70 section 507.J provides emergency provisions consistent with those of 40 CFR
70.6(g), using the term ``upset'' rather than ``emergency.'' 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
40 CFR 70.4(b)(12) requires that the State's part 70 submittal contain operational flexibility provisions. AQ#70
section 507.G provides for operational flexibility consistent with 40 CFR 70.4(b)(12).
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The permit regulations do not include a definition of ``emissions allowable under the permit,'' because the State
interprets the plain meaning of this term to be clear in the context of the permit regulations without further definition.
The EPA agrees that the Louisiana permit regulations taken as a whole adequately define ``emissions allowable under
the permit.''
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(e) Off-permit (40 CFR 70.4(b)(14) and (70.4(b)(15)): Section 507.F of the permit regulations allows off-permit
changes which meet the requirements and provisions of 40 CFR 70.4(b)(14) and (15).

3. Permit Fee Demonstration 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The fees for criteria air pollutants contained in the fee regulations are below the presumptive minimum; therefore
a detailed fee demonstration was submitted in Volume I of the title V operating permits program submittal. The fee
regulations require a fee of $9.00 per ton for criteria pollutants based on actual emissions at major sources. For
facilities which emit hazardous air pollutants (HAPs), the fees are $25, $50 or $100 per ton based on the class of the
pollutant. These fees, when totaled and divided by the total emissions, result in the collection of approximately
$19 per ton for part 70 sources. After careful review, the State determined that these fees would support the title
V permit program costs as required by 40 CFR 70.9(a). The fee demonstration explains that this fee structure allows
program costs to be covered without unduly penalizing any industry in the State, and the fees generated would meet
the program costs. The fee demonstration is detailed and contains direct and indirect costs as well as the cost for
the implementation of enhanced monitoring, and titles III and IV of the Act. The number of resource-hours and positions
needed to implement the program was calculated and the fees were adjusted to meet these costs. The fee regulations
contain a provision requiring an annual review of the program fee schedule and fee regulations, based on the previous
year's costs of permit program operation. The Louisiana fee demonstration shows that this fee schedule meets the
requirements for an operating permits program in Louisiana. The State will collect $11,000,000 per year to support
all applicable part 70 activities. Total costs to administer the operating permits program are projected to be $10.6
million per year. The State will also increase State air quality staff by 14 positions. Any changes in the fees would
need to be made by a revision to the fee regulations.

4. Provisions Implementing the Requirements of Other Titles of the Act 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The State of Louisiana acknowledges that its request for approval of a part 70 program is also a request for approval
of a program for delegation of unchanged section 112 standards under the authority of section 112(l) as they apply
to part 70 sources. Upon receiving approval under section 112(l), the State may receive delegation of any new authority
required by section 112 of the Act through the delegation process.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The State also has the option at any time to request, under section 112(l) of the Act, delegation of section 112 requirements
in the form of State regulations which the State demonstrates are equivalent to the corresponding section 112 provisions
promulgated by the EPA. At this time, the State plans to use the mechanism of incorporation by reference to adopt unchanged
Federal section 112 requirements into its regulations. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The radionuclide NESHAP is a section 112 regulation and therefore, also an applicable requirement under the State
operating permits program for part 70 sources. There is not yet a Federal definition of ``major'' for radionuclide
sources. Therefore, until a major source definition for radionuclides is promulgated, no source would be a major
section 112 source solely due to its radionuclide emissions. However, a radionuclide source may, in the interim,
be a major source under part 70 for another reason, thus requiring a part 70 permit. The EPA will work with the State in
the development of its radionuclide program to ensure that permits are issued in a timely manner.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Section 112(g) of the Act requires that, after the effective date of a permits program under title V, no person may construct,
reconstruct or modify any major source of HAPs unless the State determines that the maximum achievable control technology
emission limitation under section 112(g) will be met. Such determination must be made on a case-by-case basis where
no applicable limitations have been established by the Administrator. During the period from the title V effective
date to the date the State has taken appropriate action to implement the final section 112(g) rule (either adoption
of the unchanged Federal rule or approval of an existing State rule under 112(l)), Louisiana intends to implement
section 112(g) of the Act through the State's preconstruction process.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The State of Louisiana commits to appropriately implementing and enforcing the existing and future requirements
of sections 111, 112 and 129 of the Act, and all maximum achievable control technology (MACT) standards promulgated
in the future, in a timely manner. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The State of Louisiana developed acid rain permit rules as AQ#70 section 505, which was submitted with the operating
permits program package. The State also submitted standard acid rain permit application forms. These forms will
be revised as updated model forms are provided by the EPA. These rules and permit applications meet the requirements
of the acid rain program.

5. Enforcement Provisions 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Louisiana's operating permits program submittal addressed the enforcement requirements of 40 CFR 70.4(b)(4)(ii)
and 70.4(b)(5) in Volume I which included a signed Memorandum of Understanding between EPA Region 6 and LDEQ. 30 L.R.S.
section 2025.F.1 allows for injunctive relief for violations that are emissions-related, and 30 L.R.S. section
2025.F.2 allows for criminal penalties for violations of emissions limitations, fee and filing requirements, tampering
with a monitoring device, and false statements. 30 L.R.S. section 2025.F.2.c provides that a person shall not be considered
to be in willful or knowing violation of a fee or filing requirement that was not complied with through excusable neglect.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Louisiana Attorney General's Opinion has demonstrated that the State's enforcement authority is adequate under
the requirements of 40 CFR part 70, as discussed above.

6. Summary
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The State of Louisiana submitted to the EPA, under a cover letter from the Governor dated November 15, 1993, the State's
operating permits program. The submittal has been reviewed for adequacy under the requirements of 40 CFR part 70.
The results of this review are included in the technical support document. The submittal has adequately addressed
all sixteen (16) elements required for full approval as discussed in part 70, except with regard to the 70.4(b)(16)
requirement to include requirements for all permit conditions in the permit regulations, the requirement that a
permit, or any portion of a permit, may not be held confidential, the requirement that the permit regulations ensure
that no source, or portion of a source which would be defined as major under 40 CFR 70.2 will be exempted from part 70 requirements
because an R &amp; D facility is co-located with a manufacturing facility, the requirement that AQ#70 section 521.A.6
ensure that ``off-permit'' changes are not processed as administrative amendments, the requirement for approval
by the Administrator for any changes similar to those allowed by AQ#70 section 521.A to be processed as administrative
amendments, the requirement that AQ#70 section 527.A.3 be clarified as referring to ``off-permit'' changes, the
requirement that AQ#70 section 507.C.1.b be revised to require that affected sources comply with the deadlines in
AQ#70 section 505.D.2, and the requirement that records be kept for five years, as discussed above. According to EPA's
current interpretation of ``title I modification'' and ``case-by-case determination,'' the Louisiana operating
permits program would also need to be revised for full approval consistent with the Federal interpretation, by making
the definition of ``title I modification'' consistent with the Federal definition, and by requiring that changes
to ``case-by-case'' emission limitation determinations and source-specific control technologies among other
changes must be processed as significant modifications as required by 40 CFR 70.7(e)(2)(i)(3). However, if, as discussed
above, 40 CFR part 70 is revised to adopt the alternative interpretation of ``title I modification'' and ``case-by-case
determination,'' Louisiana's regulation with regard to these issues would be fully consistent with 40 CFR part 70
without change. Louisiana's operating permits program submittal meets all requirements necessary to receive source
category-limited interim approval of the State operating permits program pursuant to title V, 1990 Amendments and
40 CFR part 70.

B. Options for Approval/Disapproval and Implications 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The EPA is proposing to grant interim approval to the operating permits program submitted by Louisiana on November
15, 1993. Interim approvals under section 502(g) of the Act do not create any new requirements, but simply approve
requirements that the State is already imposing. As discussed above, the State's regulation regarding R &amp; D facilities
causes the State to lack the authority to ensure that all part 70 sources submit an application in the first year following
interim approval. Therefore, Louisiana will be granted source category-limited interim approval. In order to receive
source category-limited interim approval, Louisiana's operating permits program must substantially meet the
part 70 requirements and demonstrate a compelling reason. The EPA is satisfied that these requirements have been
met. If promulgated, the State must make the changes noted above to receive full approval. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Evidence of these statutory and regulatory revisions and their procedurally correct adoption must be submitted
to the EPA within 18 months of the EPA's approval of the Louisiana operating permits program. This interim approval,
which may not be renewed, extends for a period of up to two years. During the interim approval period, the State is protected
from sanctions for failure to have a program, and the EPA is not obligated to promulgate a Federal permits program in
the State. Permits issued under a program with interim approval would have full standing with respect to part 70, and
the one-year time period for submittal of permit applications by subject sources begins upon interim approval, as
does the three-year time period for processing the initial permit applications.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
If the interim approval is converted to a disapproval, it will not affect any existing State requirements applicable
to small entities. Federal disapproval of the State submittal would not affect its State-enforceability. Moreover,
the EPA's disapproval of the submittal would not impose a new Federal requirement.

III. Proposed Rulemaking Action 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
In this action, the EPA is proposing interim approval of the operating permits program submitted by the State of Louisiana.
The program was submitted by the State to the EPA for the purpose of complying with Federal requirements found in title
V of the Act, and in 40 CFR part 70, which mandate that States develop, and submit to the EPA, programs for issuing operating
permits to all major stationary sources, and to certain other sources with the exception of Indian Lands. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Requirements for title V approval, specified in 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
40 CFR 70.4(b), encompass section 112(l)(5) requirements for approval of a program for delegation of Federal section
112 standards as they apply to part 70 sources. Section 112(l)(5) requires that the State's program contain adequate
authorities, adequate resources for implementation, and an expeditious compliance schedule, which are also requirements
under 40 CFR part 70. Therefore, as part of this interim approval, the EPA is also proposing to grant approval under
section 112(l)(5) and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
40 CFR 63.91 of the State's program for receiving delegation of section 112 standards that are unchanged from Federal
standards as promulgated. This applies to existing and future standards as they apply to sources covered by the part
70 program.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The EPA has reviewed this submittal of the Louisiana operating permits program and is proposing source category-limited
interim approval. Certain defects in the State's statutes and regulations preclude the EPA from granting full approval
of the State's operating permits program at this time. The EPA is proposing to grant interim approval, subject to the
State obtaining the needed regulatory and statutory revisions within 18 months after the Administrator's approval
of the Louisiana title V program pursuant to 40 CFR 70.4.

C. Regulatory Flexibility Act 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Under the Regulatory Flexibility Act, 5 U.S.C. 600, et seq, the EPA must prepare a regulatory flexibility analysis
assessing the impact of any proposed or final rule on small entities (5 U.S.C. 603 and 604). Alternatively, the EPA
may certify that the rule will not have a significant impact on a substantial number of small entities. Small entities
include small businesses, small not-for-profit enterprises, and government entities with jurisdiction over populations
of less than 50,000.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Operating permits program approvals under section 502 of the Act do not create any new requirements, but simply approve
requirements that the State is already imposing. Therefore, because the Federal operating permits program approval
does not impose any new requirements, I certify that it does not have a significant impact on any small entities affected.
Moreover, due to the nature of the Federal-State relationship under the Act, preparation of a regulatory flexibility
analysis would constitute Federal inquiry into the economic reasonableness of State action. The Act forbids the
EPA to base its actions concerning operating permits programs on such grounds (
