India: U.S."] 
  [Text] Washington, Feb. 1--In a wide-ranging critique of 
the Indian law and order agencies, the U.S. State Department has 
said that "despite extensive constitutional and statutory 
safeguards, significant human rights abuses persist throughout 
India." The severe charges against India are part of the 
department's annual survey of human rights record of the 
governments worldwide, that was released here today. 
  The human rights abuses in India are "aggravated by severe 
social tensions and the authorities' attempts to contain violent 
secessionist movements," says the State Department. The abuses 
are particularly acute in disturbed areas such as Punjab and 
Kashmir, "where the judicial system has broken down in the face 
of terrorist threats." 
  Areas of abuse: The areas of abuse in India listed 
by the State Department is long and includes extra-judicial and 
reprisal killings by security forces in Kashmir, Punjab and the 
Northeast, political killings, kidnapping and extortion by 
militants, torture, rape and death in custody all over India, 
detention for prolonged periods without charges, inadequate 
prosecution of implicated personnel from the police and security 
forces, inter-caste and communal violence, legal discrimination 
and social violence against women, lax prosecution of dowry 
deaths and widespread exploitation of indentured, bonded and 
child labour. 
  The State Department has been presenting these annual 
reports 
on human rights violations to the U.S. Congress since 1977. The 
U.S. Congress has been demanding that the country's foreign and 
trade policies take into account the performance of various 
countries on human rights and workers' rights. 
  Six sections: The reporting on each country is 
divided into six sections: respect for human rights, respect for 
civil liberties, practice of political rights, attitude to human 
rights activists, social discrimination and workers rights. 
Almost half of the report on India is devoted to the first 
section on violation of human rights, particularly in Punjab and 
Kashmir. 
  Although the militant groups come for some criticism, the 
fire of the State Department is reserved mostly for the Indian 
police and security forces. It is sharply critical of a number 
of the Indian legal instruments such as the Terrorist and 
Disruptive Activities (Prevention) Act and the National Security 
Act, the conditions in Indian prisons, and the general 
functioning of the police and judicial system in dealing with 
militants. 
  Only modest results: The State Department notes 
that New Delhi has begun to address the international concerns 
on human rights violations in India by creating the Human Rights 
Commission and entering into a dialogue with international human 
rights groups. But it suggests that "these efforts have produced 
only modest results." 
  It notes the "Indian Government's claim that 146 security 
force personnel had been disciplined for acts of omission and 
commission during the operations in Kashmir over the past three 
years. Since the Indian Government did not publicise the forms 
of punishment or the crimes involved," it was impossible to 
judge the adequacy of the punishment." 
  It also notes that among the Kashmiris, "there is a general 
impression that official abuse goes unpunished." On New Delhi's 
relation to human rights activists in the country, the State 
Department says that despite the generally tolerant attitude, 
"human rights monitors have been targeted by the police for 
arrest and harassment." 
  T.N. Govt. flayed: On civil liberties, the State 
Department notes the Constitutional protection of freedom of 
speech and the press in India. It recognises the vigorous press 
in India but cites instances of harassment by the Government. It 
is critical of the Tamil Nadu Government for putting pressure on 
the opposition press and using "defamation charges in the courts 
to intimidate editors and journalists." 
  On freedom of religion, the State Department refers to the 
freedom of worship in India and notes the growing challenges to 
the secular foundation of the Indian State. It is sharply 
critical of the role of the Bombay police during the communal 
riots in that city during early 1993. 
  On discrimination against women, the State Department notes 
that despite an elaborate system of laws, "deeply rooted 
traditions lead to lax and some times no enforcement of these 
laws, especially in rural areas." On trade union rights, the 
survey reports the general respect for the right to organise, 
but comments that "as with other peripheral groups in Indian 
society, unaffiliated unions of low caste or tribal workers 
cannot always avail themselves of protections and rights 
guaranteed by law." 
  The survey notes that the eradication of bonded labour in 
India is only "proceeding slowly." It also says that the legal 
provisions in India have had little impact on the use of child 
labour.
