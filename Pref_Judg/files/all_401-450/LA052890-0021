Press International; Drawing, Taking Telescopes Aloft -- The space shuttle 
Columbia will carry the Astro Observatory, which consists of three ultraviolet 
telescopes and one X-ray telescope mounted in the payload bay. The ultraviolet 
telescopes are operated by the astronauts from the aft deck inside the shuttle, 
while the x-ray instrument is operated remotely from the ground. The telescope 
view the universe at wavelenghts normally absorbed by the Earth's atmosphere, 
and thus should provide a new picture of astronomical objects. SANDY KAY / Los
