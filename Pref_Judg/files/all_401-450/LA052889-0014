"Bride of the Re-Animator" -- the sequel to the cult pic, "Re-Animator," about 
the bizarre experiments of med student Herbert West -- begins shooting in and 
around L.A. in June. Producer/director Brian Yuzna is casting, but Jeffrey 
Combs (who played West in the original) is as yet unsigned.

The sequel finds West attempting to "revive" his late girlfriend. Like "I," 
said Yuzna, "it will have a satirical bent."

A casting notice sure does. Consider: "(The bride is) a patchwork quilt of old 
body parts . . . (but) she goes to pieces when he rejects her." And for West: 
"Totally and irrevocably bonkers."

The casting call for performers to portray the re-animated corpses requires one 
to have . . . dance experience. Pat H. Broeske
