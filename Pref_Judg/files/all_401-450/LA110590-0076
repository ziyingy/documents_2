The Hubble Space Telescope has made its first observation of the chemical 
makeup of a distant quasar that may yield clues to the makeup of the early 
universe, NASA officials said Sunday.

Using the telescope's Faint Object Spectrograph, astronomers from the National 
Aeronautics and Space Administration, Johns Hopkins University in Baltimore and 
UC San Diego observed the spectrum of a faint quasar, called UM675, about 12 
billion light years from Earth.

(A light year is the distance light travels in one year, or about 186,000 
miles.)

Quasars, the brightest objects in the universe, emit energy that seems too 
intense to come from a source so compact. Although quasars were discovered in 
1963, scientists still understand little about them.

E. Margaret Burbidge, the UC San Diego astronomer who led the team, said that 
one purpose of the eight-hour observation was to look for the "signature" of 
helium in the far ultraviolet spectrum. 
</P>
<P>
The strength of that helium signature, after analysis, should reveal something 
about how much helium existed in the early universe, Burbidge said. 
</P>
<P>
Helium is the second most abundant element in the universe, but scientists say 
that not all of it could have come from the stars' nuclear fusion, which 
transforms hydrogen to helium. So it has been theorized that most of the helium 
came from the "big bang" explosion that some astronomers think created the 
universe about 15 billion years ago. 
</P>
<P>
The part of a quasar's radiation that includes the main spectral lines produced 
by helium cannot be picked up by a ground-based telescope because it is blocked 
by Earth's ozone layer.
