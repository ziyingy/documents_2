  [Text] Rangoon, June 7 (AFP) -- Burma alleges that Western 
nations are deliberately distorting its drug production figures 
as part of their drive to put pressure on the government for 
political change. 
  Burmese officials said that the West, and particularly the 
United States, intentionally inflated the annual drug yield in 
Burma while refusing to recognize Rangoon's efforts at 
combatting the problem. 
  In a veiled reference to pro-democracy activist Aung San Suu 
Kyi, now in her fifth year of house arrest, Colonel Kyaw Win, 
deputy director of defense services intelligence, said: "As far 
as this factor exists, we will be over-assessed." 
  "Whatever we do, the West will downplay us," he said. 
  He and other officials interviewed over the past week never 
mentioned the country's leading dissident by name, but instead 
referred to Aung San Suu Kyi most frequently as "the factor," or 
occasionally as "the lady." 
  In conversations with AFP, officials also complained that 
warlord Khun Sa, who has been battling Rangoon government troops 
for autonomy in the Shan state, was being portrayed by some as a 
freedom fighter. 
  "He is a drug runner, and we take him as that," Kyaw Win 
said, adding there would be no peace talks with Khun Sa. 
  Officials pointed to crop substitution programs begun in 
border areas where Rangoon has signed peace agreements with a 
majority of the armed rebel groups who formerly fought the 
central government. 
  U.S. Drug Enforcement Administration agents were given 
access 
to these areas for assessment, Kyaw Win said, but there was a 
high disparity" between their field reports and the figures 
eventually published in Washington. 
  U.S. officials had no immediate comment. Western drug agency 
sources dismissed the charge, but one Western diplomat remarked 
that the allegation was "not impossible." 
  Western nations have assessed Burma's annual production of 
illicit opium, mainly in border areas forming part of the Golden 
Triangle, at around 2,500 tonnes--a figure which Rangoon 
officials said was exaggerated. 
  Rangoon has, meanwhile, denied reports of major battles with 
Khun Sa's Maung Tai Army (MTA) in the Shan state, describing the 
fighting as only localized operations. 
  Asked about Khun Sa's claims of heavy losses by government 
troops, Kyaw Win acknowledged there were casualties, but "not as 
much as Khun Sa says." 
  A Rangoon-based diplomat concurred, saying casualties were 
running three-to-one, with Khun Sa's attacking forces suffering 
more than government troops operating from defensive positions. 
  Once the remaining Karen, Mon and Karenni rebel groups had 
signed peace agreements with Rangoon, Kyaw Win said, "we will go 
all out against Khun Sa." 
  He and other officials declined to say when such agreements 
might be concluded, but indicated that contacts were continuing. 
  Diplomats and other observers said they saw little prospect, 
however, for an early agreement with the Karen, who are believed 
to have the strongest rebel fighting force still in action 
against the government.
