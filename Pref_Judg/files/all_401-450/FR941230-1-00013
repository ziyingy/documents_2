I. Background of regulations
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Section 103 provides generally that interest on certain States or local bonds (
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
tax-exempt bonds
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
) is excluded from gross income. Section 103(b)(1) provides, however, that private activity bonds (other than qualified
bonds) are not tax-exempt bonds. Section 141 provides that a bond is a private activity bond if the issue of which the
bond is a part satisfies either the private business tests or the private loan financing test. The private business
tests of section 141(b) are satisfied if the issue satisfies both the private business use test, which relates to the
use of the bond proceeds, and the private security or payment test, which relates to the manner in which the issue is
secured or will be repaid. Section 141(c) provides that the private loan financing test is satisfied if the lesser
of $5 million or 5 percent of the proceeds of an issue are to be used to make or finance loans to persons other than governmental
units.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Regulations relating to the private business tests under section 103(b) of the Internal Revenue Code of 1954 (the

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
1954 Code
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
), the predecessor to section 141(b), are contained in &sect;1.103&hyph;7 (the 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
industrial development bond regulations
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
.) These regulations have not been amended since their finalization shortly after the enactment of section 103(b)
of the 1954 Code. Since 1972 many changes have occurred in the financing practices of State and local governments.
In addition, the 1984 Act and the 1986 Act made a number of significant changes to the private business tests. These
changes include reductions in the permissible amounts of private business use and private security or payments,
new limitations for certain types of bonds (for example, issues for output facilities), and modifications to the
private business use and private security or payment tests. Importantly, however, the 1986 Act legislative history
states that, to the extent not amended, principles of prior law continue to apply. The industrial development bond
regulations have not been amended to reflect the changes to the private business tests made in the 1984 Act or the 1986
Act. Finally, the industrial development bond regulations do not provide guidance on the private loan financing
test.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
This document proposes to amend the Income Tax Regulations (26 CFR part 1) by replacing the industrial development
bond regulations under &sect;1.103&hyph;7 with comprehensive regulations addressing the private business tests
and the private loan financing test. This document also contains proposed regulations that would replace other guidance
found in various pronouncements of the Service (for example, Notice 87&hyph;69, 1987&hyph;2 C.B. 378, Notice 89&hyph;9,
1989&hyph;1 C.B. 630, Rev. Proc. 93&hyph;17, 1993&hyph;1 C.B. 507, and Rev. Proc. 93&hyph;19, 1993&hyph;1 C.B.
526). This document also proposes certain related rules in the Income Tax Regulations, including rules for qualified
bonds under section 141(e), qualified 501(c)(3) bonds under section 145, arbitrage allocation rules under &sect;1.148&hyph;6,
definitions in &sect;1.150&hyph;1, changes in use under section 150 (b) and (c), and enterprises zone facility bonds
under section 1394. In the process developing the proposed regulations, the Internal Revenue Service and Treasury
considered the public comments received with respect to the industrial development bond regulations and other existing
guidance.

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The proposed regulations substantially revise the industrial development bond regulations to provide more comprehensive
guidance, including numerous examples. Further, in contrast to the industrial development bond regulations, the
rules and definitions in the proposed regulations, the rules and definitions in the proposed regulations are coordinated
with the rules in the arbitage regulations under section 148 and the rules in section 150 that apply generally for tax-exempt
bond purposes.

In general.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The proposed regulations generally provide a number of definitions that apply for all purposes of section 141. Further,
for many terms, the definitions that apply for arbitrage purposes are made applicable for purposes of section 141.
Selected definitions are discussed below.
