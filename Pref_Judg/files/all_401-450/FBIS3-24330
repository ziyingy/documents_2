<F P=106> [Article by Anda Mikelsone: "Two People Were Murdered Each </F>
Day Last Year"] 
  [Text] Riga, 17 February--According to the unverified data 
of the Ministry of Welfare's Health Department, the death rate 
in Latvia last year was much higher than it had been in 1992 
(3,787 more deaths last year than in 1992), and so was the 
number of suicides and murders. There was an average of two 
murders and three suicides each day last year. Brigita Everse, 
the head of the Public Health Statistics Division of the 
Ministry of Welfare's Health Department, told DIYENA today that 
the total number of murder victims last year was 639, which was 
215 more than in the previous year. The number of suicides rose 
by 171 (a total of 1,090 suicides). 
  The number of accidental deaths, including homicides and 
suicides, increased by exactly 1,000. Last year there were 5,485 
accidental deaths. 
  Meanwhile, the birth rate is declining. The number of 
children born in 1993 was 4,246 less than in 1992. In all, 
27,323 children were born last year (not counting stillbirths). 
  Psychologist Janis Gulbis says this is a result of the 
dramatically lower standard of living. In his opinion, 85 
percent of the Latvian population is living on less than the 
minimum subsistence budget. There are many cases in which people 
have nothing to eat for a long time, and this is driving them to 
suicide and crime. 
  People are much less likely to seek medical treatment than 
before. Because of this, their illnesses are often neglected 
until they are severe enough to be fatal. Besides this, medicine 
and medical treatment are too expensive now.
