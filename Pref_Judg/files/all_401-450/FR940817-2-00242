The validity of a given neurotoxicity test relies on evidence that it adequately 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
measures the domain of interest and is not highly correlated with tests that are believed to 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
measure unrelated functions. These convergent and divergent aspects of validity are 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
frequently divided into construct, content, and criterion subcategories. Construct validity 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
refers to the ability of a given test to measure the intended function or construct (e.g., 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
attention), content to how well the test measures the major aspects of the function, and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
criterion to how highly the test correlates with other tests of the same function or predicts 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
neurotoxic impairment after similar insult. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Many neurobehavioral tests purport to measure the same or similar cognitive, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
sensory, or motor functions, but correlations between these tests under chemical exposure or 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
control conditions can be disappointingly low. This is not surprising given the procedural 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
differences that exist among neurobehavioral tests. Tests intended to measure the same 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
function often have different presentation and response modalities (visual, verbal, manual), 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
have differing numbers of trials or a different time limit, and have different methods for 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
scoring the results. Many tests have such large procedural differences that direct comparison 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
is difficult. Assessment of validity for neurobehavioral tests of specific constructs, such as 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
attention, is further complicated in that sensory input, other cognitive processes, and motor 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
responses are unavoidable contributors to the test result.

3.6.1.4. Dose response. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Dose in this discussion refers to the measurement of chemical or 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
metabolite concentrations in the body and to estimations of exposure. Both exposure 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
assessment and biologic concentrations should be measured whenever possible. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Dose-response relationships have been observed both in field and laboratory studies. Two 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
recent human solvent exposure studies used lower exposure concentration that resulted in 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
mucosal membrane effects reported by subjects as odors or irritation (Dick et al., 1992; 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Hjelm et al., 1990). Neurobehavioral impairment was not detected in these studies. A 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
review of over 50 organic solvent human exposure experiments found that neurobehavioral 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
impairment generally occurred at mean concentrations higher than those associated with 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
irritation, although there was often overlap among the irritant and impairment concentration 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
ranges (Dick, 1988). Defining neurotoxic dose-response relationships in humans decreases 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the uncertainties of extrapolation from animal data and allows a more accurate risk 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
assessment. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Recent human solvent exposure studies have employed low concentrations under 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
which neurobehavioral impairment was not observed. Rather, these studies have primarily 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
detected the effects of solvents on mucosal membranes reported by subjects as odors or 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
irritation (Dick, unpublished observation). While these data may be relevant to setting 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
workplace and environmental exposure limits, they can be expected to provide little 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
information about the neurobehavioral impairment that occurs at higher concentrations. The 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
relationship between irritant/odor concentration-effect functions and neurobehavioral 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
impairment concentration-effect functions is not known, but it is probably not linear. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Dose-dependent mechanisms of toxic effect can be expected to complicate risk extrapolation 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
across the dose-response range in humans. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
A further complication in dose-response extrapolation is that low concentrations of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
chemicals may appear to improve performance as measured by neurobehavioral tests, while 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
higher doses are more likely to impair performance. Improved performance does not 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
necessarily indicate the absence of neurotoxicity; both increases and decreases in 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
neurobehavioral performance may result from deleterious chemical interactions with neurons. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Dose-response extrapolation is further complicated by the observation that facilitative or 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
impairment effects within a given dosage range may occur at some parameters of the test 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
stimulus or aspects of the response (response rate-dependent) but not at others (Altmann et 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
al., 1991). Therefore, dose extrapolations are more difficult when there is uncertainty about 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the shape of the dose-response function (biphasic, linear, etc.) at the relevant test stimulus 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
and response parameters. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The risk assessment process with animal data involves extrapolation from the effects 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
of high doses in animals to predict the effects of chronic low-dose exposure in humans. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
With data from laboratory studies of humans in a risk assessment, however, the extrapolation 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
is in the other direction, from very low-dose laboratory exposure to predict the effects of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
chronic exposure at higher (but still low) concentrations in the environment and workplace. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Low- to high-dose extrapolation within the same species may require different assumptions 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
and risk assessment procedures. Although high-dose human exposures have occurred in 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
accidents, those data are primarily descriptive in nature and cannot easily be plugged into a 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
quantitative risk extrapolation process. Low dose laboratory data may be combined with data 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
from epidemiologic studies of persons exposed to higher concentrations.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Structure-activity relationships for well-known chemicals have 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
largely been established by clinical methods (and animal studies) and verified by 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
neurobehavioral and neurophysiologic testing. Although an area of active research, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
neurobehavioral testing of humans has not yet been able to identify reliable patterns of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
impairment among chemical classes. This endeavor has been hampered by most laboratory 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
research having been limited to the evaluation of low concentrations of solvents and a few 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
other reversible toxicants and by the exposure uncertainties, biases, and confounding 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
variables found in cross-sectional or cohort field studies.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Uncovering behavioral and neurophysiologic mechanisms 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
of action is a potential contribution of human laboratory exposure studies to neurotoxicity 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
risk assessment. For example, Stewart et al. (1972) demonstrated that methylene chloride 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
was metabolized to carbon monoxide in humans, and further studies (Putz et al., 1979) found 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
that CO production could account for some of the neurobehavioral impairment observed with 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
that chemical. Recent human laboratory studies of solvents employed low concentrations that 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
produced mucosal irritation and strong odor, but little neurobehavioral impairment (Dick, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
unpublished observation). The mechanisms of action that produce mucosal irritation and the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
neurotoxic mechanisms that are expressed in neurobehavioral impairment may be quite 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
different. Data on mucosal irritation and odor may therefore provide limited information for 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
a neurotoxicity risk assessment.

3.6.2.2. Exposure duration 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
A criticism of extrapolation from animal studies to human 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
exposure conditions is that the effects of short-term exposure (months to 1&hyph;2 years) in 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
animals may not accurately predict the effects of chronic exposure (
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=6 f=1 -->
&gt;
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
10 years) in humans. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Laboratory studies rarely expose human subjects to solvents for more than 4&hyph;6 hours per day 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
for 2&hyph;5 days while environmental and workplace exposures of concern involve 6&hyph;8 hours of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
exposure per day for years. The uncertainties of extrapolating from relatively acute 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
exposures to predict the risks from chronic exposure will not be eliminated by using human 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
laboratory exposure data in risk assessment.

3.6.2.3. Time-dependent effects 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The acute exposures that are possible in human laboratory 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
studies may provide little information on chronic time-dependent neurobehavioral effects. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The effects of initial exposure may remain the same, decrease (tolerance), or increase 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(sensitization) with continued or repeated exposure to the chemical. All effects will not 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
change in unison; tolerance and sensitization may be observed simultaneously on different 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
measures of neurobehavioral function. The multiple toxicodynamic effects of chemical 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
exposure (neurobehavioral and other) seem to follow individual time courses suggestive of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
multiple mechanisms of action. In addition, the processes of tolerance and sensitization can 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
be influenced by testing conditions and the nature of the behavioral task. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
One also must be concerned about latent effects that do not appear for some time after 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
a brief exposure and ``silent'' cumulative neurotoxic effects that are not observable in acute 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
human studies. Latent and silent effects not only bring up the possibility of unknown risks 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
for human subjects, but also make more difficult the extrapolation of chronic neurotoxic risks 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
on the basis of acute exposures.
