SUMMARY:
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
 We are allowing a number of previously prohibited fruits and vegetables to be imported into the United States from
certain parts of the world. All of the fruits and vegetables, as a condition of entry, will be subject to inspection,
disinfection, or both, at the port of first arrival as may be required by a U.S. Department of Agriculture inspector.
In addition, some of the fruits and vegetables will be required to undergo prescribed treatments for fruit flies or
other injurious insects as a condition of entry, or to meet other special conditions. This action will provide the
United States with additional kinds and sources of fruits and vegetables while continuing to provide protection
against the introduction and dissemination of injurious plant pests by imported fruits and vegetables. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
We are also making several minor changes to the regulations for the sake of clarity.

Background 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The regulations in 7 CFR 319.56 through 319.56&hyph;8 (referred to below as the regulations) prohibit or restrict
the importation of fruits and vegetables into the United States from certain parts of the world to prevent the introduction
and dissemination of injurious insects that are new to or not widely distributed within and throughout the United
States. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
On May 2, 1994, we published in the 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 -->
Federal Register
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 (59 FR 22538&hyph;22545, Docket No. 93&hyph;101&hyph;1) a document in which we proposed to amend the regulations
to allow additional fruits and vegetables to be imported into the United States from certain parts of the world under
specified conditions. The importation of those fruits and vegetables had been prohibited because of the risk that
the fruits and vegetables could introduce injurious insects into the United States. We proposed to allow those importations
at the request of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
various importers and foreign ministries of agriculture and after 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
determining that the fruits or vegetables could be imported under certain 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
conditions with insignificant pest risk. Also in the proposed rule, we 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
proposed to make some minor changes to the regulations for the sake 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
of clarity. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
We solicited comments on the proposed rule for a 30-day period ending on 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
June 1, 1994. We received 50 comments by that date. One comment, from a State agricultural agency, supported the proposal.
The other 49 comments, from fruit growers and distributors, State agricultural agencies, fruit 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
growers' cooperative associations, and trade associations, opposed the proposal or some of its provisions and/or
made recommendations. We carefully considered all of the comments we received. They are discussed below.

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Comment:
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 The treatments and other requirements proposed by the Animal and Plant Health Inspection Service (APHIS) for the
various fruits and vegetables to be imported would be inadequate in preventing the introduction of exotic pests into
the United States. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
 Response:
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 Prior to proposing that various fruits and vegetables be allowed into the United States, APHIS researches the pests,
including diseases, afflicting those fruits and vegetables in their countries of origin. After reviewing the results
of the research on the fruits and vegetables in this proposal, we are confident that the treatments and other requirements
proposed as conditions of entry into the United States will be adequate to prevent the introduction of exotic plant
pests.

Comment:
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 APHIS is proposing to use methyl bromide as a fumigant in the treatment of imported fruits and vegetables even though
the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA), in a final rulemaking published in the 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 -->
Federal Register
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 on December 10, 1993 (58 FR 65018&hyph;65082), has frozen methyl bromide production at 1991 levels and required the
phasing out of domestic use of methyl bromide by the year 2001. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Response:
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 APHIS is aware of the EPA rulemaking on the use of methyl bromide. APHIS is studying the effectiveness and environmental
acceptability of alternative treatments to prepare for the eventual unavailability of methyl bromide fumigation.
Our current proposal, however, assumes the continued availability of methyl bromide for use as a fumigant for at least
the next few years.
