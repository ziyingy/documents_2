facilities at which the only hazardous wastes that are managed are today's proposed wastes in units subject to permit
requirements when these listings are finalized) must qualify for interim status within six months of publication
of the rule in order to continue managing these wastes in such units. To retain interim status, a newly-regulated land
disposal facility must submit a part B permit application within eighteen months after publication of the rule and
certify that the facility is in compliance with all applicable ground-water monitoring and financial responsibility
requirements (see RCRA Section 3005(e)(3)).

Interim status facilities that manage today's proposed wastes after these listings are promulgated, must file an
amended Part A permit application within six months of publication of the final rule if they are to continue managing
these wastes in units that require a permit. The facilities must file the necessary amendments by the effective date
of the rule, or they will not retain interim status with respect to today's proposed wastes. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Currently permitted facilities that manage today's proposed wastes after their listings are finalized by EPA must
request permit modifications if they are to continue management of these wastes in units that require a permit. Since
EPA initially will be responsible for processing these permit modifications, the new Federal procedures for permit
modifications will be followed (see 53 FR 37934, September 28, 1988). These new procedures contain a specific provision
for newly listed or identified wastes (see 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
40 CFR 270.42(g)). This provision generally requires that a permitted facility that is ``in existence'' for the newly
listed or identified waste on the effective date of the waste listing must submit a Class 1 modification by that date.
Essentially, this modification notifies the Agency and the public that the facility is handling the waste and identifies
the units involved. By submitting this notice, the facility temporarily is allowed to continue management of the
newly-listed wastes until the Agency can make a final change to the permit. Next, within 180 days of the effective date
the permittee must submit a more detailed permit modification request (

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->

a Class 2 or 3 modification). This information will be used by the Agency to develop a final permit change. For more information
on permit modifications see the September 28, 1988 preamble discussion referenced above.
