PORTUGAL offered an amnesty to most illegal immigrants yesterday and
announced new measures to tighten up immigration controls, Reuter reports
from Lisbon.
More than 100,000 foreigners reside legally in Portugal, but up to 100,000
more have entered the country illegally, mostly from Portugal's former
African colonies.
Last year Portugal signed the Schengen agreement, which will eventually
abolish immigration controls between eight member states of the European
Community.
Since then, Portugal has been gradually tightening its slack immigration
controls to prevent it becoming a funnel for illegal entry to the Schengen
states from third countries.
Officials engaged in Schengen preparations say their work is necessary to
push the EC's own efforts to create a true 'citizen's Europe', and as a
fallback position should the EC fail to agree on crucial elements such as
the free movement of citizens between the 12 member states.
A Portuguese cabinet statement said the government would allow illegal
immigrants to legalise their status over the next four months, if they could
prove they had a job or means of support and had lived in Portugal for at
least six months.
But citizens of Portugal's former African colonies, Angola, Mozambique,
Guinea-Bissau, Sao Tome and Principe and Cape Verde, would receive more
favourable treatment, it said.
Portugal would grant residence rights to any citizen of its former colonies
without a criminal record who had lived in the country continuously since
June 1, 1986.
