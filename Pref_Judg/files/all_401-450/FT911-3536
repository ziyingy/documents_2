HOPES of an early end to the US recession have been undermined by an
unexpectedly large drop in new orders for manufactured durable goods. Orders
in March fell 6.2 per cent to the lowest level since August 1987, Peter
Riddell writes from Washington.
The financial markets had been expecting a small rise in new orders
following declines in three of the previous four months. The sharp drop
revived hopes of a possible cut in interest rates and contributed both to a
rise in government bond prices and to a weakening in the dollar.
Mr Alan Greenspan, chairman of the Federal Reserve, yesterday told the
Senate banking committee that current conditions suggested the economy was
'still modestly moving lower,' but at a diminishing rate.
He expected the recession 'to bottom out in a reasonably short period
ahead'.
He said the Fed continued to examine the economy on a 'day-by-day' basis and
the options remained open for interest rate movement. But he warned that the
current rate of inflation was 'more worrisome' than the rate in the summer
of 1986, during a previous economic slowdown.
Significantly, there was weakness across the board in durable goods orders,
affecting nearly all big industries. New orders for non-defence capital
goods equipment, generally regarded as a leading indicator for business
investment, fell by 10.3 per cent in March.
Excluding defence, new orders fell by 5.4 per cent.
Yesterday's report runs contrary to some other recent, more positive
indicators, such as in the housing sector, which suggested that the
recession might be bottoming out and a recovery could start by the late
summer. It raises the question of whether total output, as measured by real
gross national product, will continue to drop in the current period, which
would represent three successive quarters of decline.
Some economists have pointed to a recent rise in stock/inventory levels as
suggesting that any pick-up may be delayed and limited.
