) to implement section 501(c) of Public Law 101&hyph;392. In this connection, it should be noted that these regulations
do not preclude the disregard of educational assistance under any other applicable disregard, e.g., the disregard
of bona fide loans or complementary assistance.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Since the regulatory changes related to section 501(c) of the Carl D. Perkins Vocational and Applied Technology Education
Act do not involve administrative discretion, but simply implement statutory requirements, we believe that, under
5 U.S.C. 553(b)(3)(B), good cause exists for waiver of a notice of proposed rulemaking on the grounds that it is no necessary.

sum of $20,000. If the eligible individual is deceased, the payment will be made to the eligible individual's spouse,

Title II of Public Law 100&hyph;383, the Aleutian and Pribilof Islands Restitution Act, provides that restitution
shall be made to any Aleut living on the date of the enactment of Public Law 100&hyph;383 (August 10, 1988) who, as a civilian,
was relocated by authority of the United States from his or her home village on the Pribilof Islands or the Aleutian

Section 3803(c)(2)(C) of title 31, United States Code, contains a list of various Federal and federally-assisted
programs, including, among others, the AFDC program. However, the list does not include the adult assistance programs
under titles I, X, XIV, and XVI (AABD) of the Social Security Act. Therefore, the disregards required by sections 105(f)(2)
and 206(d)(2) of Public Law 100&hyph;383 do not apply to the adult assistance programs administered in Guam, Puerto
Rico and the Virgin Islands.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Title I of Public Law 100&hyph;707, the Disaster Relief and Emergency Assistance Amendments of 1988, enacted November
23, 1988, amended the Disaster Relief Act of 1974 (42 U.S.C. &sect;&sect;5121&hyph;5202) to provide for more effective
assistance in response to major disasters and emergencies.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Section 105 of Public Law 100&hyph;707 provides that Federal major disaster and emergency assistance provided to
individuals and families under this Act, and comparable disaster assistance provided by States, local governments,
and disaster assistance organizations, shall not be considered as income or resources when determining eligibility
for or benefit levels under federally funded income assistance or resource-tested benefit programs.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Section 103 of Public Law 100&hyph;707 defines an emergency to mean any occasion or instance for which, in the determination
of the President, Federal assistance is needed to supplement State and local efforts and capabilities to save lives
and to protect property and public health and safety, or to lessen or avert the threat of a catastrophe in any part of
the United States.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Section 103 defines a major disaster to mean any natural catastrophe (including any hurricane, tornado, storm, high
water, winddriven water, tidal wave, tsunami, earthquake, volcanic eruption, landslide, mudslide, snowstorm,
or drought), or regardless of cause, any fire, flood, or explosion, in any part of the United States, which in the determination
of the President causes damage of sufficient severity and magnitude to warrant major disaster assistance under the
Disaster Relief Act to supplement the efforts and available resources of States, local governments, and disaster
relief organizations in alleviating the damage, loss, hardship or suffering caused thereby.
