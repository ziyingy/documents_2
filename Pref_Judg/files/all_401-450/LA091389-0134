end of the year.

Japan has been under pressure to ban imports of ivory products to protect 
elephants, which are hunted for their ivory tusks. The United States, Britain, 
France and West Germany have banned ivory imports. Isono said Japan imported 
106 tons of ivory last year, compared with 143 tons in 1987. In 1983, Japan 
imported 475 tons, Isono said.
