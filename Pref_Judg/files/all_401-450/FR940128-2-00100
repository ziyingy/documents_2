The Environmental Protection Agency's (EPA) Innovative Technology Council, comprised of EPA management and staff
from across the Agency, has drafted a strategy to focus and target its efforts to accelerate environmental technology
development, commercialization and use. The Council recognizes a need to accelerate the development, commercialization,
and use of innovative environmental technologies to maintain and improve environmental quality at home and abroad
into the 21st century. Environmental quality would deteriorate, given foreseeable population growth and industrialization,
unless technology is developed and more broadly applied, that is more effective in preventing and reducing pollution
levels, less costly than existing technology and supportive of sustainable development. EPA, state and local agencies
are in a unique position to influence the rate and focus of environmental technology innovation and use because of
their legislative and programmatic mandates and regulatory responsibilities (which often influence the demand
for environmental technologies, goods and services).

In funding the President's Environmental Technology Initiative, the House Committee on Appropriations directed
EPA, ``*&blank;*&blank;* to develop a comprehensive environmental technology strategy characterized by innovation
and a nonbureaucratic approach.''

EPA's draft Strategy provides a plan to directly and indirectly support private sector innovation and diffusion
activities sponsored by the public and private sector and close coordination among Federal agencies. It focuses
on creating incentives for the development and use of innovative technologies in federal and state environmental
regulations, reducing barriers to technology innovation and use, and improving the competitiveness of the environmental
technology industry in domestic and international markets. EPA and other Federal, state and local agencies, universities,
trade associations and consortia, and numerous private companies are already working in many of the areas identified
in the Strategy. EPA is seeking public comment on the Strategy to focus and target efforts to accelerate environmental
technology development, commercialization and use. The Agency's Innovative Technology Council plans to revise
and update the Strategy based on the comments received.

The definition of ``environmental technologies'' being addressed in the Strategy varies widely for a number of reasons.
The ``environmental technology industry'' has only recently become a focal point for market analysts and policy-makers,
and it is highly diversified in terms of the current demand for and supply of technologies, goods and services. Demand
often varies based on local environmental conditions. ``Environmental technologies'' include technologies,
goods, and services whose development is triggered primarily by environmental improvement objectives. Sometimes
referred to as ``dark green'' technologies, these include: products and services to monitor and assess pollutant
releases and exposure levels; innovative technologies which prevent pollution, control air and water pollution
levels, and remediate contaminated soil and groundwater; and, manage environmental data. EPA's Strategy also addresses
``light green'' technologies that are developed primarily for non-environmental reasons; those technologies
can have indirect, but important consequences for improving environmental quality. An example, would be local area
computer networks designed to enhance office communication, but which also reduce paper use.

EPA is interested in promoting all phases of technological change such as: the research and development of new concepts;
preliminary design testing and pilot applications of evolving technologies; performance demonstrations and testing;
evaluations of early commercial applications; and diffusion into domestic and international markets.

The draft ``Technology Innovation Strategy'' outlines the general principles that guide EPA in its efforts to foster
innovation in its existing programs and new projects being initiated under the President's Environmental Technology
Initiative (see below). It outlines four objectives: 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
1. Adapt EPA's policy, regulatory, and compliance framework to promote innovation; 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
2. Strengthen the capacity of technology developers and users to succeed in environmental technology innovation;

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
3. Strategically invest EPA funds in the development and commercialization of promising new technologies; and,

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
4. Accelerate diffusion of innovative technologies at home and abroad. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
EPA invites comments on the draft Strategy and the following questions: 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(1) What roles are appropriate for EPA to play in stimulating the development and use of innovative technological
solutions to environmental problems? 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(2) Do you agree with the Strategy's objectives and with EPA's approaches to achieving them? Which objectives should
receive the highest priority for action? 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(3) Are there additional areas of emphasis that EPA should address in planning and funding its technology development,
commercialization, and diffusion activities? 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(4) Are there particular environmental technology needs or impediments to development on which you feel the Agency
should focus more of its attention?
