  [Text] Moscow May 16 TASS -- Production decline continues 
in the Russian agroindustrial complex. In the first quarter of 
the year the production of major agricultural products dropped 
by 18 per cent over the same period last year, the Ministry of 
Economics told BUSINESS-TASS on Monday. 
  At the same time, the Ministry said that the acreage of 
farmland sowed with crops has increased dramatically this year. 
  As of the beginning of April, farms had 660,000 tonnes of 
diesel fuel and 313,000 tones of gasoline (52 and 61 per cent of 
the last year level respectively). About 300,000 tractors, or 
32 per cent of the total, are out of order. 
  The processing of sugar beat was practically completed in

was produced, a 26,000 tonne decrease since last year. Russian 
sugar refineries produced 235,000 tonnes, or 60 per cent of the

million raw sugar was purchased in Cuba.
