Military pilots who tracked Washington lawyer Thomas Root's plane during its 
bizarre six-hour flight last Thursday saw Root turn his head several times, 
which could cast doubt on his statements that he was unconscious during most of 
the flight, federal investigators announced Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
"Various pilots reported that, as he was intercepted from the right, his head 
would turn to the right, and, as he was intercepted from the left, his head 
would move to the left," National Transportation Safety Board official Andrew 
Alston said. "The sun visor moved position at least three times during the 
flight." 
</P>
<P>
In addition, Alston said, a toxicology report showed no sign of elevated levels 
of carbon monoxide in Root's blood, virtually ruling out an earlier theory that 
he had lost consciousness from carbon monoxide poisoning. And aviation experts 
have discounted the theory that he may have suffered oxygen deprivation at the 
altitude he was flying, 10,000 feet. 
</P>
<P>
Investigators confronted Root Wednesday morning with the conflicts between his 
statements and the evidence, Alston said, but Root offered no explanation. 
</P>
<P>
Root's strange flight focused attention on his business dealings with a Georgia 
firm, Sonrise Management Services Inc., which recruited investors for FM radio 
license applications. Root represented the applicants before the Federal 
Communications Commission. 
</P>
<P>
Few of the applications were successful, and the firm's operations are now 
under investigation by state and federal regulatory officials. 
</P>
<P>
Wednesday, Sonrise shifted blame to Root, filing suit in federal District Court 
here charging that Root had violated his contract with Sonrise to represent 
investors and had improperly handled client funds placed in his law firm's 
escrow account. The suit seeks nearly $600,000 in damages. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
$15 Million Invested 
</P>
<P>
Investors have placed $15 million or more into the partnerships that the 
company organized to seek radio station licenses. To date, efforts by FCC 
officials to obtain information about those dealings have largely been 
unsuccessful. 
</P>
<P>
Root's plane went off course Thursday when he was flying from Washington to 
Rocky Mount, N.C., for a legal proceeding. Military pilots who tracked the 
flight watched the plane for hours as it flew south, with Root slumped back in 
his seat, until the plane apparently ran out of fuel and plunged into the ocean 
14 miles from the Bahamian Island of Eleuthera. 
</P>
<P>
As the plane sank, rescuers were stunned to see Root swim away from the 
wreckage. The oddity of the flight deepened when it was discovered at a 
Hollywood, Fla., hospital to which Root had been taken for treatment that he 
had suffered a gunshot wound in the abdomen. 
</P>
<P>
Police officials said that the gunshot appeared to be self-inflicted, a 
suggestion that Root and his relatives have strenuously denied. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Accidental Firing Discounted 
</P>
<P>
Spokesmen for Smith &amp; Wesson Corp., which manufactured the revolver that 
Root was carrying in his plane, have denied that the impact of the plane's 
hitting the water could have caused the gun to fire, as Root's relatives have 
suggested. 
</P>
<P>
"Any suggestion that our revolver will fire without trigger contact is 
absolutely false," Smith &amp; Wesson Vice President Dick Backman said 
Wednesday. The gun "can be dropped on concrete" and will not go off unless 
someone pulls the trigger, Backman said. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
No Safety Issues Found 
</P>
<P>
With no plans to retrieve the sunken plane and weapon, the mystery of Root's 
flight may not be solved. The NTSB "has not identified any aviation safety 
issues" in Root's flight, a spokeswoman said Wednesday, and is hoping to "wind 
down" its safety investigation. 
</P>
<P>
The FBI will continue to investigate the flight to see if any federal laws were 
broken, but, so far, little evidence of that has emerged. Wednesday, a 
spokesman for William J. Bennett, director of the White House Office of Drug 
Control Policy, denied reports that a federal drug task force had been 
investigating Root. 
</P>
<P>
Laboratory reports on whether Root had drugs or alcohol in his system are 
likely to be released later this week or early next week, the NTSB said.
