An increasing number of people who have not been given asylum in Germany are
reported to be leaving voluntarily so as not to forfeit future chances of
becoming a German resident. Officials in the 16 German states said people
refused asylum were leaving of their own accord instead of waiting for
deportation. Until July last year the German constitution guaranteed an
automatic right of asylum. But faced with an annual influx of 500,000
asylum-seekers, restrictions were introduced. Once deported, people are
forbidden to re-enter Germany for at least 10 years and are not entitled to
any social benefits. Others who leave freely can, in theory, return the next
day and renew their application for asylum. In the first eight months of
this year, 81,864 people applied for asylum, 68.4 per cent fewer than in the
same period the year before.
