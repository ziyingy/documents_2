KEMIRA, the Finnish state-owned chemical group, yesterday reported an 80 per
cent increase in pre-tax losses to FM264m (Dollars 56.6m) in the first eight
months as sales remained static at FM7.1bn.
The company said Finland's prolonged economic recession and weak markets in
other countries were to blame.
In particular, it highlighted continuing pressure on its fertiliser
business, which has been hit by low domestic demand and lower prices in
Europe due to cheap east European imports. It is likely to close two
operations in Finland with the loss of 340 jobs.
The company says it is encouraged by increased demand for titanium dioxide
and a better performance from its chemicals unit. It expects results in the
final four months, helped by a pick-up in Finnish fertiliser sales and a
lower relative depreciation charge, to be better than last year.
The group still says its full-year result will be 'clearly negative' and may
equal last year's FM522m loss. Sales for the whole year are estimated at
FM11bn.
NESTE, the Finnish state-owned oil and petrochemicals group, suffered a loss
of FM914m (Dollars 196m) for the first eight months, its first deficit since
1986.
The result compares with a FM388m profit in the same period in 1991. Sales
rose marginally to FM36.4bn from FM36.1bn.
The group said the downturn in the world economy had an impact on its main
oil refining, petrochemicals and plastics activities.
Neste Oil, the group's largest business area, boosted sales to FM29.7m from
FM29.5m, but profits were hit by lower international refining margins and
inventory losses.
The group's figures were also affected by lower petrochemical and plastics
prices and by the impact of weaker freight rates on its shipping division.
Neste said its operating result was likely to hold steady over the last four
months of the year.
