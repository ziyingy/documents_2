Rain soaked the debris-strewn streets of Charleston, but survivors of the 
coastal city ravaged by Hurricane Hugo banded together to give thanks for life. 
Morris Street Baptist Church, as in many areas of the city, remained without 
power 10 days after Hugo's 135-m.p.h. winds hit, but Sunday school and services 
were held in the natural light from windows. The Rev. Jesse Jackson, a South 
Carolina native, visited the church and met a caravan of trucks with supplies 
from Washington, D.C. Thousands still are without power, and more than 1,000 
people in Charleston and outlying areas sought shelter with the Red Cross. 
Drinking water has been restored to many, but residents were asked to conserve 
water because of sewage problems.
