Astronomers have discovered a tiny, rapidly rotating neutron star that appears 
to be murdering a companion sun in a case of celestial fratricide that promises 
to shed light on stellar evolution and death. The "eclipsing millisecond 
pulsar," the massive remnant of an exploded sun, and its companion white dwarf 
star are located in Terzan 5, a globular star cluster near the center of the 
Milky Way galaxy at a distance of about 24,000 light years.

The newly discovered pulsar, known as PSR 1744-24, and its white dwarf 
companion whirl about each other every 109 minutes at a distance of just 18,600 
miles -- 1/13th the distance from the Earth to the moon -- according to a 
report in the British journal Nature.

The pulsar, about six miles wide, has 1 1/2 times the mass of our sun. The 
white dwarf, a small star in the final stages of its life, is about the size of 
the Earth. The two stars are so close to each other that the pulsar's intense 
radiation is blowing away the atmosphere of the white dwarf so that it will 
eventually dwindle to nothing, researchers said.
