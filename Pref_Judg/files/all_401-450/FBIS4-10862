  [Text] The government policy in the struggle against 
illegal drug trafficking has allowed the Armed Forces and the 
National Police, which are operating under a single command, to 
seize 28,782 kg of drugs such as cocaine base, cocaine 
hydrochloride, and marijuana in a little more than three years. 
During that period these forces captured 12,975 drug traffickers 
and confiscated 415,000 kg of precursors used by the mafia 
"firms" to make drugs. 
  According to Executive Agency for Drug Control (Ofecod) 
statistics, 3,108 drug addicts were arrested nationwide in 1993. 
  Ofecod also reported that in 1991, drug seizures reached 
5,859 kg. In 1992 the amount was 8,800 kg, which included 8,341 
kg of cocaine base, 231.402 kg of cocaine hydrochloride, and 
227.038 kg of marijuana. 
  In 1993, antidrug operations seized 9,461.511 kg of drugs, 
including 8,586.757 kg of cocaine base, 436.727 kg of cocaine 
hydrochloride, and 437.762 kg of marijuana. 
  From January to 24 March 1994, drug seizures reached 
4,532.675 kg of cocaine base, 18.832 kg of cocaine 
hydrochloride, and 110.051 kg of marijuana. 
  The number of drug traffickers arrested in 1991 was 3,664, 
4,195 in 1992, and 5,022 in 1993. In the first three months of 
this year, 94 drug traffickers were arrested. 
  The police operations also allowed the seizure of 105,527 kg 
of precursors in 1991, 185,895 kg in 1992, and 90,288 kg in 
1993, and 33,323 kg in the first three months of this year. 
  According to estimates by the Interior Ministry and the 
Dinandro [National Antidrug Division], the antidrug forces 
confiscated properties, furniture, equipment, and money worth 
about $51.65 million from the "firms" in 1993. 
  The goods include 41 properties in Lima and the provinces 
and 
115 vehicles including cars, trucks, small airplanes, 
speedboats, and motorcycles. 
  Dinandro also reported that 1993 operations against drug 
traffickers in the Upper Huallaga led to the destruction of 41 
labs for processing drugs and 28 maceration pits. 
  From 1 January to 10 March 1994, the police destroyed 12 
labs 
and 11 maceration pits for making cocaine base. It should be 
pointed out that the largest amount of maceration pits, 315, 
were destroyed in 1992.
