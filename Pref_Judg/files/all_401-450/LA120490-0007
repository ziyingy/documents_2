Sixty thousand children are expected to skip school today in the Los Angeles 
Unified School District. If these youngsters routinely miss classes without 
excuse, an attendance counselor will be assigned to look into the chronic 
absenteeism and get the students back into school. These persistent men and 
women perform a tough and admirable service. But 10 attendance counselors may 
lose their jobs next semester, with a lack of funding again the problem. 
</P>

Cutting 10 attendance counselors in February will allow the district to avoid 
spending about $300,000 in salaries and benefits. That is money the district 
simply doesn't have in the wake of its recent -- and deep -- budget cuts. 
</P>

Individual schools paid for these counselors in past years from federal funds 
earmarked to help poor students or from state funds allocated for integration, 
year-round and special improvement programs. When these discretionary funds 
began to run out, the schools were forced to make tough choices, such as using 
district funds to pay for counselors. Reliance on those scarce funds resulted 
in the district cutting 14 counselors before the start of this school year.

The counselors perform a valuable service. They make home visits, often in very 
tough neighborhoods, and tackle what they find. Sick parents, drug-abusing 
mothers and unemployed fathers are persuaded to send their children to school. 
Immigrant parents are taught that their children can attend public schools 
without charge. Youngsters ashamed of their dirty clothes or lack of a hair cut 
are encouraged to do what they can for themselves and let nothing stop them 
from getting an education.

The district also benefits because the state pays roughly $3,035 per child 
based on average daily enrollment. 
</P>
<P>
The 10 counselors who are in jeopardy could get a reprieve. School Supt. Bill 
Anton and some members of the Board of Education, which has the final say on 
the fate of the counselors, are trying to save the positions. 
</P>
<P>
Corporate benefactors should also consider helping out. It surely would be 
cheaper than training undereducated men and women after they are in the labor 
market.
