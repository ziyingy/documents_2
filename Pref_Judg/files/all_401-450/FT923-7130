CAROLCO, the cash-strapped Hollywood studio which is struggling to survive
in spite of its inordinately successful films such as Terminator 2,
yesterday posted a second-quarter net loss of Dollars 14.5m, or 54 cents a
share, against a deficit of Dollars 41m, or Dollars 1.48, a year earlier,
writes Karen Zagor.
Feature film revenues fell to Dollars 39.8m from Dollars 75.6m, largely
because no feature films were released domestically in the latest quarter.
Carolco's total revenues dropped to Dollars 83.5m from Dollars 144.1m.
Carolco's immediate future hinges on the completion of a deal to sell rights
to its film library to Spelling Entertainment for about Dollars 64m. An
earlier agreement with Spelling expired at the beginning of the summer, the
deal but was later revived.
Carolco has reduced its overall debt by about Dollars 108m since the end of
last year
