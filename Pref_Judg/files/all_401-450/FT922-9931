SPAIN HAS warned it will continue to block the EC convention allowing free
movement of people within the Community unless the UK is willing to
negotiate the restoration of Spain's territorial sovereignty over Gibraltar,
writes Tom Burns in Madrid.
The warning, which affects a key element of European single market
legislation, came in the course of talks yesterday between Mr Francisco
Fernandez Ordonez, Spain's foreign minister, and his UK counterpart, Mr
Douglas Hurd.
Under the External Frontiers Convention, which will take effect next year,
Gibraltar would become a Community entry point. Spain views such a
development as undermining its claims over the British colony, which joined
the EC in 1973 as a dependent British territory.
