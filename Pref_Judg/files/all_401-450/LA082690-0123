At low tide, a sand bar peeks out from under the ocean at the mouth of New 
Jersey's Great Bay, the last remnant of an American Atlantis. 
</P>
<P>
Evelyn Suter recalls when that sand bar was a magnificent island, a dreamy sort 
of a place with families and beautiful cedar trees and tales of haunted hotels. 
</P>
<P>
Suter, who turns 83 this month, was one of the children who told those ghost 
stories on Tucker's Island. 
</P>
<P>
And she may be the last person alive who can tell from personal experience the 
story of the island, which was swallowed by the sea more than half a century 
ago. 
</P>
<P>
It's a story with a lesson, a reminder that man may live on the Earth and even 
manipulate it, but, in the end, does not control it. 
</P>
<P>
"It was a wonderful place," Suter said of her childhood home. "But now it's 
gone to the bottom of the Atlantic Ocean." 
</P>
<P>
In its glory years, as far back as the late 1700s, Tucker's Island was 5 miles 
long and a mile wide. It boasted a lighthouse, two hotels and a school and was 
a popular spot for sportsmen and vacationers from Philadelphia. 
</P>
<P>
The island, north of Atlantic City along the New Jersey coast, was named for 
Rueben Tucker, a Quaker from New York who bought it in 1765. According to John 
Bailey Lloyd, a historian who has written about the lost island in two books, 
wealthy Quakers gathered there for religious retreats in the years following 
the American Revolution. 
</P>
<P>
The island was renamed Sea Haven in the 1870s, when there were plans to develop 
it into a major resort. Those plans were shelved when the nearby town of Beach 
Haven, on another island a few miles to the north, proved to be too much 
competition. 
</P>
<P>
Sea Haven's fate as a commercial enterprise was sealed in 1886, when the 
Pennsylvania Railroad ran a line across Barnegat Bay onto Long Beach Island, 
Lloyd said. The tracks ended at Beach Haven and were never extended. 
</P>
<P>
In 1913, when Suter arrived at age 7, the only residents of the once-bustling 
island were a lighthouse keeper, the staff of a lifesaving station and their 
families. The Columbia and St. Alban's hotels had long since closed. 
</P>
<P>
"I remember these two big hotels in disrepair," Suter said. "We kids would say 
they were haunted." 
</P>
<P>
During her first winter there, she lived in a bungalow with her mother and 
father, who worked at the lifesaving station, rescuing shipwrecked sailors. 
</P>
<P>
The family spent a second winter on the island in a houseboat that Suter's 
father towed across the bay from Parkertown. 
</P>
<P>
"We stayed there from September to June," Suter said. "We didn't stay in the 
summer, because there weren't that many shipwrecks. 
</P>
<P>
Suter recalls attending a one-room schoolhouse on the island in 1913 and 1914, 
with about six other children. She has fond memories of walking the desolate 
beaches with her mother, and going fishing in her father's garvey, a small 
scow. 
</P>
<P>
On blustery winter nights, everyone would gather at the lifesaving station, the 
center of the island's social life. 
</P>
<P>
"They had a gramophone and people would sing and dance," she said. "Nowadays, 
people get bored if they don't have a television set. But we had wonderful 
times." 
</P>
<P>
Those times ended in 1915, when the lifesaving station was disbanded and the 
Coast Guard took over Tucker's Island. The family moved back to its house 
across the bay in Parkertown, where Suter had been born and still lives today. 
</P>
<P>
Although no one knew it at the time, the island's days were numbered. On Feb. 
4, 1920, a storm ripped an inlet through Tucker's Beach, a narrow strip of sand 
that formed the tip of Long Beach Island and protected Tucker's Island from the 
fury of the ocean. 
</P>
<P>
Over the next five years, the inlet widened to the south, consuming Tucker's 
Beach and exposing Tucker's Island to the open sea. The relentless ocean began 
chewing up the island and, one by one, its buildings. 
</P>
<P>
In 1927, the Little Egg Harbor Light House, which had stood for nearly a 
century, tumbled into the sea. The ever-encroaching ocean forced the Coast 
Guard to evacuate the island in 1930, according to Lloyd. 
</P>
<P>
Tucker's Island officially ceased to exist in 1932, when Long Beach Township 
removed it from the tax rolls. But a small piece of land where the little 
schoolhouse stood survived until 1938, when it was swept away during a winter 
storm. 
</P>
<P>
Now, only the sand bar is left, and many people Suter meets find it hard to 
believe that so picturesque an island ever stood there. 
</P>
<P>
"People will argue with me about Tucker's Island," she said. "But I always tell 
them, 'I know what it was really like. I lived there.' "
