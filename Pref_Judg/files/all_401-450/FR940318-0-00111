The stratospheric ozone layer protects the earth from dangerous ultraviolet-B (UV&hyph;B) 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
radiation. Depletion of stratospheric ozone allows more UV&hyph;B radiation to penetrate to the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
earth's surface. Increased radiation, in turn, has been linked to higher incidence of certain 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
skin cancers and cataracts, suppression of the human immune system, damage to crops and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
aquatic organisms, and increased formation of ground-level ozone. Further, increased 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
radiation can cause economic losses from materials damage such as more rapid weathering of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
outdoor plastics. (See 53 FR 30566 (August 12, 1988) for more information on the effects of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
ozone depletion.) 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In response to scientific concerns and findings on ozone depletion, the United States 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
and twenty-three other nations signed the Montreal Protocol on Substances that Deplete the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Ozone Layer on September 16, 1987. The original agreement set forth a timetable for 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
reducing the production and consumption of specific ozone-depleting substances, including 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
CFC&hyph;11, CFC&hyph;12, CFC&hyph;113, CFC&hyph;114, CFC&hyph;115, Halon 1211, Halon 1301, and Halon 2402.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
EPA implemented the original Protocol through regulations allocating production and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
consumption allowances equal to the total amount of production and consumption granted to 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the United States under the Protocol. (See 53 FR 30566.) 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Parties to the Montreal Protocol met in London June 27&hyph;29, 1990 to consider 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
amendments to the Protocol. In response to scientific evidence indicating greater than 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
expected stratospheric ozone depletion, the Parties agreed to accelerate the phaseout schedules 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
for the substances already controlled by the Protocol. They also added phaseout requirements 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
for other ozone-depleting chemicals, including methyl chloroform, carbon tetrachloride, and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
other fully-halogenated chlorofluorocarbons (CFCs). 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
On November 15, 1990, then-President Bush signed the Clean Air Act Amendments 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(CAAA) of 1990. Title VI, section 604 of the amended CAA requires a phaseout of CFCs, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
halons, and carbon tetrachloride by 2000, which is identical to the London Amendments to 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the Montreal Protocol, but with more stringent interim reductions. Title VI also differs from 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the London Amendments by mandating a faster phaseout of methyl chloroform (2002 instead 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
of 2005), a restriction on the use of hydrochlorofluorocarbons (HCFCs) after 2015, and a ban 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
on the production of HCFCs after 2030. In Title VI, section 602, the CFCs, halons, carbon 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
tetrachloride, and methyl chloroform are defined as class I substances; HCFCs are referred to 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
as class II substances. Appendix A of this final rule lists the class I and class II substances 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
identified in the CAA. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In addition to the phaseout requirements, Title VI includes provisions to reduce 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
emissions of class I and II substances to the ``lowest achievable level'' in the refrigeration 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
sector and to maximize the use of recycling and recovery upon disposal (section 608). It also 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
requires EPA to ban certain nonessential products containing ozone-depleting substances 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(section 610); establish standards and requirements for the servicing of motor vehicle air 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
conditioners (section 609); mandate warning labels on products made with or containing 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
class I or containing class II substances (section 611); and establish a safe alternatives 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
program (section 612). The development and implementation of the safe alternatives program 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
under section 612 is the subject of this final rule. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In October 1991, the National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA) 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
announced new findings documenting ozone depletion over the last decade that was more 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
severe than had previously been predicted by atmospheric modeling or measurements. In 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
particular, NASA found 2.9 percent ozone depletion over the northern mid-latitudes over the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
past decade in summertime_the first time a trend showing ozone depletion had been detected 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
in the U.S. during that time of year, when risks from depletion are greatest. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Partly in response to these findings, on February 11, 1992, then-President Bush 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
announced an accelerated phaseout schedule for class I substances as identified in the CAA, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
as amended, section 606. This final schedule, published in the 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 -->
Federal Register
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 (58 FR 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
65018; December 10, 1993), implements a January 1, 1996 phaseout of class I chemicals. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The President also ordered an accelerated review of substitutes that reduce damage to the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
ozone layer. The expedited phaseout schedule and the President's directive regarding 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
alternatives added urgency to EPA's effort to review and list substitutes for class I and II 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
substances under section 612.
