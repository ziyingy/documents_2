  [Text] China is to intensify its war against drug abuse 
and illicit trafficking, hoping to reduce drug-related climes to 
the lowest possible level a top anti-drugs official said 
yesterday in Beijing. 
  Close cooperation among police and customs in all provinces 
and with the international community will be needed to fight the 
drug war, the official warned. 
  Zhuo Feng, deputy secretary general of the National 
Narcotics 
Control Commission, made these remarks just before the 
International Day Against Drug Abuse and Illicit Trafficking 
which falls on Sunday. 
  All provinces and cities will stage public awareness 
activities to alert people about the dangers of drugs. 
  In the first quarter of this year, more than 4,910 
narcotics-related cases were solved and 6,624 suspects were 
detained. This marked a 64.6 percent and 40 percent increase 
over the same period last year. 
  Seizures included 1.007 kilograms of heroin and 476 
kilograms 
of opium, Zhuo said. 
  Last year, a total of 26,191 drug cases were cracked and 
40,834 suspects were detained. 
  During that year police and customs seized 4,459 kilograms 
of 
heroin, 3,354 kilograms of opium and 90 tons of chemicals which 
could be made into narcotics. 
  Among the detained, 6,137 were sentenced. Some 1,410 
received death sentence or terms of life imprisonment. 
  China's anti-drug campaign has focused on the Guangxi Zhuang 
Autonomous Region and Yunnan Province, both bordering the 
notorious "Golden Triangle" in Myanmar [Burma], Thailand and 
Laos. 
  The border provinces accounted for about 80 per cent of the 
heroin and 70 percent of the opium seized in the country in the 
first three months this year, Zhuo said. 
  Estimates of the number of drug addicts in the country stand 
at 250,000. Over 400 drug rehabilitation centres have been 
established to help the addicts quit their criminal vice. 
  Last year, about 50,000 gave up their addiction after 
treatment in the centres, he said. 
  He also revealed that 982 HIV positive cases among the 1,106 
found in the mainland were caused by drugs addiction and 
injection. 
  HIV is a major virus which can lead to AIDS. 
  Zhuo said that his commission and the Ministry of Public 
Security have drafted a set of rules to force drug addicts to 
quit. The rules have been submitted to the State Council and 
are expected to be approved and implemented later this year. 
  The country has been actively cooperating with international 
organizations on narcotics control. Personnel training and 
information exchanges on drug trafficking cases have been 
carried out with some countries. 
  The narcotics control programme of China, Myanmar and the UN 
is being carried out smoothly and China's cooperation with 
Thailand and Laos in this field has also been strengthened.
