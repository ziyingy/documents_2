THE proposed merger of two Californian electricity companies, which would
create the largest investor-owned power utility in the US, suffered a
potentially fatal setback yesterday when state regulators blocked the deal.
SCEcorp, the parent of Southern California Edison, which provides power in
the Los Angeles area, has been trying since 1988 to take over San Diego Gas
and Electric in a deal valued at more than Dollars 2.8bn. SCEcorp can appeal
against the regulators' veto, but it was unclear yesterday whether it would
do so.
The unanimous ruling by the California Public Utilities Commission follows
its consideration of a 1,300-page report, published last February, which
said the benefits of the merger would be outweighed by its negative impact
on competition.
The decision comes in the wake of several recent mergers in the widely
fragmented power generation sector. Analysts have suggested this could be
the start of a wave of takeover bids which would allow utilities to reap
economies through pooling.
The Californian PUC said it had ruled against the merger because the
utilities had not proven that the deal would provide long-term net benefits
for customers, and because it would have adverse effects on competition
among utilities which transmit power or which sell in the open market the
excess electricity they have generated.
