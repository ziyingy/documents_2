RUSSIAN and Chilean scientists are to begin studying the depletion of the
atmosphere's protective ozone layer over Chile.
The joint project will be backed by the air force of Chile (Fach) and the
Physics Institute of the Russian Academy of Sciences, which signed a
scientific protocol in Santiago at the weekend. Russia will provide a M-17
aircraft equiped to study atmospheric conditions at high altitudes. The
research team will include Fach meteorologists as well as scientists from
both countries.
The involvement of the Chilean air force is an indication of how widespread
concern has become over the problem of ozone depletion. Last spring, farmers
and fishermen in Chile's far south raised the alarm by reporting that sheep,
wild rabbits and salmon were going blind.
The inhabitants of these remote parts also began to suffer from eye
irritations, allergies and severe skin burns. The symptoms were blamed on
the growth of the springtime ozone hole over the Antarctic, which is
beginning to extend over parts of southern Australia, New Zealand and Chile.
The ozone hole, caused by the accumulation of chlorofluorocarbons (CFCs)
above the Antarctic, allows increased levels of cancer-causing ultraviolet
rays to reach the earth.
Apart from the Russian-Chilean project, another team of Chilean scientists
began this year to monitor levels of ultraviolet radiation reaching the
entire length of the country. Greenpeace, the environmental lobby group, has
also sent a fact-finding mission to the southern tip of Latin America.
