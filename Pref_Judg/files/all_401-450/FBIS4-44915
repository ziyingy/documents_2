<H5>  2. Other AIST Lab-Related Policies </H5>
<H5>  1. Promotion of Cooperative International Research </H5>
  There has been a trend taking place in recent years among 
countries of attaching great importance to so-called 
technological diplomacy. Technology is more often than not 
becoming the centerpiece of conversation between national 
leaders at local and international conferences. 
  As international acclaim for Japanese manufacturing 
techniques has grown, so too have the number of requests from 
advanced countries in Europe and North America to exchange 
technologies, which until recently thought they had very little 
to learn from Japan. Japan is continually being asked to take an 
active role at the international level and to enact policies 
that allow for exchanges of technology with developing countries. 
  Japan has also been asked to intensify the work it is doing 
to foster cooperative science and technology agreements between 
the United States and Japan, and to step up the work it is doing 
on global environmental issues where there has been much 
worldwide concern. 
  In that context, in FY93, AIST will extend invitations to 
foreign researchers to come to Japan in order to bolster its 
international research exchange programs and international 
research cooperation agreements involving global environment 
related technologies. In addition, it will enact some new 
programs as part of the New Energy and Industrial Technology 
Development Organization (NEDO) project to promote international 
industrial technologies. 
  (1) Promotion of International Joint Research and Research 
Cooperation 
  1--Specific International Joint Research Programs 
  AIST will try to promote joint R&amp;D programs between its 
national research laboratories and those research institutes in 
advanced countries which share the same concerns. As for general 
research projects in 1993, in addition to the three research 
projects being continued from the previous year, there are also 
three new joint research projects. With regard to international 
joint research on global environmental issues, in addition to 
the two projects from the previous year and one new project, 
there will be one new project having to do with multi-country 
frameworks for conducting specific joint research projects. 
  2--Cooperation Agreements with Developing Countries 
  a. International Trade and Industry Technology Program (ITIT 
Program) 
  This program has to do with resolving research issues and 
improving research with developing countries by applying the 
research potential of national research laboratories to 
cooperative research in the mining and manufacturing fields 
where the strongest requests have been made by developing 
countries. 
  In 1993, AIST will set up a new research cooperation program 
consisting of specific key research topics in which it will lend 
its technical support to developing countries to help them 
develop supporting industries essential to achieving economic 
independence. AIST also intends to upgrade and strengthen its 
research programs having to do with global environmental 
technologies in order to cope with the worldwide demands 
concerning environmental pollution, i.e. destruction of forests, 
acid rain, etc., that have become of increasing concern in 
recent years. 
  b. Research Cooperation Program 
  [Research cooperation on machine translation system for 
neighboring countries] 
  This program focuses on the development of a machine 
translation system that can provide translations between 
Japanese, Chinese, Thai, Malaysian, and Indonesian. It will be 
used to help resolve various economic and social issues shared 
by developing countries. 
  [Research cooperation on technology for recovering valuable 
resources from brackish water] 
  This is an R&amp;D program that focuses on developing a 
comprehensive system for systematically recovering valuable 
resources such as lithium, barium, bromine, magnesium, and boron 
which can be found in brackish water from Mexican salt 
manufacturing plants and Chinese salt water lakes. 
  [Research cooperation on preserving and sustaining 
biological 
diversity] 
  This is an R&amp;D program in which AIST labs will conduct 
cooperative research with Southeast Asia which has rich tropical 
rain forests, and is designed to enable them to harvest, 
preserve, and sustain the bioresources that exist in those rain 
forests. 
  (2) International Research Exchange Program 
  This is a research program that invites foreign researchers 
from countries that have exhibited the strongest interest in 
such programs. It will involve increasing the number of young 
foreign researchers invited to national research laboratories 
from countries that have indicated a particularly strong 
interest. The program also investigates the possibility of those 
researchers being accepted by private research institutes, which 
then will decide the subject matter to be researched. 
  The program also provides various support services such as a 
Japanese language training program, lifestyle adjustment advice, 
housing accommodations, and personal references in order to 
assist the foreign researchers in adjusting to the new lifestyle 
of Japan and to ease their acceptance at AIST laboratories.

<H5>  2. Program Promoting Basic Research Facilities </H5>
  As R&amp;D in the area of industrial technologies has 
increased, 
the facilities required to conduct that R&amp;D have gotten 
larger 
and become more specialized. This has made it cost ineffective 
for individual companies and research organizations to purchase 
advanced research and development facilities. This program, 
based on private funding alone, provides companies with the 
facilities and researchers they will need to conduct advanced 
research. 
  The operation and upkeep of the facilities is based on the 
law pertaining to industrial technology R&amp;D (1988 Law No. 
33), 
and is carried out by corporations designated by the New Energy 
Development and Industrial Technology Organization (NEDO). 
  Completed Projects Outlined 
  (1) Underground Zero-Gravity Experimental Research Center 
(location: Kami-Sunagawa, Hokkaido) 
  The center is made from an existing shaft of an old coal 
mine 
and equipped with vertical free-fall equipment and is used to 
conduct various types of short-term (10 seconds) zero-gravity 
experiments. The center was founded in March, 1989, and a 
portion of the facility was opened for public use in 1991. 
  (2) Super High-Temperature Materials Research Center 
(locations: Ube City, Yamaguchi Pref.; Tajimi City, Gifu Pref.) 
  These are two facilities that were built for the express 
purpose of conducting research and evaluation on the physical 
properties and functions of materials under very high 
temperatures. 
  (3) Mining and Manufacturing Applied Research Center on 
Marine Life Uses (locations: Kamaishi City, Iwate Pref.; 
Kiyomizu City, Shizuoka Pref.) 
  These centers were built for conducting research on marine 
life uses for the mining and manufacturing industries. The 
center was founded in November, 1988, and opened for use in 1990. 
  (4) Ion Engineering Center (location: inside Kansai Cultural 
Science Research City in Hirakata, Osaka) 
  This facility was built for conducting research on ion beam 
applications for industry. It was founded in November, 1988, and 
opened for use in 1992. 
  (3) Laser Application Engineering Center (location: Nagaoka 
City, Niigata Prefecture) 
  This facility was built for doing research on laser 
applications in industry. The center was founded in March, 1990, 
and fully opened for use in 1992. 
  Furthermore, for the leading-edge basic investigative 
research programs of the type that would make use of the 
research facilities opened in 1992, we have selected those 
leading-edge basic research projects which have the possibility 
of being tied to R&amp;D in the future which would make use of 
those 
facilities, and have started investigative research on ways of 
implementing uses of those basic research facilities. 
  In 1993, NEDO has been allocated &yen;300 billion in general 
grant money. 
<H5>  3. Regional Technology Exchange Program </H5>
  (policies regarding research exchange and technology 
mergers) 
  As science and technology have evolved, regional companies 
have become more actively involved in research and development. 
This has created new research and technology needs rooted in the 
unique industrial characteristics of those particular regions. 
In that context, the expectations placed on national research 
laboratories established in respective regions of the country 
are growing every year. In truth, however, those expectations 
have not been met because the research laboratories in those 
areas lack the necessary human and technical resources. 
  Looking back at the rapid progress made in recent years in 
science and technology, we take note of how specialized research 
has become and the fact that mergers have taken place between 
various research fields. In order to make the best use of 
limited human and financial resources in those national research 
laboratories and conduct effective research, this program will 
try to identify the "seeds" of new research and give more 
careful thought to research projects and how they relate to new 
theories and phenomena. 
  For that reason, this program will try to address regional 
research and technology needs by examining the research 
potential existing in both regional research laboratories and 
Tsukuba research laboratories. 
  With regard to specific activities, the program will send 
top-level researchers from AIST for temporary periods of time to 
places doing leading research in those particular regions. These 
researchers will try to ascertain the direction of research and 
the research needs in those particular regions by conducting 
experiments and holding discussions at those research facilities. 
  (Program Outline) 
  (1) Regional Research and Technology Needs 
  To deal with regional research and technology needs in each 
geographical region, local research laboratories in each region 
have been conducting research by establishing research topics 
that concern the particular needs of their respective region. In 
certain cases where difficulties have been encountered 
implementing this research, AIST research labs offer the support 
of researchers working in Tsukuba research laboratories who try 
to help them solve the particular problems at their 
laboratories, thereby providing an effective and appropriate 
response to the regional needs of these research laboratories. 
  In addition, certain researchers from Tsukuba research 
laboratories are assigned for fixed periods of time (a few 
years) as research exchange officers to regional research 
laboratories, and several times a year for periods of a few 
weeks each. These researchers are sent to their assigned 
regional research laboratory to provide general research 
assistance, e.g. identifying research projects. More 
specifically, by putting those researchers in a research 
advisory role, this program tries to improve the research 
potential in particular research fields at particular research 
laboratories. It targets personnel development and tries to deal 
appropriately with the research and technology needs of each 
research laboratory. 
  (2) Centralized Research Labs With Researchers From Various 
Labs 
  The program seeks to identify the "seeds" of new research 
related to particular research fields by having researchers from 
research laboratories with different advanced research agendas 
discuss the problems they are confronted with in their fields of 
study for fixed periods of time at a centrally located place.

<H5>  4. Japan Key Technology Center Program </H5>
  In November, 1985, the Japan Key Technology Center was 
opened 
in order to promote experimental research. It was designed 
primarily to support basic and applied research by private 
industry which accounts for around 80 percent of the R&amp;D 
expenditures in Japan. The FY93 budget proposal to fund such 
programs, which are its main activities, is &yen;28.5 billion. 
This contains &yen;26 billion for funding the special industrial 
investment account, and &yen;20 billion for loan recovery. 
  The total 1992 budget for programs was &yen;28.5 billion 
with 
&yen;26 billion being earmarked for the special industrial 
investments and &yen;2.5 billion for loan recovery. 
  Below, we list the basic activities of the Japan Key 
Technology Center. 
  (1) Capital Investment Program 
  This program invests in corporations which have been 
established jointly by two or more corporations. The companies

------------------------------------------------------------------------------- 


<H5>  5. Research Findings and Technology Surveys and PR </H5>
  (1) Research Findings 
  The research findings obtained through both research 
laboratories operated by the Agency of Industrial Science and 
Technology (AIST) and through various AIST-commissioned R&amp;D 
programs are the licensed property of the Agency of Industrial 
Science and Technology, and gaining access to those findings is 
done by paying an appropriate royalty for their use. Obtaining 
access to those results has gotten easier recently, particularly 
for overseas parties wanting that information. In FY93, 
therefore, AIST will try to disseminate its research findings 
over a wider area by stepping up PR and mediation activities on 
AIST industrial property rights. It will also try to prevent 
improper use of those rights by implementing proper control 
measures regarding their property rights. 
  (2) Technical Surveys and PR 
  In order to sustain sound economic growth in the face of 
environmental changes brought about by Japanese industry both 
inside and outside Japan, it is essential that technology be 
developed in a comprehensive and effective manner. When it comes 
to promoting the development of technology, AIST must draft 
comprehensive and relevant technical policies and increase the 
level of recognition and understanding of those policies and 
measures. To do that, the following steps are being taken: 
  1--Technical Surveys 
  This involves doing surveys on R&amp;D trends both inside 
and 
outside Japan, evaluating the development of a technology, 
trying to come up with the best ways to make research 
predictions, and incorporating this information into the 
planning and drafting of technical policies. 
  2--PR 
  In addition to conducting PR related to preparation and 
distribution of materials related to AIST operations and 
achievements, this involves consolidating technical materials 
from both inside and outside Japan. 
  (3) Developing Computer Applications 
  In addition to operating the Computer Application Research 
Association established by the AIST executive committee and the 
investigative research on technical problems faced in 
specialized fields which must increase the use of the computers 
in government bureaus and ministries, this program is aimed at 
developing such things as fuzzy logic applications, methods of 
assessing the introduction of software, and computer 
applications. It also includes promoting the use of research 
findings and trying to improve applied computer technologies and 
other new technologies. 
  (Reference) 
  In terms of the technical issues that administrative fields 
are facing in implementing the use of the computer, the Applied 
Computer Technology Research Association, which was formed in 
1968 and has a technical staff of 610 members spread throughout 
29 ministries and agencies, will undertake the following 
activities with the help of the people responsible and 
knowledgeable about computer applications in ministries and 
agencies to conduct multifaceted investigative research. 
  1--Survey on present status and trends inside and outside 
Japan regarding latest computer applications. 
  2--Computer applications that can be shared by various 
ministries and agencies. 
  3--Technical exchanges between ministries and agencies in 
order to raise the level of computer applications. 
  4--Dissemination and use of research findings by joint 
announcements and PR releases.
