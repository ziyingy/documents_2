World Travel Watch is a monthly report designed to help you make informed 
judgments about travel throughout the world. Because conditions can change 
overnight, always make your own inquiries before you leave home. In the United 
States, contact the nearest passport agency office; abroad, check in with the 
nearest American embassy.

Asia 
</P>
<P>
China/Pakistan: The Kunjerab Pass on the Karakoram Highway at the 
China/Pakistan border is closed. Although Kashgar, the oasis market town in far 
west China, has been reopened to tourists, the only way in at this time is the 
long way around -- through China on the Silk Road. 
</P>
<P>
India: Troubled Kashmir remains off-limits to travelers, but the governments of 
India and Pakistan have agreed to hold high-level talks soon to try to work out 
a solution in the contested region. 
</P>
<P>
Nepal: Katmandu is essentially peaceful now, with curfews ended, but expect the 
occasional disruption of services by workers' strikes, a new phenomenon that 
has come with the hard-earned democracy. Trekking agencies are planning for a 
good autumn season. 
</P>
<P>
Sri Lanka: After nine months of relative peace, increased foreign investment 
and renewed tourism, violence has returned on a disturbing scale with Tamil 
guerrillas in the north and east abandoning a year-old cease-fire and attacking 
police installations. Several massacres by Tamil guerrillas have been reported 
in outlying villages. With tough talk coming from military leaders about 
showing the insurgents no mercy, it appears the spiral of violence will 
continue. Exercise caution and avoid traveling to areas in and around Jaffna, 
Trincomalee and Batticaloa. 
</P>
<P>
Africa 
</P>
<P>
Algeria: Islamic fundamentalists swept recent elections in this heretofore 
secular North African country. What this means for travelers is uncertain, 
though alcohol proscription and a conservative Islamic dress code for women 
(and its attendant effect on female travelers) may be ahead. 
</P>
<P>
Gabon: Unnecessary travel to Port Gentil should be avoided due to recent civil 
unrest and demonstrations. Check with the U.S. Embassy in Libreville for 
updated information, and register with the U.S. Embassy on arrival in Gabon. 
</P>
<P>
Liberia: Although the civil war has quieted and peace talks are under way, the 
country remains volatile. Avoid travel here at this time. 
</P>
<P>
Europe/Soviet Union 
</P>
<P>
France/Germany/the Netherlands/Belgium/Luxembourg: By early 1992, these 
countries hope to abolish border checks, months in advance of the 12-nation 
European Community's deadline of Jan. 1, 1993, to remove internal border 
controls. Known as the Schengen Accord for the Luxembourg town in which it was 
signed June 19, the agreement (when it is ratified by the five countries) 
should speed cross-border traffic and give the EEC some experience in border 
integration. 
</P>
<P>
Romania: Unrest continues and the potential for violence remains, especially in 
Bucharest. Exercise caution, and avoid any demonstrations or large gatherings 
of people. 
</P>
<P>
Soviet Union: In major cities such as Moscow and Leningrad, the dollar is king. 
Expect to pay for taxis and restaurant and hotel services with greenbacks, not 
rubles. Bring along a good supply of $1, $5 and $10 bills. 
</P>
<P>
Caribbean/Central America 
</P>
<P>
Dominican Republic: The dollar goes a long way here, but be careful with 
tortoise-shell products. Many tortoise species are endangered and importation 
of such goods to the United States is prohibited. These items could be seized 
by U. S. Customs and their bearers subject to fines. It's best to avoid buying 
any animal products. 
</P>
<P>
Nicaragua: Now that the eight-year civil war has ended, hopes are high that the 
troubled country can move ahead into a new era of peace and prosperity. 
Visitors must exchange $60 U.S. into cordobas at the port of entry. Major 
hotels in Managua, and some smaller hotels and hostels, charge foreigners in U. 
S. currency and won't accept traveler's checks, so make sure you take enough 
cash to cover expenses. Credit cards are infrequently accepted. Travel from 
Honduras to Nicaragua should be done only by air because of border security 
problems, including minefields, particularly along the Rio Coco and Atlantic 
Coast region. 
</P>
<P>
Southeast Asia 
</P>
<P>
Cambodia: The Khmer Rouge has agreed to proposals for putting the 12th-Century 
ruins of Angkor Wat under U.N. management as a demilitarized zone.
