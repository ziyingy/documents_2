THE Church Society yesterday won permission to seek a High Court declaration
aimed at blocking moves to allow the ordination of women as Church of
England priests.
Lord Justice Simon Brown, sitting with Mr Justice Buckley, indicated that
the court intends to give the society - the Church's most influential
evangelical body - leave to seek a judicial review.
The society plans to seek a declaration that members of the Ecclesiastical
Committee of both houses of parliament acted outside their powers in
deciding to back proposed legislation paving the way for women's ordination.
