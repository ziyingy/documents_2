  [Text] Yichang, January 24 (XINHUA) -- China is looking for 
international co-operation in designing and producing huge 
generators for the Three Gorges project. 
  The project, in central China's Hubei Province, started last 
year and is scheduled to be completed in the coming 17 years; 
the 11th year will see the first set of generators producing 
electricity. 
  A group of 26 water turbo-generators for the project are 
planned to have an installed capacity of 700,000 kw each. They 
will be among the biggest in the world when they are installed. 
  To pave the way for international co-operation for the 
project's generators, a month-long symposium was held late last 
year, with more than 90 Chinese and foreign experts taking part. 
  Many leading foreign companies with experience in building 
power- generation equipment above 600,000 kw were represented, 
including the Volth and Siemens companies of Germany, G.E. of 
Canada, Hitachi, Toshiba and Mitsui of Japan, and LMZ and 
Electrical of Russia.
