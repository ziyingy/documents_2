Carolyn Kott and many of her neighbors on the east side of Palmdale feel like 
they're fighting a losing battle. The enemy is dirt, and they say they can't 
seem to keep it out of their homes, off their cars or from muddying their 
pools. 
</P>
<P>
Ever since developers several months ago stripped the vegetation from several 
large lots nearby, residents in the Antelope Valley neighborhood say they have 
had to live with clouds of dirt blown by the high desert's winds. Housecleaning 
has become virtually futile. 
</P>
<P>
"I've just gotten so disgusted," said Kott, standing with her husband on their 
dirt-covered back-yard patio. "It doesn't do any good. I'll clean this up, and 
it will be like this again in a few days. You just can't seem to keep ahead of 
it." 
</P>
<P>
Although severe, the problems in Kott's Palmdale neighborhood are hardly 
unique. Few places or people in the high desert this year have escaped being 
blanketed by the onslaught of dirt and sand that residents say is the worst 
they have seen in decades. 
</P>
<P>
Blustery winds are nothing new to the high desert, but this year they have 
combined with a record fourth year of drought, a decline in the amount of 
acreage devoted to crops and the clearing of land for development to strip the 
soil from the valley. 
</P>
<P>
Last month, the South Coast Air Quality Management District conducted a public 
hearing about the desert's dust problems and decided to extend for another 18 
months its monitoring of air quality in the area. AQMD officials said, however, 
that the amount of dust in the Antelope Valley's air does not exceed federal 
standards. 
</P>
<P>
Several of the 40 valley residents who attended the meeting disagreed with that 
assessment and said the experts' monitoring techniques have failed to detect 
the seriousness of the problem. 
</P>
<P>
In developed parts of the valley, where other structures or landscaping offer 
some protection from the wind and dirt, residents still have been forced to 
cover their pools and cars, and weatherproof their houses. Contact lens wearers 
have suffered from irritated and watery eyes. 
</P>
<P>
In areas exposed to the open desert or near construction sites, the problems 
have been more severe, forcing people indoors and covering their houses, 
furniture and floors with a layer of fine-grained dust and sand. For some, it 
has caused health problems to worsen. For almost everyone, it's meant a lot of 
cleaning up. 
</P>
<P>
"The dirt gets on the sidewalks and the entrance way, and all over the house," 
said George Greene, a retired Lancaster aerospace engineer who blames 
developers for the severity of the dust problems and officials in Lancaster and 
Palmdale for failing to respond. 
</P>
<P>
The worst conditions have arisen near the rapidly growing area's many 
construction sites, where the ground cover has been removed and dirt is piled 
next to excavations. Residents say their complaints, however, aren't bringing 
any action. 
</P>
<P>
The Antelope Valley's two largest cities, Lancaster and Palmdale, have 
ordinances requiring construction sites to be dampened with water to control 
dirt and dust. But residents say the cities are slow to respond to complaints, 
and watering is, at best, a temporary solution. 
</P>
<P>
City officials say they and developers do what they can but admit it's 
difficult. "Out here, trying to keep dust down in heavy winds is impossible. 
It's a fact of life unless you stop all of the construction" or plant grass 
everywhere, said Roy Stilson, a Palmdale public works inspector. 
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, some city and construction industry officials complain that another 
cause of the sandstorms has been animals that destroy vegetation by overgrazing 
vast areas of rangeland in the far west Antelope Valley. Occasionally powerful 
westerly winds then sweep up the dirt and deposit it miles away on city 
streets. 
</P>
<P>
The drought also has been a major factor, leaving the region bone-dry and 
choking off desert vegetation that might otherwise have kept the topsoil in 
place. As a result, large sections of the valley have become virtual sand 
dunes. 
</P>
<P>
The same phenomena also have occurred this year in other Southern California 
desert areas. Because of unusually strong winds and dry conditions, heaps of 
blowing sand have closed roads and frustrated residents in the Riverside County 
communities of Palm Desert, Cathedral City and Rancho Mirage. 
</P>
<P>
Already this year in the Antelope Valley, at least half-a-dozen windstorms with 
gusts up to 60 m.p.h. have raised towering clouds of sand and dirt and reduced 
visibility in some places to near zero, causing dozens of traffic collisions. 
</P>
<P>
The conditions have also alarmed officials at Palmdale's commercial airport and 
the area's two military airports, Plant 42 in Palmdale and Edwards Air Force 
Base to the north. Officials there fear the blowing dirt could interfere with 
flight and testing activities. 
</P>
<P>
Large sandstorms have swept over the entire valley sporadically this year. But 
localized dust problems have occurred far more frequently near construction 
sites where even average-strength winds can pick up dirt exposed by 
excavations. Although smaller in scale, the dirt problems near construction 
sites can be intense, with mini-sand dunes piling up almost over night on front 
lawns. 
</P>
<P>
Marie Wells said she knew nothing about such conditions when she and her 
husband moved from the South Bay to buy their first home in Lancaster about 1 
1/2 years ago. The young couple picked a house built across from a vacant lot 
and soon discovered open spaces aren't always an amenity. 
</P>
<P>
Dirt kicked up by a house builder on that property enveloped the neighborhood 
and forced the family to spend thousands of dollars to seal windows, replace 
carpeting and drapes and even repaint their new home's sandblasted exterior. 
</P>
<P>
Last month, the Wellses and 10 other families were each awarded $1,850 in what 
Lancaster officials said was the first criminal case in the region in which a 
developer had been ordered to pay homeowners for damages caused by blowing 
dirt. 
</P>
<P>
Dana Harold Smith of the Costa Mesa-based Rialto Development Co. pleaded no 
contest to one misdemeanor count under the city's ordinance and was ordered to 
begin paying each of the families in $100-a-month installments. But Wells said 
the families have yet to receive any money.
