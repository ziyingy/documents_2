<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
to include entities with up to $40 million in gross revenues, and we will allow these small businesses to pool their
resources and form consortia to bid in the entrepreneurs' blocks. We also adopt rules that allow entrepreneurial
businesses, small businesses, and businesses owned by women and minorities to raise capital by attracting passive
equity investors. At the same time, we have designed these rules to ensure that the special provisions adopted for
such businesses accrue to the intended beneficiaries.

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
113. As discussed more fully below, many commenters in this proceeding believe that the inability of designated entities
to obtain adequate funding has a profoundly adverse effect on the potential for these businesses to bid successfully
in auctions against very large, established businesses. Therefore, we take a number of steps in this Order to help
address this imbalance.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
&bull;We establish two ``entrepreneurs' blocks'' (frequency blocks C and F) in which large companies (those with
$125 million or more in annual gross revenues or $500 million or more in total assets) will be prohibited from bidding.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
&bull;Bidding credits will be granted both to small businesses and to businesses owned by women and minorities in
the entrepreneurs' blocks to provide them with a better opportunity to compete successfully in broadband PCS auctions.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
&bull;Certain winning bidders in frequency blocks C and F will be permitted to pay the license price in installments,
and the interest rate and moratorium on principal payments will be adjusted to assist small businesses and women and
minority-owned businesses.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
&bull;We adopt a tax certificate program for minority and women-owned businesses, which will provide additional
assistance in their efforts to attract equity investors.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
&bull;Rural telephone companies will be allowed to obtain broadband PCS licenses that are geographically partitioned
from larger PCS service areas to provide them more flexibility to serve rural subscribers.

In a Further Notice of Proposed Rule Making in this docket, we will seek comment on whether a partitioning option for
small businesses or businesses owned by women or minorities, as suggested by some of the commenters, may be appropriate.
In that Further Notice, we also will seek comment or whether the Commission should impose a restriction on the assignment
or transfer of control of partitioned licenses by rural telephone companies or other designated entities for some
period of time.

&bull;Bidders in the entrepreneurs' blocks will be required to pay an upfront payment of only $0.015 per MHz per pop,
in contrast to the $0.02 per MHz per pop required in the other blocks.

Control Group. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

The gross revenues, total assets and personal net worth of certain investors are not considered so long as the applicant
has a `'control group'' consisting of one or more individuals or entities that control the applicant, hold at least
25 percent of the equity and, for corporations, at least 50.1 percent of the voting stock.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
