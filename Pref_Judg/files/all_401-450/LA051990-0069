Drawing, TROUBLED SPACECRAFT: Insulation bats that keep the Soviet Soyuz 
spacecraft from getting too cold in orbit were apparently torn loose at one end 
during the ship's ascent into space. Floating free, the insulation will block 
sensors needed to align the craft for re-entry. Using an extendable ladder to 
be taken to Mir by a resupply craft, the astronauts will either cut the 
insulation loose or fasten it back down., SANDY KAY / Los Angeles Times
