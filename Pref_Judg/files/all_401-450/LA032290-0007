State labor and safety officials raided more than 70 sewing shops and issued 
more than $63,000 in fines this week in one of the largest raids on suspected 
sweatshops in Orange County. The sweep was aimed at cracking down on repeat 
offenders by making surprise inspections of garment factories that have been 
cited before for wage, hour, child-labor or record-keeping violations. "We want 
to make sure they know we're serious, and not just think that we issue a 
citation, they pay, and we forget the whole thing," said Senior Labor Deputy 
Phil Galvez. Tuesday's inspections centered on Garden Grove, Westminster, Santa 
Ana and Huntington Beach.
