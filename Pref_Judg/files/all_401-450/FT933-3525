Hurricane Lydia, gusting at up to 125 mph, was yesterday headed towards
Mexico's Pacific coast, threatening flimsy homes and poor neighbourhoods
from Tepic to Los Mochis, AP reports from Mexico City.
The National Water Commission, which tracks storms, said on Sunday the
hurricane was 'extremely dangerous' and issued an alert for coastal areas
400 miles south of the US border.
Thousands fled their homes as Lydia lashed the west coast of Mexico early
yesterday with strong winds and heavy rain.
Officials in the state of Sinaloa were evacuating residents from low-lying
areas in anticipation of heavy flooding. Police said an estimated 30,000
people in the Mazatlan area left their homes on Sunday night as the storm
approached.
