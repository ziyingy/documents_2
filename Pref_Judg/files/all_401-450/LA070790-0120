theologian disagree with the Pope? A recent instruction from the Vatican 
proclaimed that theologians have no right to dissent publicly from official 
church teachings, even those not considered infallible or based on divine 
revelation. The Times asked two Catholic theologians to present their differing 
views on the controversial issue. From time to time, those involved in 
religious issues will be asked to speak out on their ideas.
