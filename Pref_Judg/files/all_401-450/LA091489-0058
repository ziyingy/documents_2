Today's genealogists are ignoring valuable sources to their research problems 
-- local histories, geography and migration patterns of ethnic groups. Without 
this knowledge of places in which your families once lived, you will never be a 
successful genealogist.

Researchers often complain that they can find nothing about an ancestor who was 
born in 1750 Lincoln County, N.C. Well, no wonder. Lincoln County did not exist 
in 1750. It was created out of Tryon County in 1778. By studying the county 
divisions of North Carolina one learns that what eventually became Lincoln 
County was part of Anson County in 1760, which in turn was created in 1750 from 
Bladen County. The records the researcher needs will be in Colonial North 
Carolina sources and filed under Anson and Bladen counties.

Each region, each state and each county has its own history, and in order to 
locate records of genealogical interest you need to study a locale's history: 
its political divisions, migration patterns, early settlers, religious and 
ethnic groups, and its economic development and industries. Since the average 
family (prior to the Civil War) moved about six times during their adulthood, 
you will learn a lot about several locales.

Local histories -- histories of states, counties and localities -- often 
contain a great amount of genealogical information; unfortunately they are 
seldom footnoted and vary greatly in quality. In many local histories you will 
find eulogies of families, often filled with errors, especially in respect to 
early generations of lines.

However, local histories published prior to 1885 are generally fairly accurate 
for the family history of the Revolutionary and post-Revolutionary periods, for 
they are based for the most part on statements made by members of the family 
who had knowledge of the persons and events of the periods. However, every 
family has its "Uncle Harry" and "Aunt Hester" who never told the same story 
twice; and if they were the source for the information in a particular book, 
you may find glaring discrepancies.

Most university libraries contain extensive collections of U.S., county and 
state histories. Public (and some private) universities and colleges are open 
to researchers -- after all, as a taxpayer you support the public ones. Just 
because you are over 25 does not mean you can't go back to school and use the 
library. Many of them are open on weekends -- ideal for genealogists who work 
Monday through Friday.

Discover the five-volume set, "A Bibliography to United States Local Histories 
in the Library of Congress." The history, reference and/or genealogy 
departments of larger libraries (especially university libraries) will have 
this outstanding reference set. Therein you will discover what books have been 
written about the areas in which you are interested -- the author's name, date 
of publication and enough description to enable you to determine if it is worth 
tracking down a copy of it. Unfortunately local histories in the Library of 
Congress do not circulate, but if you discover a reference to an 1867 Orange 
County, N. Y., history of the Minisink region that interests you; you'll be 
armed with the exact information needed to locate the book in other libraries. 
Of if you are going to the Washington, D.C., area, then you'll want to stop at 
the Library of Congress.
