Look around to the smog, the jagged Himalayas of solid waste and the hungry 
CFCs munching on the ozone layer and, all of a sudden, the phrase "a good 
environment for business" takes on a whole new meaning. The 1980s had 
entrepreneurs; the 1990s will have ecopreneurs. 
</P>
<P>
The environmental and ecology movements have long had their articulate and 
charismatic visionaries -- the Rachel Carsons, the Amory Lovinses, the Paul 
Ehrlichs, etc. What these movements have been missing, however, are visionaries 
with a feel for markets and technologies along with the ability to translate 
ecological ideals into economic realities. There's not yet a Steven P. Jobs or 
a H. Ross Perot of the environment -- an ecopreneur who can simultaneously 
excite both the media and the marketplace. But there will be. 
</P>
<P>
"There seems to be an ecological imperative now," says University of 
Pennsylvania Prof. Thomas P. Hughes, author of "American Genesis," a history of 
American technology and industry. "We first create an intellectual revolution 
and a values revolution -- and then we see a technological revolution. I think 
there are a great number of firms to be established and fortunes to be made 
here. There's an advocacy for the environment today that's similar to the ethic 
of mass production back in the 1920s." 
</P>
<P>
To be sure, an ever-evolving web of government regulation is spinning an 
infrastructure that encourages ecopreneurial investment and innovation. 
Environmental quality standards create market opportunities even as they 
address ecological concerns. Nevertheless, these standards don't reflect a "no 
growth" mentality as much as they do an emerging consensus that we'd be smarter 
to help manage the environment than ignore it. Building those management tools 
and technologies represents a chance to build a new global industry. 
</P>
<P>
That's one reason why venture capital -- normally the source of seed funding 
for high-tech ventures such as genetic engineering and silicon chip design -- 
is beginning to spill into the environment. 
</P>
<P>
"You go where the waste is," says Oliver Nicklin, managing partner of the 
Chicago-based Environmental Venture Fund, a 2-year-old, $40-million venture 
capital fund that Nicklin claims is the first focusing purely on ecopreneurial 
opportunities. "It's almost a bit of a perpetual growth industry." 
</P>
<P>
Where venture capitalists once thought ecopreneurialism a crazy idea, Nicklin 
reports that today he is invited to speak at industry functions, and some of 
the most prestigious names in venture capital now co-invest in his fund's 
deals. "Estimates are that this industry is anywhere from $40 billion of $60 
billion in size and growing," he says. "You can make a lot of money if you have 
even a small piece of that."

"There is enormous potential in many areas of the environment," asserts Alan 
Lloyd, chief scientist of the South Coast Air Quality Management District. 
"People are now much more willing to invest and buy those products." 
</P>
<P>
Given the magnitude of Los Angeles' environmental problems, Southern California 
is a sure bet to emerge as a hotbed and testbed of ecopreneurial activity. 
Lloyd sees market opportunities in technologies ranging from fuel cells for 
power generation to new types of chemical coatings that are less 
environmentally hostile. 
</P>
<P>
Freeway smog, for example, is so corrosive that Lloyd anticipates an 
ecopreneurial niche in custom air filters to clean up the microatmospheres of 
California cars. "There should be a market for a filter to clean up air that's 
coming into your car," Lloyd says. "There are a lot of toxics in the air as 
people commute to work so if you spend a lot of time on the freeway, your 
exposure can be quite high." The AQMD is now sponsoring workshops to encourage 
the diffusion of ecology-flavored technologies.

"We want to look at new technologies," says William Ruckelshaus, the former 
Environmental Protection Agency director who's now chairman and chief executive 
of Browning-Ferris Industries, the $2.5-billion-a-year giant of the solid waste 
management industry. "We get interesting ideas almost daily." 
</P>
<P>
Browning-Ferris recently launched a medical waste division that grew from "zero 
to a $100-million business in less than 24 months," says Ruckelshaus, who 
stresses that there are numerous opportunities for both market segmentation and 
technology application in the waste management field. He sees an increasing 
role for genetically engineered waste-gobbling microorganisms in the 
"bio-remediation" of waste products. 
</P>
<P>
Similarly, "If someone came up with a viable substitute for CFCs (the 
refrigerant chemical that has been linked to ozone depletion) that would be a 
huge market, and if acid rain legislation passes, that also creates enormous 
economic opportunities." 
</P>
<P>
In the same way that genetic engineering technology has created a fundamental 
discontinuity in the agricultural and medical industries, this new Greening of 
America creates a fundamental discontinuity in public attitudes that makes a 
fast-growth ecopreneurial industry a genuine probability. 
</P>
<P>
Yes, there are established businesses such as Browning-Ferris and waste 
management, but with the shifts and swirls in attitudes, legislation and 
technologies -- not to mention the influx of risk capital -- today's status quo 
doesn't stand a chance. The Apple Computers, Genentechs and Federal Expresses 
of the environment are likely to be born in this decade; the children of 1960s 
Idealism and 1980s Greed. That's not a bad pedigree at all, especially if it 
helps us breathe easier. Trend isn't destiny -- but this time, we better hope 
it is.
