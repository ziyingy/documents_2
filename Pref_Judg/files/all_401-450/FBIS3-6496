  [Text] Daewoo Group and Hyowon Mulsan plan to import 
drinking water from North Korea. According to business circles, 
Daewoo Group has held negotiations with North Korean trade 
companies, such as Taesong Trade Company and Nungna Trade 
Company to import drinking water from North Korea. Hyowon 
Mulsan -- which is a professional trade company that imports 
agricultural products from North Korea -- has negotiated with 
the North Korean Taedonggang Trade Company to import "Sindok 
Water." 
  The National Unification Board said that it would not 
immediately allow ROK enterprises to import drinking water from 
North Korea because the Ministry of Public Health has not yet 
allowed enterprises to sell drinking water in Korean markets. 
It added, however, that it would positively consider importing 
drinking water from North Korea for the people's health only if 
the Ministry of Public Health allows it. 
  Up to now, North Korea has developed approximately 100 
plants 
to produce drinking water. These main plants include Sindok 
Water, Kangso Water, Mt. Paektu Water, Changson Water, and 
Sambang Water.
