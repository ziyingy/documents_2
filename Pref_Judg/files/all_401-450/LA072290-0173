What a godsend to read in the newspaper earlier this month of the details of 
the Richard King Mellon Foundation's rescue and subsequent donation to the 
federal government of several wildlife refuges and historic sites for 
preservation in perpetuity. 
</P>
<P>
The Mellon Foundation president said the foundation hoped its gift would 
inspire others to buy and preserve properties. 
</P>
<P>
May the Richard King Mellon Foundation indeed be a trend setter and an 
inspiration to all of us! Listen up, Donald Bren! 
</P>
<P>
I cannot think of an area more in need of inspiration and tender loving care 
than Orange County. The people in my hometown, Laguna Beach, truly appreciate 
beauty and nature and tranquility. 
</P>
<P>
But we, alas, are now well into the third decade of our struggle to save Laguna 
Canyon from the jaws of the bulldozers of the mighty Irvine Co. Unfortunately, 
the amount of money we can raise by taxing our residents $100 a year for 20 
years cannot begin to satisfy the landowner. 
</P>
<P>
I say, Donald Bren, give us a break! Isn't it feasible, reasonable and 
appropriate for the Irvine Co. to donate Laguna Canyon to the City of Laguna 
Beach? Isn't it time to help save the habitat and natural environment that has 
been so wantonly exploited and overdeveloped?
