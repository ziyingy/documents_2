"Russians on Key Problems of Society's Life and on Their Hopes 
for 1994"] 
  [Text] This material reflects 
subjective--socio-psychological, ideological, political, and 
other--aspects of different categories of people's attitudes to 
key problems of economic life of Russian society; the current 
conditions of realization of the population's basic material, 
social, and spiritual needs; their appraisal of the political 
situation; and opinions regarding ways of getting Russia out of 
the economic and political crisis. 
  It is based on the results of a number of all-Russia and 
regional surveys conducted in 1992-1993, and polling the 
experts, among whom were chiefs of the Russian Federation state 
tax services, heads of regional committees of the State 
Antitrust Policy Committee, chairmen of territorial banks of the 
Savings Bank of Russia, enterprise directors, and specialists. 
Wherever the logic of the analysis requires evaluation of its 
dynamics, comparative data of surveys conducted in 1988-1991 are 
given. 
<H5>  Public Opinion: For or Against a Free Market? </H5>
  A substantial change in the economic orientation of the 
population employed in the national economy in favor of a 
transition to a market economy occurred at the point of 
approaching the 1990's. A retrospective comparison of the 
results of sociological surveys conducted in 1988-1990 of the 
population engaged in the production sector provides a snapshot 
of it (in percents of the number of respondents).

the transition to a 
market economy would 
change the situation 
at their enterprise 


  Sociologic research materials show that it is precisely this 
deep economic alienation caused by the vices of the old economic 
system that is the main cause of the people's persistent 
reluctance to return to the command-administrative order of 
organizing production and distributing material goods. The 
syndrome of nonacceptance of the old system of economic life 
affects the mind set of the majority of the Russian population 
in such a way that even a protracted economic crisis and the 
steady decline of the standard of living have not turned most 
people away from the idea of shifting to a market economy as an 
alternative of its barracks-style organization. 
  Despite the fact that the absolute majority of the surveyed 
population already for several years have been expressing acute 
concern with respect to the worsening economic situation of 
enterprises, are seriously worried about potential unemployment, 
and are aggrieved by impoverishment, nevertheless the 
proportional share of supporters of a market economy in Russia 
remains steadily greater than the share of its opponents. For 
instance, in 1991 57 percent of the surveyed populace favored 
development of private enterprise; one year later in June--60 
percent; and in April 1993 private entrepreneurial activities 
were supported by 63 percent of them. True, at the same time 
only a few still believed in a quick success of the ongoing 
reforms, which is supported by the distribution of answers to 
the question "Do you believe in the success of the current 
economic reform?", received in April 1993 (in percents of 
the number of persons polled): 


------------------------------------------------------------------------------- 
|Yes, by the end of the year           |2                                     | 
------------------------------------------------------------------------------- 
|Yes, within two-three years           |15                                    | 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

------------------------------------------------------------------------------- 
|Hard to tell                          |19                                    | 
------------------------------------------------------------------------------- 
|No answer                             |1                                     | 
------------------------------------------------------------------------------- 


  Nevertheless, at least 53 percent of the surveyed populace 
believe that in the medium- or long-term perspective economic 
transformation will produce a positive effect. 
  A positive attitude to the course toward mastering the 
mechanisms of the market economy was expressed by most workers 
and specialist cadres in the national economy, as well as trade 
union leaders polled in June-August 1993 at enterprises in 
Moscow, Stavropol Kray, and Nizhniy Novgorod and Tyumen Oblasts. 
To the question "Do you approve the country's transition 
to a market economy?" the distribution of answers was as follows 
(in percents of 3,400 polled workers, 78 specialist cadres, and 
72 members of enterprise trade union committees): 


                   Workers            Specialist cadres     Trade union 
                                                            leaders 

Yes                57                 55                    49 

No                 21                 12                    30 

No opinion         22                 30                    20 

No answer          -                  3                     1 


  Noting a stable orientation of the working population toward 
market transformations, attention should be drawn to the fact 
that at the same time people express dissatisfaction with 
practical forms of implementing economic reforms, social costs 
of transferring the means of production into private ownership, 
price liberalization, breakdown of old economic ties, and so on. 
This may be seen, for instance, from comparative data of two 
all-Russia population surveys conducted in April 1992 and April 
1993 (as a percentage of the number of persons polled):

------------------------------------------------------------------------------- 


  Thus, while in the matter of privatization of housing a 
certain shift has occurred in the direction of an increase in 
the number of people satisfied with it, in the opinion of the 
people positive shifts in the area of privatization of 
enterprises are minimal. 
  As the survey showed, the latter factor is associated to a 
considerable extent with the fact that enterprises' collectives 
as a rule are removed from the real decision making in 
privatization. Judging by the data of a survey conducted among 
employees at enterprises in Moscow, Stavropol Kray, and Nizhniy 
Novgorod and Tyumen Oblasts in June-August 1993, 70 percent of 
them believe that the decisive word in choosing the 
privatization option for the enterprise must rest with 
enterprise collectives. In reality, however, they note that 
collectives do not participate in it--everything is decided by 
enterprise administration and central and local bodies of 
authority. The polled specialist cadres in the national economy 
and trade union activists supported this appraisal: Only 10 
percent of them said that collectives have not been left out of 
decision making with respect to practical issues of 
privatization of enterprises. 
  The results of the research permit us to say with certainty 
that a quite stable "pro-market" orientation has taken hold in 
the mass consciousness: The share of the populace advocating 
market transformations exceeds the proportional share of those 
who do not accept a transition to a market. However, the support 
for economic innovation is associated not so much with the real 
practice of reform as it is with rejection of the past. In other 
words, the nourishing environment of a pro-market thrust 
reflects to a lesser degree the current life experience of the 
people than it does their past one. 
<H5>  Incentives and Motivations of Business Activities </H5>
  The radical changes in the economic environment and social 
conditions of life that have taken place over the past years 
have caused a change in old norms and values and have led to 
substantial changes in the mechanism of business activities. 
This is manifested most graphically with respect to private 
property and private enterprise. Research conducted in May 1991 
showed that as early as then the notion of private property had 
begun to free itself from the old ideological blinders. 
One-third of the people polled in the all-Russia sample said 
that the notion "private property" is associated in their mind 
with economic prudence, enterprise, and a responsible attitude 
toward the business at hand. In another survey conducted in June 
1992, 25 percent of the respondents expressed the opinion that 
private enterprise is the factor capable of leading Russia out 
of the economic crisis; 16 percent held a diametrically opposite 
point of view; and 59 percent were not certain. 
  It should be noted, however, that a positive attitude in the 
public opinion toward private business so far essentially 
represents nothing other than a new ideological stereotype. 
Speaking of private property in general, in the abstract, the 
respondents mean the prosperity achieved by industrially 
developed countries. When the topic is shifted, however, to 
Russian realities, a considerable number of respondents speak in 
a very negative way of the actions of businessmen with whom they 
have had an opportunity to interact in practice. 
  Still, the general vector of attitudes toward 
entrepreneurial 
activities remains positive. This is supported rather 
convincingly by the results of three all-Russia surveys of the 
general populace conducted by comparable methodology. For 
instance, in May 1990, 34 percent of polled Russians felt that 
development of the private sector in trade and consumer services 
is possible and allowable; in May 1991, 67 percent expressed 
this opinion; and in June 1992--already 70 percent. Let us point 
out that this rather substantial shift in the public attitude 
has taken place despite the worsened situation in the consumer 
market, higher prices, and other negative phenomena. 
  The populace's loyalty to private enterprise is also 
supported by the fact that there has been a shift in the 
positive direction in the opinions regarding work for hire in 
the privatized sector of the economy. The proportional share of 
persons trying to set up their own business is growing. A survey 
conducted in December 1992 in Tomsk Oblast, as well as the 
results of an all-Russia population survey (April 1993) showed 
that almost one-third of the respondents are looking into the 
possibility of starting their own business. Students of 
graduating classes in institutions of higher learning and 
vocational schools, engineers and technicians, and managers of 
state enterprises give this idea thought increasingly often. 
  The data used here should not be seen as a pretext for a 
total replacement of state property by private on the grounds 
that allegedly the entire population is leaning toward private 
business. First, while supporting the policy of privatization, 
the populace expresses no less support of state forms of 
ownership. Actually, state and collective forms of ownership 
enjoy a relatively greater public support than the private when 
it comes to major industrial enterprises, agricultural 
production, and health care and educational institutions. 
Second, a relative majority of the populace would prefer to see 
the national economy based on a mixed-economy model. This 
conclusion is supported by the answers of respondents to a 
somewhat artificial question: In your opinion, which form 
of ownership should be given preference in Russia?", posed 
in the all-Russia survey in November 1993 (in percents of the 
number of persons polled): 


------------------------------------------------------------------------------- 
|All equally                           |37                                    | 
------------------------------------------------------------------------------- 
|State                                 |24                                    | 
------------------------------------------------------------------------------- 
|Private                               |21                                    | 
------------------------------------------------------------------------------- 
|Collective, joint-stock holding       |16                                    | 
------------------------------------------------------------------------------- 
|No opinion                            |10                                    | 
------------------------------------------------------------------------------- 


  Even given the seeming "either/or" choice of answers to the 
question, people frequently chose not one but several forms of 
ownership, thus correcting the sociologists' error. Therefore, 
the sum of answers (taking into account those with no opinion) 
exceeds 100 percent. 
  According to respondents' replies, the main factor that 
prevents them from realizing their desire to engage in 
entrepreneurial activities is the lack of a start-up capital and 
experience. An equally significant barrier on the road to 
private enterprise (by the number of respondents who selected 
it) is the draconian tax policy. Keeping in mind the above, it 
would be interesting to see how this question was answered by 
experts--chiefs of regional (Russian Federation constituent 
republic, kray, and oblast) state tax services. These opinions 
were obtained through a sociological survey on 5 November 1992. 
Not much has changed in the tax policy since then; hence, the 
experts' opinion is still current. The survey included 54 chiefs 
of inspectorates, that is, most representatives of regional 
institutions of this particular state structure. This is how the 
replies were distributed (in percents of the number of persons 
polled): 


------------------------------------------------------------------------------- 
|In your opinion, to what extent is the current tax policy appropriate for th-| 
|e course of transition to a market?                                          |

|to the growth of business activities. Do you agree with this opinion?        |

  As we can see, more than half of state tax services' top 
officials, who are the conduit of tax policy, appraise its 
impact on entrepreneurial activities as negative. This is 
expressed not only in the tax policy's braking impact on the 
reform in a macroeconomic sense--exacerbating the paralysis of 
entrepreneurship, price hikes, creating incentives for the 
flight of capital abroad, etc. Taxation is the nerve of the 
economic organism that reaches individual people. The damage 
inflicted by the costs of taxation manifests itself in the 
deformation of stimuli and motivation of business activities of 
individual entrepreneurs and those who want to get into 
business. Because of high taxes, they tend to move their 
business into the sphere of the shadow economy. And quite 
successfully, which is evidenced, among other things, by the 
replies of top officials of tax inspectorates to the following 
questions (in percents of the number of persons polled): 


-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

|payment of taxes in the next year or two by the following entities:          |

  The burden of taxes coupled with the difficulties in leasing 
space to set up a business; bureaucratic obstacles to 
registering a private enterprise; racketeering; and some other 
unfavorable circumstances result in arrangements whereby private 
business often leads a parasitic existence on the back of state 
enterprises, and flourishes on corruption, machinations, and so 
on. 
  The processes of transformation of the Russian economy 
contribute to the development of secondary employment. The most 
important factor contributing to it is the emergence of 
different forms of ownership, which allows people to decide 
where and for what kind of money to work, and creates a certain 
competition between employers in the labor market. The 
development of secondary employment also is prompted to an equal 
degree by inflation and a decline in the population's standard 
of living, which prompts people to look for extra earnings. 
Finally, the third important factor in the development of 
secondary employment is associated with the people's desire to 
realize their abilities and aspirations. Private business 
provides them with this opportunity. 
  According to the data of the Russian Federation State 
Committee on Statistics [Goskomstat], the number of employees in 
the private sector of the economy increased over the period from 
1991 to March 1993 almost fourfold: from 4.9 million to 18.7 
million persons. These data are supported by the results of 
sociological surveys. For instance, according to the results of 
an all-Russia survey conducted in June 1993, 12 percent of the 
respondents were engaged in entrepreneurial activities and 
earned income from it. 
  Far from everyone engaged in the private sector of the 
economy, however, has severed their ties to state enterprises 
and institutions. Most continue to work in the state sector, and 
consider it their primary job that permits them to retain some 
social guarantees. 
  Secondary employment is not limited to combining work at 
state enterprises with work in the private sector. Quite often 
private entrepreneurs, too, do extra work at state enterprises. 
A survey conducted in June 1993 showed that 32 percent of 
workers have an additional income besides their income earned at 
the primary job. Naturally, the proportional share of persons 
who have a second job producing regular income varies 
considerably depending on socio-professional group. For 
instance, among workers of machine-building enterprises, 
communications, and a number of other sectors of the national 
economy, the share of such persons comprised 12-13 percent. At 
the same time, secondary employment for the purpose of earning 
additional income is very common among workers whose activities 
are not subject to a strict technological routine. 
  It is also interesting that the level of income from the 
main 
and secondary occupation among some categories of people often 
depends more on secondary income than income from the main job. 
Only for about one-half of those who have a second job is the 
extra income smaller than the main income. The rest (their 
proportional share comprised 14 percent of the total number of 
respondents in the all-Russia sample) have extra income that is 
equal to or even greater than that at the main place of 
employment. This factor requires separate consideration, since 
it is unclear how much time and energy is being expended on the 
second job as compared to the main one, whether taxes are paid 
on additional income, and so on. At the same time, one thing is 
clear--there exists a distortion in economic relations that 
undoubtedly affects management of production, moral and 
psychological climate in labor collectives, and attitude of 
hired labor to work. 
<H5>  Attitude Toward Labor </H5>
  Full-fledged implementation of the economic reform and 
mastering market mechanisms of the functioning of production 
assume not only a change in macroeconomic conditions, but also 
microeconomic preconditions for an economic upturn. Among the 
latter, of decisive importance is forming a new motivational 
core of labor activities, and overcoming alienation of labor. 
  Materials of representative surveys of workers, specialist 
cadres in the national economy, and other categories of the 
labor force conducted in different years by a comparative 
methodology provide some insight into the state of affairs. For 
instance, the question "Could you work better than 
now?" produced the following distribution of answers (in 
percents of the number of persons polled): 


Respondents' replies      Survey dates 

                          1986              1988              July 1993 

Of course I could         66                43                43

Not sure                  -                 -                 10 


  The facts show graphically that attempts to reform the 
economy through cosmetic measures during the period of 
perestroyka, and the subsequent fundamental change in the system 
of economic relations and administration equally failed to 
create conditions that would allow most workers to develop and 
realize their potential. 
  Naturally, the concrete causes and circumstances that compel 
people to work with half the effort are far from identical when 
comparing the past with the present. In the past, what stood in 
the way of professional self-realization was the preponderance 
of command-administrative methods of administration; now it is 
the disintegration of economic ties, supply, distribution of 
output, and so on. In the past, labor collectives frequently 
suffered from an end-of-the-period rush; now they are hurt by 
the impossibility of providing enough work for the people. For 
instance, according to Goskomstat data, about 3 million workers, 
or almost 5 percent of the total employed labor force, were sent 
on administrative leave at the administration's initiative over 
January-June 1993. In excess of another 1.5 percent were 
transferred to a shortened work week. 
  The unused available potential affects not only blue-collar 
workers, but also engineers and technicians, as well as the 
administrative staff. As during the years of economic 
stagnation, 73 percent of specialist cadres in the national 
economy surveyed in 1993 said that they work considerably below 
their capacity, that their abilities have been and remain unused. 
  There is no need to argue that a worker becomes a master of 
production in substance--not just in terms of being legally 
formalized--only when he is in a position to influence the 
management of production and has the right of vote in the 
distribution of profits. The full extent and breadth of 
participation in management is the most important indicator of 
change in economic relations and at the same time the main 
criterion of developing labor motivation that corresponds to the 
national economy. Theoretically, transferring state enterprises 
into joint-stock holding and giving them economic independence 
was supposed to accomplish precisely this. 
  Research conducted in 1993 at enterprises, half of which by 
then had been converted to joint-stock holding, showed, however, 
that trade unions as an institution of collective management 
have lost even the past minimal influence on the process of 
making principally important decisions. It is not accidental 
that only 23 percent of polled workers expressed the opinion 
that trade unions at their enterprises are capable of handling 
the tasks emerging in the environment of a free-market economy, 
and only 57 percent of the respondents supported unequivocally 
the preservation of trade unions. Also hardly reassuring is the 
fact that the proportional share of members of production 
collectives who attempt to influence the management of their 
enterprise does not exceed 10-15 percent. Even among them, 
however, a majority believes that the administration does not 
take into account the opinion of ordinary workers with respect 
to management of production. 
  A very important factor in attitude toward labor is the 
connection between the work done and wages. In the past this 
connection suffered from the chronic disease of leveling. As 
research showed, the system of material incentives with respect 
to labor of workers in mass professions has not improved. This 
very troubling circumstance is clearly seen from the answers to 
the question: "How will your wages change if you work 
better and more effectively at your enterprise? (in 
percents of the number of persons polled):

<H5>  Investment Orientation </H5>
  Production decline, the increase in past due arrears among 
enterprises, the instability of the financial market, 
continuously rising interest rates, and inflation all 
contributed to a protracted and steady worsening of the 
investment environment. According to expert opinion polls of 
chairmen of regional banks of the Savings Banks of Russia 
conducted in December 1992 and September 1993, even this bank, 
which possesses considerable financial resources, currently is 
not interested in investing in production. Its efforts are 
concentrated mainly on financing middlemen activities and 
deposits trading. Most respondents indicated that they readily 
issue credits mainly to commercial banks. Only 14 percent of 
chairmen of territorial savings banks indicated that their banks 
capitalize their assets by investing in individual enterprises. 
And even in that, only those who by virtue of their monopoly 
position earn superprofits. 
  The terms of credit and the tax policy, which make 
production 
of goods and services unprofitable, separate the banking and 
production capital. It is very rare even for relatively large 
banks to capitalize their assets through acquisition of 
enterprises' stock. 
  As banks' and enterprises' investment activities decline 
sharply, the population becomes increasingly prominent as an 
investor. This is caused by a number of circumstances. Among 
them are the availability of stocks for sale, a large-scale 
privatization of state property, and a high rate of inflation, 
which compels people to look for ways to protect their income. 
  Despite the fact that the nominal income of the population 
rises more slowly than consumer prices, some people attempt to 
set aside savings as insurance for the future. Given the modest 
degree of consumption on the part of most people, money 
accumulation in the hands of the population is quite 
substantial. According to specialists' expert estimates, the 
volume of cash in the hands of the population as of June 1993 
amounted to 1.037 trillion rubles [R], or 23 percent of the 
total population income. 
  An all-Russia survey conducted in June 1993 showed that a 
relative majority (38 percent) try to buy material things in 
order to salvage devaluing money; 16 percent put money in the 
banks into current and time-deposit accounts; and 9 percent 
acquire securities. Almost one-quarter of all of the population 
show interest in buying stock, especially enterprise directors, 
engineering and technical personnel, and people with 
sufficiently high income. 
  One of the factors shaping the investment orientation of the 
population are privatization vouchers. Numerous sociological 
surveys of Russia's residents provide evidence that most people 
are skeptical with respect to the real value of vouchers. 
  However, in those instances where voucher owners are able to 
exchange them for stock of enterprises where they work, their 
attitude toward the vouchers' buying capacity is quite 
respectful. At the same time, persons who find themselves placed 
in the disadvantageous position of depositors of privatization 
vouchers into investment funds often express negative attitude 
toward them. The proportional share of people in the latter 
category is considerably greater than the share of those who 
have an opportunity to participate in the privatization of their 
enterprises' property with the help of vouchers. 
  This factor represents one of significant reasons why many 
Russians are dissatisfied with the course of privatization. For 
instance, to the question "Are you satisfied with the way 
privatization is being implemented in Russia?" asked in an 
all-Russia survey of the population in November 1993, the 
replies were distributed as follows (in percents of the number 
of persons polled): 


------------------------------------------------------------------------------- 
|Yes, satisfied                        |3                                     |

|Not satisfied                         |34                                    |

------------------------------------------------------------------------------- 


  Despite massive advertising of investment funds in the mass 
media, so far they have been less than a success, since the 
proportional share of voucher owners who have not decided how to 
use them comprises about half of the adult population. Judging 
by the results of sociological surveys and the official data, by 
the end of 1993 only one-third of voucher holders had exchanged 
privatization vouchers for stocks of investment funds and 
enterprises or sold them for cash. 
  Research conducted at enterprises in Moscow, Stavropol Kray, 
and Nizhniy Novgorod and Tyumen Oblasts in the summer of 1993 
revealed the respondents' intentions as to how they plan to use 
their privatization vouchers. As it turned out, 38 percent of 
the respondents want to exchange them for their enterprises' 
stock; 10 percent, to exchange them for stock of other 
enterprises; 9 percent want to sell them; 8 percent, to exchange 
privatization vouchers for stock of investment funds; and, 
finally, 35 percent have not decided how they are going to use 
the vouchers or simply do not know what to do with them. 
  Thus, first, the bulk of the population remains a passive 
participant of voucher privatization; second, a contradictory 
situation exists: Most people do not wish to exchange vouchers 
for stocks of investment funds, but the rules of the "game" 
imposed on them are such that privatization funds are set up as 
practically the only possible agent available of most of the 
population in order to participate in the voucher-based 
privatization process. Confidence in investment funds and 
vouchers may rise only if these funds show more convincingly 
their connection to profitable enterprises. So far, however, 
this is not sufficiently taken into consideration in advertising 
and practical activities. 
  The sluggish advancement of the voucher-based privatization 
and the fact that most people place little value on 
privatization vouchers and have not decided what to do with them 
most likely will result in a mass surrender of them to the 
nearest investment fund on the eve of the deadline for 
exchanging vouchers for stocks. 
<H5>  Social Change: New Trends </H5>
  The social structure of the population, being a corollary of 
changes in the system of economic relations, nevertheless exerts 
a tremendous influence on the economy, defining to a large 
extent the algorithm of development of political processes and 
spiritual life. Therefore, it is crucially important to 
constantly evaluate transformations in the population's social 
structure, to identify the peculiarities of needs and interests 
of different social groups, clusters, and strata, and to study 
the mechanism of how social processes are interrelated with 
economic, political, and spiritual ones. 
  The difficulty of such analysis is in the absence of 
reliable, commonly accepted criteria and methodologies for 
defining social differentiation. For instance, in evaluating the 
population's standard of living, which is a constant subject of 
analysis by research institutes, state statistical organs, 
parties, and international organizations, no integral indicator 
has been found so far that would allow for the carrying out 
interregional and international comparisons with complete 
confidence. In addition, there exists an acute shortage of 
statistical information on real income and the level of 
consumption within different population groups. Finally, the 
socioeconomic situation in Russian society changes extremely 
rapidly. Many processes related to the social differentiation of 
the population are still at their initial stage. The scale and 
the pace of the rise in unemployment; formation of the 
securities market and groups of major securities holders; the 
development of private entrepreneurship in production rather 
than in the turnover sphere alone--these and other processes 
have not reached the degree of maturity that produces 
stabilization of the population's social structure. 
  It is precisely the instability of Russian society and the 
marginal (transitional) state of a considerable part of the 
population that determine the lack of predictability when it 
comes to expression of their will, the uncertainty of economic 
and political interests. For this reason in particular, 
political parties and movements cannot find a permanent social 
base, become a connecting link between the population and the 
state, acting as a supporting structure of the society's 
political system. 
  Naturally, the redistribution of property between different 
economic systems and subjects of economic relations is far from 
completed. That is why the picture of social stratification is 
so unstable. For instance, according to Goskomstat data, by the 
fall of 1993 more than 300,000 private farms had been set up, 
which, together with some other economic structures, comprised 
the private sector in agriculture. However, many private farms 
go out of business after being in existence for half a year or a 
year. Most of them are low-capacity and are not included in the 
profitable production of goods. People working on them belong to 
the group of individual proprietors more in terms of legal 
definitions than as subjects of economic relations. 
Nevertheless, they comprise a new population category, whose 
interests it is vitally important to take into account in the 
process of democratic transformations. 
  Most proprietors are currently recruited from among economic 
managers, who have considerable advantages with respect to 
participation in the privatization of property as compared to 
other population groups, as well as from among those engaged in 
trade, public catering, and consumer services, and partly from 
those employed in transportation, construction, and in the 
sphere of finances. The explanation for this is that middleman 
activities and trade provide the opportunity quickly to form and 
multiply private capital. 
  Although entrepreneurship on the basis of private property 
is 
developing fast, the proportional share of private enterprise 
owners remains relatively small. It comprises an estimated 5 
percent of the adult population. In industry and agriculture 
their share does not exceed 1-1.5 percent. Currently the 
fastest-growing segment is that of persons who own a certain 
share of property in the form of securities and at the same time 
work for hire. In this case we mean such owners of securities 
producing (or which will produce) sufficiently perceptible 
income. Judging by the data of sociological surveys, the 
proportional share of holders of stocks, bonds, or those who 
have enough untied money at their disposal to purchase such, 
comprises 6-7 percent. 
  The next social group in terms of size is that of 
high-income 
hired labor: persons working at joint, private, and cooperative 
enterprises, banks, insurance companies, and other structures 
which by reason of the economic state of the market are 
currently highly profitable. Their number reaches 12-15 percent 
of those engaged in the national economy. The situation of this 
category of persons is defined by the opportunity they have to 
turn into sufficiently major holders of securities or to start 
their own business. 
  The remaining four-fifths of the adult population work for 
hire at state enterprises and organizations, or are pensioners. 
It is unlikely that in the foreseeable future their social 
status will change for the better. Special attention should be 
paid to the part of the population who have found themselves 
socially dispossessed--several million refugees, forced 
migrants, chronically unemployed persons, and others. As a rule, 
they lose their social roots, become declasse, and have little 
chance of gaining wealth. 
<H5>  Stratification by Income </H5>
  Social stratification of the population defined by property 
relations is correlated--not completely, but to a large 
extent--with the differentiation of Russians by indicators of 
the level of their income and consumption. This is caused by the 
fact that frequently it is not the wage at the main place of 
employment but additional income, including that from owning 
property, that becomes the main factor in separating the 
population by the property attribute. 
  As of July 1993, classification of families by per capita 
income level looked this way (in percents of the number of 
surveyed families): 


------------------------------------------------------------------------------- 
|Rich families                         |1.5                                   | 
------------------------------------------------------------------------------- 
|Well-to-do families                   |5.5                                   | 
------------------------------------------------------------------------------- 
|Normal income families                |20                                    | 
------------------------------------------------------------------------------- 
|Low-income families                   |41                                    | 
------------------------------------------------------------------------------- 
|Poor families                         |32                                    | 
------------------------------------------------------------------------------- 


  (see: "The Standard of Living of the Population of Russia's 
Regions" No. 9, Moscow, 1993, p. 32) 
  A similar picture of differentiation by level of material 
well-being emerges from the results of sociological surveys. For 
instance, to the question "How do you appraise your 
standard of living?" the distribution of answers was as 
follows (in percents of the number of persons polled): 


                       June 1994        April 1993        November 1993 

I have everything I    2                3                 4 
need 

My living is quite     21               27                31 
acceptable 

I live from paycheck   52               41                44 
to paycheck 

I cannot make the      26               24                21 
ends meet, live in 
poverty 

No answer              -                5                 - 


  The following is of interest. Production volume declines; 
availability of goods and services decreases for a majority of 
the population because of shortages and high cost; the standard 
of living is falling steadily; nevertheless, the distribution of 
self-assessment of the level of material well-being is 
practically stable. Apparently, as the standard of living 
declines, people's perception of normal well-being also changes. 
They begin to settle for a minimal level of goods and services. 
For instance, according to data of a survey conducted in June 
1993, most people are unable to buy fruit and have excluded it 
from their nutrition ration. Nevertheless, most respondents 
believe that their standard of living is satisfactory. Almost 
one-half of the respondents note a steady worsening of their 
well-being and do not expect changes for the better in the next 
year or two. But this situation in a way has become the norm in 
their mind, something accustomed to and tolerable. Apparently, 
it is this lower level of expectations that holds the key to the 
fact that the bulk of the population is not inclined to engage 
in manifestations of social protest against a sharp decline of 
material conditions of life. 
  According to the Goskomstat and the Ministry of Labor data, 
approximately three-quarters of Russia's population may be 
regarded as low-income, including the 32 percent of Russians who 
in the middle of 1993 found themselves below the subsistence 
level. At the same time, about 3 million persons comprise the 
stratum of the super-rich. 
  The gap between the high- and low-income categories of 
people 
is steadily increasing. According to the data of budget surveys, 
in June 1993 the average per capita income in the top 10 percent 
income bracket exceeded by a factor of eight the respective 
level among the bottom 10 percent. 
  These are average figures, however. Among a considerable 
group of super-rich, the per capita income exceeds by a factor 
of tens or even hundreds the income of the poor. For instance, 
while on average the number of privately owned passenger cars in 
Russia amounts to 68 per 1,000 of population, among 
entrepreneurs one out of two owns a car. 
  While it is true that people now as a rule reject the old 
views on the state as a guarantor of a minimum package of goods, 
and despite the fact that they are against imposing limitations 
on honestly earned high income, the negative reaction in the 
public opinion to material polarization in the country is 
growing. It often manifests itself as discontent over unfairness 
in income distribution. The unfairness, in the opinion of 70-80 
percent of the respondents, is in that super-income is gained by 
abusing official position (corruption, machinations, and so on), 
swindling, and speculation. 
  Neither should we disregard a number of other negative 
social 
aspects of material stratification of the population. The 
low-income stratum comprises people working in the spheres of 
culture, education, science, and health care, as well as skilled 
specialists at enterprises producing defense items. The low cost 
of their labor is incommensurate with the level of prices for 
goods, services, and foodstuffs. This undermines the 
intellectual potential of the country and its capacity to 
rebuild itself. 
<H5>  Sources of Social Concerns </H5>
  The monitoring of social moods shows that there are many 
problems that cause public concern. The most acute among them 
are the impoverishment of the population, crime, and a number of 
others. This is graphically demonstrated by the distribution of 
the surveyed population's answers to the question: "What 
problems are of most concern to you?" (in percents of the 
number of persons polled):

  This list of problems is continually named by half or more 
of 
the surveyed population in the research conducted over the past 
three years. In addition, at least half of the respondents in a 
number of regions express concern over environmental pollution 
of their habitat by industrial waste. Between one-quarter and 
one-third of respondents in all-Russia surveys are alarmed over 
the loss of social guarantees with respect to health care, 
education, and organization of leisure. Many people in the past 
expressed concern over the negative consequences of the 
disintegration of the USSR; currently the threat of Russia's 
disintegration brings out an acute public reaction. 
  The integral indicator of the level of social concern caused 
by the lack of guarantees in the life of citizens and 
disintegration of the society is the fact that about one-third 
of the surveyed population consider the prospect of a civil war 
and famine in the country quite likely. 
  The constant social tension and uncertainty regarding the 
future makeup create a very unfavorable socio-psychological 
backdrop for labor activities, as well as demographic and other 
processes. The average life expectancy is declining; disease and 
mortality rates are rising; the birth rate is falling; 
interpersonal relations are breaking down; the role of historic 
traditions in forming the social outlook of new generations is 
being lost; the effect of ethical norms in social control and 
self-control of the people has been weakened. 
  Unemployment is becoming an increasingly weighty factor in 
the destabilization of the social situation. Its stress impact 
on Russian society and individual people who have lost their 
jobs so far has not been sufficiently studied. Meanwhile, as 
research conducted in Tomsk Oblast showed, the longer a person 
remains unemployed, the worse is his social well-being. The 
following results of a survey of unemployed persons provides 
convincing proof of this (in percents of the number of persons 
polled in each of the separate groups):

  The survey showed that the bulk of the population still 
count 
on the federal bodies of authority to find a way to prevent mass 
unemployment. In this, in the opinion of most enterprise 
directors and "ordinary" workers, the state's effort should 
concentrate mainly on solving two interconnected tasks: job 
creation and full-time retraining, aimed at utilizing people in 
new areas of production, the service sphere, and entrepreneurial 
activities. This logic, immaculate on the surface, unfortunately 
does not withstand the test of real life. 
  The creation of new jobs requires a considerable capital 
investment. Neither federal nor regional bodies of state 
authority have it at their disposal today. Neither do the 
overwhelming majority of enterprises, because of inflation and 
production decline. 
  The situation with respect to training and retraining of 
discharged labor force is no better. It is not clear what 
professions they should be trained in, given the 
across-the-board shrinkage of jobs. And does it make sense to 
set up a new system of personnel retraining at a time when it is 
impossible to assign graduates of institutions of higher 
learning and other educational institutions to jobs commensurate 
with their education? 
  The belief that the state will take care of the matter of 
providing jobs is fed by hopes that a structural restructuring 
of the national economy, and contraction of production in mining 
and other base sectors of production, as well as in the defense 
sector, will open greater opportunities for the development of 
the service sphere, which will absorb a considerable part of the 
released labor force. But the economic crisis has hurt first and 
foremost the social sphere. With all the "thirst" for various 
services, their physical volume in 1992 shrunk to 59 percent of 
their 1991 volume. 
  Enterprises have lost their former ability to finance their 
social infrastructure. The state also is withdrawing from the 
sphere of meeting the social needs of the population and is 
shifting it to a commercial basis. The level of its expenditures 
from the centralized budget on education, culture, art, and 
science is continually declining as compared to the pre-crisis 
period. Finally, privatization of trade, public catering, and 
consumer services enterprises, and commercialization of health 
care, culture, and education in the environment of a sharp 
decline of the population's ability to pay result in a 
considerable decline instead of increase in the demand for labor 
in the social sphere. According to survey data, it is precisely 
former workers in the sphere of service, health care, education, 
science, and culture who comprise the most numerous group of the 
unemployed in Tomsk Oblast. 
  Conventional wisdom holds that unemployment has provided a 
certain push toward the formation of the labor market, whose 
inalienable attribute is competition. Analysis shows, however, 
that, first, the shrinking of the labor force is not at all the 
result of the action of market mechanisms, and second, certain 
flashes of competition for jobs in essence differ little from 
queues for goods and foodstuffs, or waiting lists for housing in 
the environment of all-out shortages and producers monopoly. 
  For instance, 59 percent of workers in mass professions and 
28 percent of economic managers surveyed in Tomsk Oblast regard 
a shortened work week one of the most acceptable methods of 
minimizing production costs. One out of three workers and office 
workers expressed a willingness to take an unpaid leave to avoid 
being laid off. Also very widespread is the trend toward wage 
containment as a means of preserving jobs. 
  Increasing social stress is exacerbated by a forced mass 
migration of the Russian-speaking population from the former 
USSR republics and zones of interethnic conflicts in Russia. A 
hostile attitude of the local population to migrants will be 
increasing as the resources to meet the basic needs of the 
people--in food, housing, and other things--become increasingly 
scarce. This is already manifesting itself now. A factor worth 
noting is that a rather high percentage of respondents express a 
negative attitude on the issue of humanitarian aid to refugees. 
  An indicator of a conflict situation in the relationship 
between the local population and migrants rises sharply when the 
ethnic composition of migrants does not coincide with the title 
ethos in the places of their new settlement, since it is 
exacerbated by ethnic and language differences. In other words, 
mass migration is fraught with a "chain reaction" of interethnic 
conflicts. 
<H5>  Attitude to Social Guarantees </H5>
  Russia's painful transition from one type of socioeconomic 
and political system to a different one is predicated among 
other things on the problem of radical change in mentality, the 
difficulties of developing a new mechanism of interrelation 
between the economic and social spheres of the society, in 
particular, optimization of the criteria of effectiveness of 
economic and social development of the society. 
  It is this latter aspect of reforming the society that 
constitutes a cornerstone in the arguments of leading 
economists, politicians, parties, and movements regarding the 
programs, concrete scenarios, and the pace of market 
transformations, and the social costs, for instance, that the 
implementation of a monetarist economic policy will require. 
This aspect is brought to the forefront at the macrolevel in 
deciding on the issue of conversion of defense production and 
implementation of a structural reform in general, in solving the 
problem of cutting the state budget deficit, in working out the 
concept of social protection of the population, and so on. This 
aspect is no less topical at the microlevel, when the fate of a 
labor collective has to be decided during privatization of 
enterprises, in deciding on the fate of an unprofitable 
enterprise, and so on. 
  The disagreement in the approach to these problems between 
the executive branch and the disbanded soviets of people's 
deputies, between the Government of the Russian Federation and 
large socio-professional groups--miners, workers in the sphere 
of education and science, and so on, frequently result in 
intense conflicts, including mass strikes. 
  Of great importance in this connection is the study of the 
population's attitude to social guarantees, especially those 
among them that affect satisfaction of basic needs--housing, 
health care, child care, work, and a number of other. 
  In connection with the above, let us look at the results of 
two representative all-Russia population surveys conducted by a 
comparable methodology in December 1992 and April 1993. To the 
question "What is and what is not acceptable for you in 
the life of the new Russia?" the distribution of answers 
was as follows (in percents of the number of persons polled): 


               Acceptable          Unacceptable          Undecided 

               1992      1993      1992       1993       1992     1993

  Numerous control measurements of social attitudes carried 
out 
in regional surveys (in Tyumen and Tomsk Oblasts, Stavropol 
Kray, and others) showed the same picture as registered in the 
table above. The bulk of the Russian population support the 
development of economic and political freedoms. However (and 
this is quite natural) up to a point beyond which radical 
economic and political changes may jeopardize the people's 
existence. People see that for them freedom to trade turns into 
price hikes and the loss of public control over the quality of 
goods. 
  That the public opinion is right is confirmed by the results 
of an expert opinion poll of 58 heads of territorial 
administrations of consumer rights protection of the State 
Antitrust Policy Committee. For instance, most of them believe 
that the Russian Federation president's edict on the freedom of 
trade deprives them of the ability to control the quality of 
consumer goods and foodstuffs. To the question "To what extent 
is the law `On Consumer Rights Protection' complied with by 
sellers?" 55 percent of the experts responded that the law is 
complied with only in part, and 45 percent said it is not 
complied with at all. 
  Similarly unacceptable for the majority of the population is 
commercialization of health care and education. Unfortunately, 
this was not taken into account in drafting the new Constitution 
of the Russian Federation. 
  Decreasing budget appropriations for social needs are made 
up 
for to a certain extent by enterprises. This is seen graphically 
from the results of a survey of the population employed at 
enterprises in Moscow, Stavropol Kray, and Tyumen and Tomsk 
Oblasts. More than half of the respondents appraised as quite 
satisfactory the extent to which enterprises where they work 
provide them with public catering, arrange that foodstuffs and 
consumer goods are available for sale; 72 percent believe that 
enterprises do a lot with respect to providing them with medical 
services. More than two-thirds of the respondents said that 
enterprises should continue in the future their efforts in 
providing social services for their employees. At the same time, 
75 percent of the respondents do not relieve the government of 
the responsibility to provide social protection. 
<H5>  Going Back to the May Survey </H5>
  Below are the results of an all-Russia sociological survey 
conducted on 25-30 May 1993 
  The sample consisted of 1,500 persons representing 
proportionally the main socio-demographic and socio-professional 
groups of the population of 12 regions in the Russian Federation. 
  The respondents' replies are shown below in percents of the 
number of persons polled.

<H5>  The "Top" and the "Bottom" </H5>
<H5>  Political moods </H5>
  As a result of a breakdown of old social relations and 
debunking the ideology of socialism as a one-dimensional 
political and socioeconomic societal system, the mass 
consciousness of the Russians has become more open, perceptive 
to ideas of religious, ideological, political, and economic 
pluralism. However, the dying system of sociopolitical values 
and moral reference points has not been replaced and could not 
be fully replaced within such a short historic period by new, 
socially attractive and socially integrating ideas. A political 
and ethical vacuum has formed in the public consciousness. It is 
exacerbated by the information vacuum, since the periodical 
press has become unaffordable for many because of high cost and 
because public trust in mass media information is declining. 
  Many people have currently lost their reference points of 
political development of the society; their consciousness is 
being filled with pessimism, mysticism, expectations of social 
catastrophe, or, on the contrary, social miracle. An erosion of 
the people's moral qualities is taking place; social ties and 
immunity against ochlocracy are disintegrating. 
  At the same time, the tides of political struggle, clashes 
between the executive branch and the soviets of people's 
deputies, and two referendums that took place in 1993 force 
people to face the necessity of a political choice. At the same 
time, most people are inclined to base their political 
preferences not on specific political figures and their 
programs, which as a rule are little known. Most often the 
subject of political choice is the general direction of the 
country's socioeconomic development. 
  One can reconstruct on the basis of research materials the 
sociopolitical orientation of the population stemming from the 
answers to the question: "Which movements' ideas are 
closest to yours?" (in percents of the number of persons 
polled):

  As we can see, half of the population in answering this 
question showed political inertia. The attitude of others may be 
considered only as a potential base for movements of various 
orientations, but not as an electoral base of existing parties 
and their leaders. 
  Russians' political moods were "boosted" over two years by a 
struggle between the president's supporters and the disbanded 
deputy corps. Judging by materials of all-Russia population 
surveys, an advent of a "strong-hand" authority would rather 
please most citizens instead of causing concerns among them. 
While in April 1992, 38 percent of surveyed Russians expressed 
concern regarding the lack of authority in the country, seven 
months later, in December of the same year, it was 42 percent, 
and in April 1993--48 percent. People understand that as long as 
authority is impotent, it is hardly possible to count on 
stabilization of production, strengthening of law and order, and 
resolution of other problems. 
  In this situation the idea of strengthening the state 
authority through establishment of a presidential form of rule 
by constitutional methods always had a real chance for 
all-popular support. Using force as a method of resolving the 
problem of redistribution of powers between the executive and 
representative branches, on the other hand, never has been 
attractive to most people. It is not accidental that a survey of 
the Russian populace conducted in November showed that 58 
percent of the respondents saw the storming of the White House 
as a "national shame, in which both branches are at fault." 
<H5>  It Is Not Our Power </H5>
  The population's confidence in the renewed authority in 
Russia, which had emerged on the basis of democratization of the 
society, got lost as time went by. This has been caused both by 
exacerbation of the general crisis in the country and by 
miscalculations of state bodies and the policy they conducted. 
  For instance, one of the commonly accepted indicators of 
political alienation is how people see the extent of correlation 
between the decisions taken by the bodies of state 
administration and interests of the people. As numerous 
sociological surveys showed, more than 80 percent of the 
population do not have a clear idea of the substance of the 
policy conducted by the state and are convinced that the state 
does not care in any way about ordinary people and catering to 
their interests. 
  No less serious evidence of deepening political alienation 
is 
the increasing political apathy of the population, the loss of 
interest in political actions of all-national significance. As 
is known, 35.5 percent of Russian citizens refused to 
participate in the referendum on 25 April 1993. A survey 
conducted after the referendum showed that the subsequent sharp 
confrontation between federal bodies of executive and 
representative authority caused a negative reaction among the 
populace. Most people were disappointed that the bodies of 
authority used the results of the referendum to settle the score 
among themselves. 
  Sociological surveys show that, in the opinion of Russian 
citizens, the damage to the prestige of authority was inflicted 
by the following factors: 
  --the gap between promises and actual deeds, especially the 
fact that the promise to implement a radical economic reform 
without a catastrophic decline in the standard of living has not 
been kept; 
  --chaos in lawmaking, as a result of which the overwhelming 
majority of people are not aware of legal reference points; 
legal nihilism on the part of the population is increasing; 
  --a confrontation between the representative and executive, 
federal and local institutions of authority; 
  --bureaucratization of the apparatus of the bodies of state 
power and constant reshaping of power structures; 
  --corruption among state functionaries. 
  Of special interest is the population's attitude toward the 
Government of Russia. As had been the case with the government 
of the former USSR, it traditionally remained outside the field 
of attention of public opinion. For instance, only 10-15 percent 
of survey respondents expressed positive and 15-20 
percent--negative opinions of the work of governments headed by 
Ryzhkov, Pavlov, or Gaydar. Most Russian (between 40 and 60 
percent) did not have any firm opinion of this institution of 
state power at all. Similarly, most experts polled pointed out 
the vagueness of the government's actions, its tendency to cater 
to political trends. A serious argument indicating deficiency on 
the part of the government, from the standpoint of public 
opinion, also is that the population surveyed increasingly often 
expressed concern over the lack of authority in the country, 
explaining it not so much by political struggle as by atrophy of 
the system of state administration. 
  Despite a more proactive position of the government headed 
by 
V. Chernomyrdin, it also remained until lately on the periphery 
of public opinion. For instance, according to the data of an 
all-Russia opinion poll conducted in April 1993, 41 percent of 
respondents could not define their attitude to this government, 
its ability to deal with socioeconomic problems of the country. 
  Among the reasons that many people are ambiguous in their 
attitude toward the government is that within the system of 
power relations it traditionally appears as a conduit of state 
policy rather than its active principal. The principals in 
politics and the "masters" of the government had been the 
Politburo of the CPSU Central Committee, the presidents, the 
Supreme Soviets. 
  The disbandment of the Congress of People's Deputies and the 
Russian Federation Supreme Soviet dramatically changed the 
configuration of power relations at the federal level. There is 
currently an opportunity for the Government of Russia to move to 
the forefront of development and implementation of domestic and 
foreign policy in their organic unity. 
  One of the factors of alienation of power is the absence of 
a 
system of parties, which in industrially developed countries is 
the bulwark of the political system. Expert evaluations and the 
data of public opinion polls show that the stage of a rapid 
proliferation of political parties and movements in the country 
has been replaced by the phase of their crisis. This complicated 
considerably the creation of a civil society, the development of 
new statehood structures, stabilization of power, and general 
political situation. 
  Parties and political movements practically have not 
acquired 
the functions of ensuring the connection between citizens and 
the state and bringing them into active participation in 
political life. According to results of sociological surveys, 
about 60 percent of the adult population do not trust any 
parties. Only 4-5 percent of the respondents see them as 
institutions protecting the interests of the people. Only 2-3 
percent of the respondents believe that they need to participate 
in the activities of some or other party. The process of 
political demarcation in parties and movements is under way; 
they split into wings and factions. 
  This keeps them from developing into a political foundation 
of authority and leads to unpredictability of state 
administration, to constant reshuffling of power structures and 
cadres. Most respondents do not know in whose hands the 
authority is and note confusion in its actions. In reality, 
however, the powers of authority most often are appropriated by 
lobby groups. 
<H5>  The Connection Between Politics and the Economy </H5>
  Radical changes in a political system are impossible without 
a synchronous development and a close coordination of economic 
and political spheres. However, the loss of equilibrium between 
them, which began with the destruction of the 
directive-administrative system of public administration, is 
becoming increasingly pronounced. This begets a vicious circle, 
where the economy and the political-legal superstructure act as 
a brake on each other, which in turns bring about an escalation 
of social tension. Among miscalculations that have brought about 
this situation, the following deserve special attention. 
  The dismantling of the authoritarian-bureaucratic model 
of administration and noneconomic coercion once again is being 
carried out by the bureaucracy itself. 
  In the process, the bureaucracy itself is expanding sharply. 
It is merging increasingly actively with the shadow economy 
dealers. Sociological surveys show that arbitrariness of local 
bureaucracy is one of the main brakes of the people's 
entrepreneurial initiative. Up to 30 percent of population 
surveyed indicate this factor; most economic managers also 
complain about incompetent interference of authorities in 
economic activities. 
  Attempts to build a market economy are blocked by 
political decisions that splinter the economic space into 
fiefdoms or local organs of administration and break economic 
ties, as well as the weakness of the legal base for the 
functioning of the economy. 
  Legal regulation of the national economy on the basis of 
numerous administrative acts is virtually no different from the 
fallacious method of managing it by decisions of the politburo 
of the CPSU Central Committee and the USSR Council of Ministers. 
This practice only creates fertile soil for furthering corporate 
and departmental interests and leads to a legal chaos. 
  The overwhelming majority of the population surveyed are not 
aware of the normative acts that are being adopted. More than 50 
percent of specialist cadres note great difficulties stemming 
from legislative confusion. 
  The measures aimed at overcoming the paralysis of power 
do not produce any visible success, because they are aimed not 
so much at establishing a solid echelon of support in the form 
of parties, social movements, and interested population strata 
as they are at forming new authoritarian structures. 
  Democratic movements increasingly often distance themselves 
from authority. Former CPSU members, who, because of historic 
circumstances, represent the best-trained part of the population 
(skilled workers, the technical, scientific, and artistic 
intelligentsia, and others) are placed in the position of 
opposition to the policy of transformation. Contrary to 
objective need for civic consolidation, members of the ruling 
authority often provoke political, social, and economic 
squabbles, which choke the reforms. 
  The authoritativeness, and therefore the ability to 
act, of authority are being undermined by farfetched promises to 
stabilize the economy within the next few months. 
  People's social experience tells them that this kind of 
populism is either the result of impatient self-assurance of the 
administrators or, which is worse, a deception. Despite all 
reassurances, there is growing anxiety and mass discontent over 
the protracted turmoil and unfulfilled expectations of change 
for the better: Ninety percent of the population surveyed do not 
believe that life will improve within the next year or two. 
  For the sake of minimizing the losses in the process of 
state 
administration, the following are of considerable importance: 
  --creation of more effective "feedback" that will allow the 
bodies of authority to receive timely information on the extent 
of the social well-being of the population, on developing 
conflict situations, on the effectiveness of social 
administration, and others; 
  --changing the structures of executive authority in order to 
overcome parallelism in their work and reducing 
bureaucratization (currently, for instance, quite a few 
difficulties arise in the interaction between the president's 
representatives in the regions and oblast and kray 
administrations, in the interaction between the president's 
administration and the government, and so on); 
  --clarifying the powers and the spheres of influence of the 
leadership and members of the government, whose actions and 
political maneuvers may be on a collision course with the 
priorities of the government program of leading the country out 
of the crisis. Especially unpleasant consequences are brought 
about by attempts of the government's structural units to 
provide a sort of "targeted" support to enterprises and 
individual sectors of the economy (and the people working 
there), substituting these measures for activities aimed at 
creating a common free-market economic space, the same for all 
producers. The practice of granting economic preferences, credit 
on favorable terms, and such only exacerbates monopolism, 
fosters corruption, and feeds subjectivism in state 
administration.
