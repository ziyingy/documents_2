KVAERNER, the Norwegian engineering group which recently won two big
shipbuilding and offshore platform orders, yesterday announced pre-tax
profits ahead at NKr434m (Dollars 62m) in the first four months, compared
with NKr424m the year previously.
The improvement was due to sharply increased profits in its oil and gas
division, which rose to NKr135m from NKr87m, offsetting reverses in
shipbuilding, pulping technologies and shipping, and a loss in mechanical
engineering. Net earnings per share slipped from NKr8.15 to NKr7.24.
Group sales rose 25 per cent to NKr7.8bn from NKr6.2bn, fuelled by a steep
rise in oil and gas division sales, from NKr1.67bn to NKr2.33bn, and the
acquisition of the German shipyard Kvaerner Warnow Werft.
Kvaerner, Norway's biggest private company, was buoyed in April by its
biggest-ever orders - one worth NKr6.5bn for four liquefied natural gas
carriers from Abu Dhabi and a NKr1bn contract for engineering and
construction work on a new North Sea gas platform. These lifted orders in
the four months to NKr14.02bn from NKr6.54bn in the same period last year.
Group order backlog at end-April was NKr33bn.
Kvaerner expects full-year profits to be in line with last year's pre-tax
result of NKr932m.
Metsa-Serla, the Finnish forestry group, said yesterday it had increased its
share issue launched last week to 3.25m shares from 3m following heavy
over-subscription for what is one of the chief international issues by a
Finnish company since the country slumped into recession two years ago. The
total raised was FM542.75m (Dollars 100.5m).
