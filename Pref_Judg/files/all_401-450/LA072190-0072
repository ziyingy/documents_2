<P>
In a gesture that could be worth more in politics than in dollars, Gov. George 
Deukmejian on Friday reduced his budget-cutting plan by $60 million, agreeing 
instead to a pair of less controversial legislative proposals that would save 
the same amount. 
</P>
<P>
Although the move hardly makes a dent in the $3.6-billion spending gap that has 
stalled progress on a state budget for three weeks, the health and social 
service cuts abandoned by the Republican chief executive were among the most 
contentious on his list of program reductions. 
</P>
<P>
Deukmejian said he no longer would press to eliminate a program that trains 
children to guard against child abuse, and he said he would retain 28 centers 
that help disabled people live on their own. 
</P>
<P>
The governor's proposal to eliminate the child-abuse program had angered its 
creator, Assemblywoman Maxine Waters (D-Los Angeles), a powerful member of the 
Assembly's budget-writing committee. Deukmejian's proposed elimination of the 
independent living centers had attracted dozens of disabled protesters to his 
Capitol office, including 35 who were arrested there earlier this week. 
</P>
<P>
Deukmejian also dropped proposals to eliminate the state's Alzheimer's disease 
diagnostic centers and a program to train health professionals to serve 
minority and low-income areas. And he said he would agree to higher payments to 
families caring for foster children. 
</P>
<P>
The legislative proposals the governor accepted included a change in the way 
the state contributes to the teachers' retirement system, which would save $50 
million next year, and a plan to cut $10 million from payments to local 
redevelopment agencies. 
</P>
<P>
Both proposals were overwhelmingly approved by the Assembly on Thursday even as 
Republicans in the lower chamber were rejecting a Democrat-drafted 
$55.4-billion spending plan, which was balanced with the help of $1.3 billion 
in new taxes and fees. Although the state is now a record 21 days into the 
fiscal year without a budget, no further action on the issue is expected before 
Monday. 
</P>
<P>
"I have said all along that if the Legislature didn't like specific spending 
reductions and reforms I have proposed, I would consider alternate proposals, 
provided that they produce real savings and budgetary reform," Deukmejian said 
in a statement released by his office. 
</P>
<P>
Assemblywoman Waters described as "great news" Deukmejian's agreement to retain 
the child-abuse prevention program she started. 
</P>
<P>
"These are very small programs but they're very important because they address 
very important needs," she said. "It makes me feel a helluva lot better." 
</P>
<P>
Democratic Assemblyman John Vasconcellos of Santa Clara, chairman of the Ways 
and Means Committee, said the governor's action was a "move in the right 
direction." 
</P>
<P>
"It's a modest beginning," Vasconcellos said. "The proposed elimination of 
those programs was so stupid and obnoxious that it's nice to have him recognize 
his own errors." 
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, after successful legal action on behalf of welfare recipients and 
health care providers, state employees who have already gone without one 
paycheck and are in danger of missing another turned to the courts for relief 
Friday. 
</P>
<P>
Unions representing most of the state's 190,000 employees announced they were 
filing suit in federal and state court to force the state to meet a forthcoming 
$500-million end-of-the-month payroll. 
</P>
<P>
The legal action also seeks to free a $6-million payroll for 7,800 employees of 
the Legislature and the Department of Transportation that the state missed 
earlier this month. About two dozen Caltrans workers staged a noisy protest 
Friday at the Capitol, shouting "Nuke the Duke" and carrying signs saying "When 
is Payday?" 
</P>
<P>
"Our members are suffering drastic repercussions as a result of this completely 
frustrating political situation," said William A. Biggs, president of the 
Alliance of Trades and Maintenance, which represents the Caltrans workers. "We 
have received a multitude of phone calls from highway workers in drastic 
situations. Power is being shut off to their houses. Eviction notices are being 
served. Some employees are being threatened with going to jail for non-payment 
of child support." 
</P>
<P>
Controller Gray Davis is prohibited by the California Constitution from meeting 
any of the state's financial obligations until the Legislature approves a state 
budget. 
</P>
<P>
But during the last week, court rulings have freed $149 million in welfare 
funds, $489 million for Medi-Cal and $50 million for in-home care workers. Two 
federal judges have held that the state has no right to stop paying for those 
programs, which are jointly funded by the state and federal governments. 
</P>
<P>
The state employees hope the courts also will force the state to mail their 
paychecks on the grounds that non-payment would be a violation of federal labor 
laws. Lawsuits by the Caltrans workers' union and the California State 
Employees Assn., representing 95,000 workers, will probably be heard in U.S. 
District Court here early next week. Pat McConahay, a spokeswoman for the CSEA, 
said state workers need a legal ruling by the end of next week for the checks 
to go out on time.
