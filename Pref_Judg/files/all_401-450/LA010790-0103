The Osteoporosis Medical Center, a nonprofit research, diagnostic and treatment 
facility in Beverly Hills, is seeking women to participate in a national study 
of the effectiveness of calcitonin nasal spray in preventing osteoporosis. 
</P>
<P>
The study, which is being conducted in conjunction with UCLA Medical Center, 
will look at how effective calcitonin in nasal spray form is in preventing bone 
loss in the spine, hips and other parts of the body. 
</P>
<P>
Earlier studies in England have shown the spray to prevent loss of bone density 
in the spine. Calcitonin has been approved by the Food and Drug Administration 
for use in injectable form.

Center physician Stuart Silverman explained that estrogen is known to protect 
against bone density loss after menopause, but that estrogen presents problems 
for some women. He said that up to one-third of women do not respond to 
estrogen therapy. Others should not take estrogen because of health problems, 
including ovarian cancer, fibrocystic disease and other conditions. 
</P>
<P>
To be eligible to take part in the study, volunteers need to have reached 
menopause within the past five years. Interested women may visit the center, at 
450 North Bedford Drive, or call (213) 274-0111.
