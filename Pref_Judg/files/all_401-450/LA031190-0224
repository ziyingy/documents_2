On the Wild Side: My idea of a vacation is to download the stress circuits. I 
don't want to be up at dawn boarding a bus or scaling a mountain. Give me a 
peaceful beach. Or a grassy meadow with the voice of the wind humming through a 
forest. But my particular formula doesn't satisfy everyone. A growing number of 
vacationers are seeking the active life. Which is why Rock Creek Pack Station 
in Bishop, Calif., is busy taking reservations. The idea at Rock Creek is to 
track wild mustangs. A Western adventure in the Inyo National Forest. "All you 
need is a bed roll," says Dave Dohnel of Rock Creek. "We supply the rest." At 
Rock Creek, vacationers work as ranch hands and join annual horse drives 
(spring and fall). Other Rock Creek wranglers lead trail rides and pack trips 
during summer months into John Muir, Golden Trout and Ansel Adams Wildernesses, 
Yosemite and Sequoia/Kings Canyon National Parks.
