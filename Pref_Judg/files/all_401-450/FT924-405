THE BANK accounts of Lynx, the animal rights group that campaigned against
fur farming, were yesterday ordered to be frozen by the High Court. The
order came after Lynx lost a libel case and was unable to pay damages and
costs.
A High Court jury decided that the group, in literature circulated to MPs,
had wrongly accused Swalesmoor fur farm, near Halifax, West Yorkshire.
Damages of Pounds 40,000 were awarded, along with costs put at over Pounds
100,000.
Mr Mark Glover, a founding director of Lynx, said it expected a winding-up
order to be sought against it.
