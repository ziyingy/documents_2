3. Applicants seek on order, which will supersede the Prior Orders, to allow the Funds to issue and sell up to four classes
of shares pursuant to a multiple distribution system (the ``Multiple Distribution System''). Under the requested
order, applicants may offer (i) ``Class A'' shares sold subject to a conventional front-end sales load and a rule 12b&hyph;1
fee which includes a service fee and, under certain circumstances, a CDSC; (ii) ``Class B'' shares sold subject to
a CDSC (for a period typically within a range of three to six years) and a rule 12b&hyph;1 fee which includes a service
fee; (iii) ``Class C'' shares sold subject to a rule 12b&hyph;1 fee which includes a service fee and a CDSC; and (iv)
a class of shares (the ``Class Y'' shares) to be offered and sold without any front-end sales load, CDSC or rule 12b&hyph;1
fee payable by the Fund. Class Y shares will be sold to certain types of investors, including certain institutional
investors, as described in a Fund's prospectus.

4. Each of the four classes of shares will represent interests in the same portfolio of investments of a Fund. Each of
the four classes of shares will be identical except that

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(i) the rule 12b&hyph;1 fees (which include a service fee within the meaning of Article III, Section 26 of the Rules
of Fair Practice of the National Association of Securities Dealers (``NASD'') (``service fee'')) payable by the
Fund to Distributor will be higher for Class B and Class C shares than they will be for Class A shares; 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(ii) the transfer agency costs attributable to each class may differ; 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(iii) each class may bear different Class Expenses, as defined in condition 1 below;

Class expenses include fees under a non-rule 12b&hyph;1 shareholder services plan. None of the Funds currently has
adopted a non-rule 12b&hyph;1 shareholder services plan. Any such plan adopted in the future would comply with condition
16 below.

(iv) the four classes will have different exchange privileges; 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(v) only Class B shares will have a conversion feature; and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(vi) each affected class of shares will vote separately as a class with respect to the Fund's rule 12b&hyph;1 plan and
on other matters for which separate class voting is appropriate under applicable law; provided that, if the Fund submits
to a vote of both the Class A shareholders and the Class B shareholders an amendment to the Fund's rule 12b&hyph;1 plan
that would materially increase the amount to be paid thereunder with respect to the Class A shares, the Class A shareholders
and the Class B shareholders will vote separately by class. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
5. The distribution structure for all classes of shares will comply with the applicable NASD Rules of Fair Practice
relating to sales charges, including front-end, deferred and asset-based sales charges. Additionally, any service
fees paid by the Funds will meet NASD requirements for the imposition of a service fee. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
6. All Class B shares of the Funds will automatically convert to Class A shares a certain number of years after the end
of the calendar month in which the shareholder's order to purchase was accepted. Such number of years, which will depend
on the conversion schedule that applied at the time the Class B shares were originally purchased, may be up to eight.
Shares purchased through the reinvestment of dividends and other distributions in respect of Class B shares will
be treated as Class B shares for purposes of the higher rule 12b&hyph;1 fee. However, for purposes of conversion to
Class A shares, all shares in a shareholder's account which are purchased through the reinvestment of dividends and
distributions paid in respect of Class B shares (and which have not converted to Class A shares as provided in the following
sentence) will be considered held in a separate sub-account. Each time any Class B shares in the shareholder's account
(other than those in the sub-account referred to in the preceding sentence) convert to Class A shares, an equal pro
rata portion of the Class B shares in the sub-account will also convert to Class A shares. The conversion of Class B to
Class A shares may be suspended if the opinion of counsel obtained by the Funds that the conversion does not constitute
a taxable event under current federal income tax law is no longer available.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
7. Adviser or Distributor may choose to reimburse or waive rule 12b&hyph;1 fees, transfer agency costs or any Class
Expenses on certain classes on a voluntary, temporary basis. The amount of rule 12b&hyph;1 fees, transfer agency
costs or any Class Expenses waived or reimbursed by Adviser or Distributor may vary from class to class. Rule 12b&hyph;1
fees, transfer agency costs and any Class Expenses are by their nature specific to a given class and obviously expected
to vary from one class to another. Applicants thus believe that it is acceptable and consistent with shareholder expectations
to reimburse or waive rule 12b&hyph;1 fees, transfer agency costs or any Class Expenses at different levels for different
classes of the same Fund. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
8. In addition, Adviser or Distributor may waive or reimburse Fund expenses (with or without a waiver or reimbursement
of rule 12b&hyph;1 fees, transfer agency costs or any Class Expenses) but only if the same proportionate amount of
Fund expenses are waived or reimbursed for each class. Thus, any Fund expenses that are waived or reimbursed would
be in turn credited to each class of shares of the Fund based on the relative net assets of the classes. Fund expenses
apply equally to all classes of a Fund. Accordingly, it may not be appropriate to waive or reimburse Fund expenses at
different levels for different classes of a Fund. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
9. Adviser's or Distributor's ability to effect any of the waivers or reimbursements described above is subject to
the Funds' receipt of a ruling of the Internal Revenue Service that the effecting of such waivers or reimbursements
does not result in any Fund's dividends or distributions constituting ``preferential dividends'' under the Internal
Revenue Code. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
10. Under the Multiple Distribution System, each of the four classes may be given exchange privileges. Shares of each
class generally will be permitted to be exchanged only for shares of a class with similar characteristics in another
Fund. Class Y shares of a Fund may be exchangeable for Class Y shares of other Funds and shares of certain money market
funds sponsored by Adviser. If the aggregate net asset value of shares of all Funds held by an investor reaches the minimum
amount at which an investor in a Fund may purchase Class A shares of the Fund at net asset value without a front-end sales
load or more on or before December 15 in any year, all Class B or Class C shares of the Fund held by the investor may be exchanged,
at the investor's request, at net asset value, without any front-end sales load or CDSC, for Class A shares of the Fund.
All exchanges that are made at other than relative net asset values of the respective securities to be exchanged will
be made in accordance with rule 11a&hyph;3.
