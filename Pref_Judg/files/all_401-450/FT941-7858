The Church of England will have women priests from next month following
final approval of legislation by its general synod yesterday.
More than 1,000 women deacons are likely to seek ordination to the
priesthood during the coming year now the final legislative hurdle has been
overcome. The first ordinations will take place in Bristol cathedral on
March 12.
Yesterday's decision by the synod concluded a legislative process that has
been in progress for more than five years. Some male clergy and lay people
are leaving the church over the decision.
After the synod's move Dr George Carey, archbishop of Canterbury, urged all
members of the church to unite in proclaiming the gospel 'to a world in
need.' He recognised that some who were opposed to the legislation would
regard the decision with regret. 'To many more, this is a moment for
rejoicing in the confident expectation of the rich and diverse gifts women
will bring to the priestly ministry.'
Several other provinces of the worldwide Anglican communion, including the
Church of Ireland, already have women priests.
