Contaminants which contribute to poor indoor air quality can be attributed to both outside air and inside air. Outside
air contaminants can be introduced into a building through the ventilation intakes, doors, building envelope, and
windows. Outside air contaminants include vehicular exhausts, industrial emissions, microbiologicals, and pollen.
Inside air contaminants are emitted from building materials and furnishings, appliances, office equipment and
supplies, biological organisms, and of course, pollutants introduced by the building occupants themselves. Inside
air contaminants include tobacco smoke, volatile organic compounds, combustion gases such as carbon monoxide,
and occupant-generated bioeffluents. The concentration of these contaminants in buildings can increase if ventilation
systems are inadequately designed, maintained and operated or if strong local contaminant sources are not controlled.

A. Sources of Indoor Air Contaminants 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
A wide variety of substances are emitted by building construction materials and interior furnishings, appliances,
office equipment, and supplies, human activities, and biological agents. For example, formaldehyde is emitted
from various wood products, including particle board, plywood, pressed-wood, paneling, some carpeting and backing,
some furniture and dyed materials, urea-formaldehyde insulating foam, some cleaners and deodorizers, and from
press textiles. Volatile organic compounds, including alkanes, aromatic hydrocarbons, esters, alcohols, aldehydes,
and ketones are emitted from solvents and cleaning compounds, paints, glues, caulks, and resins, spray propellants,
fabric softeners and deodorizers, unvented combustion sources, dry-cleaning fluids, arts and crafts, some fabrics
and furnishings, stored gasoline, cooking, building and roofing materials, waxes and polishing compounds, pens
and markers, binders and plasticizers. Pesticides also contain a variety of toxic organic compounds.

Building materials are point sources of emissions that include a variety of VOCs (Table III&hyph;1). Some of these
materials have been linked to indoor air quality problems. The probability of a source emitting contaminants is related
to the age of the material. The newer the material, the higher the potential for emitting contaminants. These materials
include adhesives, carpeting, caulks, glazing compounds, and paints [Ex. 4&hyph;33]. These materials, as well
as furnishings can act as a sponge or sink in which VOCs are absorbed and then re-emitted later. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Appliances, office equipment, and supplies can emit VOCs and also particulates [Ex. 4&hyph;33]. Table III&hyph;2
lists the many contaminants that can be emitted from these point sources. There is an indirect relationship between
the age of the point source and the potential rate of contaminant emission [Ex. 4&hyph;33].
