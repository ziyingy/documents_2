<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
 (a) The operator is in physical possession of enough tickets for admission to the event to provide such tickets for

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
 (b) The operator has entered into a written contract with an organization that is the distributor of such tickets or
an organization that receives such tickets directly from the distributor (e.g., a bowl committee; football conference,
league or team; concert promoter or arena; etc.), the terms of which provide for that organization to furnish the operator
enough admission tickets to provide such tickets for a substantial number of seats on the tour; or

(a) Except as provided in paragraph (b) of this section: 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
 (1) No operator of a Special Event Tour shall accept money for a seat on a Special Event Tour, or authorize an agent to
accept such money, unless the operator has physical possession of, or written contracts (in the manner described
in &sect;381.7) for, a ticket for admission to the event for that individual. To the extent that the operator receives
an unsolicited booking for which the operator does not have physical possession of or written contracts for a ticket
for admission to the event, any payment accompanying that booking must be returned within 3 business days. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
 (2) Upon acceptance of the money for a sale, the operator must reserve one event ticket for that individual. An operator
may not sell more seats on the tour than it has event tickets in hand or under contract. (An operator need not continue
to reserve an event ticket for an individual who withdraws from the tour by providing notice to the operator or by being
notified by the operator that the individual's participation has been canceled due to failure to remit a required
installment payment.) 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
 (b) An operator of a Special Event Tour may accept a booking and payment from an individual for whom the operator does
not have an event ticket in hand or under contract if that individual agrees in writing that he or she understands that
no event ticket has been reserved for him or her. This agreement shall specify whether the person has agreed to participate
in the tour without an event ticket and/or the operator has agreed to attempt to acquire an event ticket for this person.
If the two parties agree that the operator will attempt to acquire an event ticket, the agreement shall specify any
penalties that will apply if the individual later cancels because an event ticket did not become available. If the
operator notifies this person that an event ticket has become available, that person shall enjoy all the other protections
of this part from that time.
