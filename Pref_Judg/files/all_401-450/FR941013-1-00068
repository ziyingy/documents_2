<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
For the off-site waste and recovery operations source 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
category, the EPA decided to adapt the definition of ``waste'' 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
adopted for the benzene waste operations NESHAP (40 CFR 60 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
subpart FF). Based on this definition, the EPA created 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
separate terms for ``waste'' and ``recoverable materials'' to be 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
used for the off-site waste and recovery operations NESHAP. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
For this rulemaking, the EPA is proposing to define ``waste'' 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
as any material generated from industrial, commercial, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
mining, or agricultural operations or from community 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
activities that is discarded, discharged, or is being 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
accumulated, stored, or physically, chemically, thermally, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
or biologically treated prior to being discarded or 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
discharged. The EPA is proposing to define ``recoverable 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
material'' for this rulemaking as any material generated from 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
industrial, commercial, mining, or agricultural operations 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
or from community activities that is recycled, reprocessed, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
reused, or is being accumulated, stored, or physically, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
chemically, thermally, or biologically treated prior to 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
being recycled, reprocessed, or reused. Based on these 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
definitions, materials affected by this rulemaking include 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
those materials determined to be hazardous wastes under the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
RCRA rules, solid wastes that are not hazardous wastes under 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
RCRA rules, and secondary materials such as used, surplus, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
and scrap materials that are either recycled for recovery of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
reusable materials or reprocessed for sale as new products.

B. Subcategorization 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Subcategorization of a source category is sometimes 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
appropriate for a rulemaking when industrial segments within 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
a source category require application of different types of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
control techniques. In developing today's proposed rule, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the EPA considered subcategorization of the off-site waste 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
and recovery operations source category and decided not to 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
propose subcategories for the off-site waste and recovery 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
operations NESHAP. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
As described in section III.B of this notice, the EPA 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
identified several different industrial segments to be 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
included in the off-site waste and recovery operations 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
source category. Most of these off-site waste and recovery 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
operations facilities are also hazardous waste TSDF (refer 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
to section III.C of this notice). However, the quantity and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
type of organic HAP emissions from an off-site waste and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
recovery operations facility are not dependent upon whether 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
a particular facility is subject to RCRA hazardous waste 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
management rules. As previously described, off-site waste 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
and recovery operations facilities can receive materials 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
that are not hazardous wastes under the RCRA rules but still 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
contain organics listed as HAP under CAA section 112(b). 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Furthermore, common organic HAP control technologies are 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
applicable to the operations used at all of the off-site 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
waste and recovery operations facility types. There are no 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
significant differences in the organic HAP emissions or the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
control technologies applicable to controlling these 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
emissions from any of the off-site waste and recovery 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
operations facility types. Thus, based upon these factors, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the EPA concluded that designation of separate subcategories 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
for the purpose of developing the off-site waste and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
recovery operations NESHAP is not warranted.

C. Selection of Emission Points

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
For purpose of developing regulatory alternatives which 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
could be effectively compared in developing this rulemaking, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the EPA identified the predominate types of emissions points 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
at off-site waste and recovery operations facilities where 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
organic HAP emissions occur. Five emission point type 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
classifications were designated as follows: tanks, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
containers, land disposal units, process vents, and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
equipment leaks.
