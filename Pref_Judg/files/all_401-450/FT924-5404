JAPAN'S leading commercial banks, although announcing an embarrassing fall
in profits and a leap in loan loss reserves yesterday, could take some
comfort that their balance sheets were generally less unsightly than those
of the country's seven trust banks.
The banks' miserable results for the first half to September reflected the
new-found determination of the banking industry and the Japanese government
to clean away the debris from the stock and property market collapse.
As a result, the 11 commercial banks yesterday confessed to large securities
appraisal losses and a non-performing loan problem that required, on
average, a 42 per cent increase in loan loss reserves.
However, the seven trust banks deferred booking securities losses until the
year-end in March. On present reckoning, appraisal losses would have pushed
five into the red, with only Mitsubishi Trust and Banking and Sumitomo Trust
and Banking strong enough to take the hit and make a profit.
The banks were fortunate that a decline in interest rates during the period
allowed them to book sharply higher business profits, creating a cushion for
the new provisions and saving them the embarrassment of reporting a loss.
At Mitsubishi Bank, for example, interest received on its loans fell by 24.9
per cent, while interest payments on deposits were down 35.1 per cent. The
difference contributed to a 32.8 per cent increase to Y277.6bn (Dollars
2.2bn) in net interest income, the primary component of core earnings.
The banks realise that they cannot expect another 1 per cent to 2 per cent
fall in rates in the next half, and concede that their balance sheets will
be under more pressure.
'In the current environment, the stress that Mitsubishi Bank has
traditionally placed on credit review and asset quality control has taken on
renewed significance. Additional measures included upgrading systems and
procedures for risk rating and exposure control,' the bank said.
Japanese industrial companies take the stress on asset quality control by
Mitsubishi and other banks as a warning that it will be more difficult for
them to get loans over the next year. The finance director of a leading
Japanese steelmaker said yesterday his company had no trouble in borrowing
from banks, but that any industrial company with a record of speculation in
stocks or property faces great difficulty in getting funds.
While the banks are cautious in new lending and withdrawing from some
international projects, most said that their gross profits on international
business increased during the period. Fuji Bank said these profits rose 2.5
per cent, and Sanwa Bank reported a 37 per cent increase.
Sanwa has taken the title of Japan's most profitable bank from Sumitomo
Bank, as the former recorded a business profit of Y198.6bn and a net profit
of Y40.2bn, while Sumitomo had profits of Y175.9bn and Y37.8bn respectively.
Even Sanwa is struggling to reduce costs. The bank reported general and
administrative expenses of Y165.4bn, up from Y156bn in the first half last
year, suggesting that deeper cuts in personnel may be needed in coming
months.
Sanwa has cut its graduate intake, but it and other leading banks may be
forced to cut the workforce over the next year and review operations.
Pressure for cuts is particularly extreme at the trust banks, which have a
far thinner cushion of profits even though the restructuring of the banking
system is only just beginning. Mitsui Trust and Banking reported a net
profit of Y9.5bn, down 34.1 per cent, without taking a stock appraisal loss,
while Nippon Trust Bank had a net profit of Y1.1bn, down 47.3 per cent.
The seven trust banks were more modest in increasing their loan loss
reserves, which rose by a total of 26.5 per cent to Y35.8bn. Like the
commercial banks, the trust banks all managed to save face by keeping their
capital adequacy ratios well above the 8 per cent level required by next
March.
