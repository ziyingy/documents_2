Progress towards answering the biggest questions in science - about the
origins and future of the universe - depends ultimately on a partnership
between scientists working on unimaginably different scales of time and
distance. Astronomers and cosmologists are observing and trying to
understand events that occurred billions of years ago and billions of light
years away; at the other extreme, particle physicists are investigating
collisions lasting billionths of a second on a scale of billionths of a
millimetre.
But the two types of scientist enter 1994 in very different moods.
Cosmologists are in a frenzy of excitement, fed by observations from space
and from ground-based instruments, as they weave new theories about the
cosmic boom that brought the universe into existence 15bn years ago. Their
sense of anticipation is heightened by last month's repair of the Hubble
telescope, which will enable astronomers to see further into space.
Particle physicists, in contrast, are mourning a terrestrial bust. Pressure
from congressional budget cutters forced the US to cancel what would have
been their most powerful instrument - the Dollars 10bn Superconducting Super
Collider (SSC) - after spending Dollars 2bn digging the first section of its
85 km tunnel beneath the plains of Texas.
October's SSC cancellation not only deprives physicists of a means of
smashing together elementary particles at energies high enough to mimic, on
a microscopic scale, conditions soon after the Big Bang. It also shows that
they can no longer count on the US, the world's chief paymaster for big
science projects for the past two generations, to fund ever more expensive
machines to delve deeper and deeper into the nature of matter.
Instead they have to rely on Europe's more cautious governments - and in
particular on Cern, the 19-nation particle physics laboratory outside
Geneva. This year Cern members must decide whether to pick up the baton and
build a new accelerator.
Cern's proposed Large Hadron Collider is relatively cheap, with an estimated
price not much above Pounds 1bn. That is partly because LHC would be smaller
than SSC but mainly because it does not need a new tunnel; it can share the
27 km loop housing Cern's current accelerator, LEP. Whereas LEP smashes
together light electrons and positrons LHC will collide protons - relatively
heavy particles - at virtually the speed of light.
Christopher Llewellyn Smith, the Oxford physicist who takes over as Cern
director-general today, estimates that LHC would cost Pounds 4bn to build
from scratch. Most observers believe that European science ministers will
agree to fund LHC at the bargain price, though construction may be delayed
by attempts to negotiate some US participation.
LHC collisions will release more energy - within an extremely confined space
 -than any previous events on earth. Some of this should manifest itself in
the form of subatomic particles last generated in the first moments of the
universe. Most eagerly anticipated is the 'Higgs boson', the particle
believed to give all matter its mass.
While particle physicists try to recreate conditions of the Big Bang on
earth, astronomers and cosmologists look for direct evidence of its
aftermath in the skies. Fortunately they have a much wider choice of
instruments and greater diversity of data. No single event, even the loss of
the Hubble space telescope, could have such a devastating effect on
astronomy as the SSC cancellation did on particle physics.
Take, for example, the momentous announcement in April 1992 that the US
Cosmic Background Explorer satellite had detected 'cosmic ripples' of
microwave radiation from the young universe - the first signs of the
unevenness which gravity later pulled into clusters of galaxies and stars.
Since then the observation has been confirmed and extended by several other
instruments, operating from the ground and from high-altitude balloons as
well as from space. If Cobe had failed, the ripples would still have been
discovered.
Besides consolidating the position of the Big Bang in cosmology the ripples
have helped to support some specific theories about the development and
structure of the universe. They fit well with the 'inflationary' model,
which postulates a super-expansionary burst immediately after the Big Bang;
random fluctuations during this period, lasting less than one billion
billion billionth of a second, sowed the seeds of unevenness.
The observations are also consistent with a universe precisely balanced
between being 'closed' and 'open'. If so, it would contain exactly the right
amount of matter for gravity to stop the universe expanding, after an
infinite period of time, but not enough to pull everything back together
again eventually in a Big Crunch.
Such a universe, with a 'critical density of one', appeals strongly to
cosmologists' yearning for mathematical neatness. One practical consequence
is that the universe must contain a vast amount of 'missing mass' - 10 to
100 times more than all the visible objects (galaxies, stars, dust clouds,
quasars and so on) observed so far.
Perhaps the greatest astronomical priority for 1994 will be to investigate
the nature of this 'dark matter'. Candidates include: ordinary matter in the
form of planet-sized Massive Compact Halo Objects; billions of small black
holes; slow-moving and virtually undetectable Weakly Interacting Massive
Particles; and neutrinos moving at virtually the speed of light. The smart
cosmological money is backing a combination of Machos and Wimps.
