  [Text] The Officers' Assembly was held at the Black Sea 
Fleet military base in Sevastopol. The officers have condemned 
the actions curried out by the Ukraine Navy against the 
personnel of the 318th Division of the reserve ships in Odessa. 
The assembly called on the Ukrainian Government and Defense 
Ministry to stop the arbitrary actions against the Black Sea 
Fleet, and said that the Black Sea Fleet is not to be 
intimidated and will remain, as before, faithful to the peoples 
of Russia and Ukraine, its military duty, and their oath of 
allegiance that is given only once. The incident in Odessa 
could be forgotten for the sake of accord between the two Slav 
states -- but only after an investigation and punishment of 
those responsible for it has been carried out. However, the 
Ukrainian side resists this. 
  [Begin Admiral Feliks Gromov recording, Black Sea Fleet 
commander] The Black Sea Fleet has requested permission from the 
Foreign and Defense Ministries of Ukraine to allow a medium 
assault landing force vessel carrying representatives of the 
Black Sea Fleet to arrive in Odessa and take onboard seamen who 
swore allegiance to Russia. So far, the Ukrainian Defense 
Ministry has not given its agreement to it. [end recording] 
  [Vozhzhov] Families of servicemen of the 318th Division in 
Odessa who refused to swear an oath of allegiance to Ukraine are 
now being evicted from their apartments. Besides, sources close 
to the Ukraine Navy General Staff report that an action similar 
to that in Odessa is being planned in Ismail, this time against 
a brigade of river vessels. 
  [Begin Gromov recording] The Black Sea Fleet problem should 
be solved once and for all in accordance with the Massandra 
Protocol. [end recording]
