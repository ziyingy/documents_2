  [Text] Tokyo, Dec. 31 KYODO -- Despite a wedding every 40 
seconds, fewer babies than ever were born in Japan in 1993 and a 
record number of couples ended up in divorces, the Health and 
Welfare Ministry said Friday [31 December]. 
  With 9.6 babies born per thousand people the birth rate hit 
a 
historic low. The number of births fell by 24,000 to 1.19 
million, sinking below the 1.2 million mark for the first time, 
the ministry said in announcing the estimate for this year. 
  The statistics were projected for the whole calendar year 
based on the number of births, deaths, marriages, and divorces 
registered between January 1 and October 31. 
  The low birth rate is expected to further reduce the 
fertility rate, which represents the average number of children 
a woman gives birth to in her life, from its all-time low last 
year of 1.5 children, officials said. To maintain the current 
population over the long run the rate must be 2.1 or above. 
  Apparently sparked by the June wedding between Crown Prince 
Naruhito and Masako Owada, 38,000 more couples tied the knot 
than in 1992. The number of marriages has been continuously on 
the rise over the last six years, reaching 792,000 in 1993. 
  The wedding fever was especially strong in June, which saw 
an 
increase by 10,000 marriages over last year. On June 9 alone, 
the day of the royal wedding, 13,000 couples started married 
life. However, the country also experienced a second divorce 
boom following a first peak in 1983. After a continued rise 
over the last three years, divorces peaked at 189,000, an 
all-time high. Some 10,000 more couples decided to separate than 
last year, amounting to a divorce every 2 minutes 47 seconds. 
  While births still outstripped deaths, the natural 
population 
increase further slowed to an all-time low 302,000 people, 
50,000 less than in 1992. Partly due to an influenza epidemic 
in January and February, deaths soared by 26,000 to a record 
883,000. 
  As to the causes of death, cancer ranked top with 237,000 
cases, followed by 183,000 deaths resulting from heart diseases, 
and some 120,000 people dying from cerebrovascular diseases. 
The pattern remained unchanged since 1985.
