Financial service regulators are issuing guidance notes to member firms in
an attempt to prevent investors from being misled about high-income
products, especially where the 'income' may partly consist of the return of
capital.
High-income products have become popular in the past year as falling
interest rates have led investors to seek ways to replace income they
previously received from building societies. Some will not repay capital in
full unless conditions - such as stock market growth - are met.
Fimbra, the regulator for financial intermediaries, issued a guidance note
yesterday pointing out that 'if a rate of 'income' is offered which is
significantly higher than can be obtained by way of dividend or deposit
income, it will normally be the case that the higher return is obtained at
some risk to capital or at the expense of capital growth'. The regulator
said it was concerned that these risks were not being described to investors
in a manner which was 'clear, fair, and not misleading'.
