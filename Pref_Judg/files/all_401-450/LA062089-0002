<P>
Chris tells the story like he is repeating a segment from a dream in which 
every detail remains brilliantly clear. 
</P>
<P>
He can recall seeing a movement of the pale blue curtains in his bedroom that 
day and the patterns of light and shadow created by sunlight streaming through 
a window. 
</P>
<P>
He remembers a trace of his wife's perfume in the air and the fact that their 
dog Oscar was barking in the distance. He remembers hearing a hammer pounding 
in the neighborhood. 
</P>
<P>
Accidents happen on just those kinds of days. Ordinary days. Days of no 
expectations. Tuesday mornings or Thursday afternoons. 
</P>
<P>
We talk about it, Chris and I, because this isn't a dream he's discussing. 
</P>
<P>
He is telling me about an actual incident so chilling that it needs no 
surrounding drama to be etched in his mind. 
</P>
<P>
It was the day Tessie found her daddy's gun. 
</P>
<P>
Tessie's real name is Theresa, and she is one of those 3-year-olds who, like a 
hummingbird in flight, is never at rest. 
</P>
<P>
You'll find her climbing up a tree or trying to get to an upper shelf in the 
closet or crawling into a barrel head first with her feet sticking out. 
</P>
<P>
Tessie's mother, Della, left her alone for five minutes one day in their Santa 
Monica home while preparing for a party. She returned to the kitchen to 
discover that Tessie had painted the front of the refrigerator with clam dip 
and a basting brush. 
</P>
<P>
You get the idea. Tessie, her mother says, is into everything. Including places 
where guns are hidden. 
</P>
<P>
"It was only a moment that I didn't have my eye on her," Chris says, trying to 
assuage his immense feeling of guilt. 
</P>
<P>
"I was taking a day off because I'd hurt my back. Della was out shopping, and 
Tessie was home with me. I was putting a videotape on so she could watch 
cartoons. How long can something like that take?" 
</P>
<P>
Long enough for Tessie to scoot out of sight. 
</P>
<P>
Chris went through the house calling her name, but you can call Tess forever 
and she'll ignore you. Some kids are like that. 
</P>
<P>
"Why didn't you answer me?" you can ask. 
</P>
<P>
"Because," they'll say. Just because. 
</P>
<P>
"I knew she couldn't be far," Chris says. "I checked behind the couch where she 
likes to hide and in the bathroom where we keep the cat. Then I went into the 
master bedroom." 
</P>
<P>
He found Tessie. She had his gun in her hands. It was loaded. 
</P>
<P>
Chris sees it in freeze frame, a moment isolated in time while a message is 
flashed to the brain. 
</P>
<P>
 "Tessie!" 
</P>
<P>
 She had the snub-nosed .38-caliber revolver pointed toward her, looking into 
the barrel. A tiny thumb was on the trigger. 
</P>
<P>
He would say later that the first thought that flashed through his head was How 
could this happen? 
</P>
<P>
Chris was careful about the gun. He kept it locked in a cabinet next to his 
bed. He had the only key dangling from a bracelet on his wrist. Somehow he had 
failed to lock the cabinet. 
</P>
<P>
"How could I do that?" he asks in an anguished tone. "I'm the kind of guy who 
double-checks the stove at night to make sure all the burners are out. How 
could that happen?" 
</P>
<P>
 "Tessie!" 
</P>
<P>
 It was a question never answered. He only knew at that terrifying moment that 
his daughter, an imp with short hair and a smile like a spring morning, danced 
on the brink of eternity. 
</P>
<P>
Fourteen other kids danced on that same brink in the L.A. area during the past 
year. Fourteen times guns in the house were accidentally turned on them. Four 
of them died; one is in a coma; the others are maimed for life. 
</P>
<P>
 "Tessie!" 
</P>
<P>
 The freeze frame ended. Chris exploded into action. In less than the time it 
takes for a leaf to fall, he had the gun away from her and Tessie in his arms. 
And he was crying. 
</P>
<P>
They were tears of relief. 
</P>
<P>
By what caprice does Tessie live and another child die? Who decides? What sets 
the standards? Chris could only guess. Tessie was OK. That's what mattered. 
</P>
<P>
There is no longer a gun in the house, and Chris wonders what he'd do if an 
intruder forced his way in. 
</P>
<P>
"I don't know," he says. "I only know I'll never own another weapon." 
</P>
<P>
We are in his back yard watching Tessie play in the sandbox. Suddenly, for no 
apparent reason, she makes a dash for a back fence and is halfway up before 
Chris can get her down. 
</P>
<P>
He is shaking his head as he carries her back to the sandbox. Tessie is 
laughing. There is sunlight in her hair. 
</P>
