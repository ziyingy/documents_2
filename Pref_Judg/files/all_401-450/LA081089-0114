Immediately eliminate pollution along the nation's shores or risk permanent 
danger to human and marine life, an environmental group urged the federal 
government. The Natural Resources Defense Council unveiled its program to 
address short-term health threats within five years, and maintain the long-term 
health of coastal waters within 10 years. "The trillions of gallons of waste 
dumped into coastal waters each year are dangerous to human as well as marine 
life," said Bob Adler, senior lawyer for the council. Emphasizing plumbing 
efficiency standards for buildings, the group urged "a tightening of guidelines 
for industries that practice sewage dumping. We need to immediately revise the 
limits set on the amount of pollution a factory or sewage treatment plant is 
allowed to discharge." Adler noted that at least 81 beaches -- all in the 
Mid-Atlantic and Northeast region -- have been closed so far this year because 
of health threats due to waste.
