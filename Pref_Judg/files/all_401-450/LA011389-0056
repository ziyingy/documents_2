A jury has recently held Gates liable for damages for the acts of his officers. 
Now, lawyers for relatives of two murdered jail inmates are talking of holding 
Orange County Sheriff Brad Gates personally liable. They cite the Indian 
government's action in charging Union Carbide officials in the United States 
with manslaughter in the Bhopal disaster.

These events, together with the growing number of policemen killed in line of 
duty, should dampen the enthusiasm of able individuals to serve the people of 
California in these complex and dangerous jobs. It is as important to protect 
the police from the bullets and attacks of the public as it is to protect the 
public from excess use of police force in risky or provocative situations or 
occasional clear instances of brutality. If police heads did not support their 
officers, there would soon be no police to face the Russian roulette of gangs, 
drugs, domestic violence and other crimes.

While enthusiasm for police work may diminish, enthusiasm for the practice of 
law should increase. Just when it seemed there were too many lawyers, a whole 
new field of lucrative lawsuits is opening up, as liability is extended from 
institutions to persons in ever-widening circles. How far do we go in holding 
individuals responsible for failures in their systems?

Shall we hold the heads of corporations legally liable for the acts of their 
employees? Generals for the misconduct of their soldiers? The President of the 
United States for the acts of his subordinates?

Holding people responsible for the behavior of others, barring conspiracy, is 
unjust and an ominous precedent. It could negatively affect all our 
institutions, which are already overburdened with problems.
