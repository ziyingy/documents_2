<P>
Having motor oil, paints, pesticides and other toxics around the house can 
really add up. 
</P>
<P>
Officials in Orange County estimate that each household generates about 7.5 
pounds of hazardous waste per year, for a total of about 3,000 tons per year in 
the county. 
</P>
<P>
But what to do with it all? 
</P>
<P>
Many places around the country in recent years, Orange County included, have 
held hazardous waste collection days for the environmentally conscious 
homeowner. 
</P>
<P>
That's all to the good. 
</P>
<P>
The public response has been heartening, too, a sign that many people 
understand the dangers posed by illegal dumping of hazardous waste. 
</P>
<P>
Still, even the best intentions can result in frayed nerves for the people 
stuck waiting in line to leave their items on rare collection days. 
</P>
<P>
Orange County now has a good answer -- it has opened its first permanent 
collection center for hazardous waste in Anaheim, giving residents the best 
legal alternative for disposal of toxic materials. 
</P>
<P>
Free of charge, residents can drop off household materials at 2761 E. White 
Star Ave. from 9 a.m. to 3 p.m. Tuesdays through Saturdays. 
</P>
<P>
The site is one of six expected to open in the county. 
</P>
<P>
Others are to open by the end of the summer in San Juan Capistrano, Huntington 
Beach, Brea and Stanton, and the county is looking for a location in Irvine. 
</P>
<P>
The Anaheim center is located on property already used as a commercial garbage 
transfer station, and serves as a collection point. From there, the waste will 
be hauled to special toxic-waste landfills, disposal sites, or recycling 
centers. 
</P>
<P>
The Board of Supervisors, which approved the funding for household waste 
centers last year, is to be congratulated for having the vision to go ahead 
with this project. 
</P>
<P>
The center signals the county's willingness to help keep hazardous materials 
out of sewers or storm drains, where they end up damaging the environment.
