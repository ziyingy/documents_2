  [Text] The drugs police in Helsinki have uncovered the 
biggest criminal drug ring in Finland so far. A gang, which has 
been operating systematically, has smuggled hashish, 
amphetamines, and heroin to Finland, apparently for a couple of 
years. According to the drugs police, the substances were 
brought to Finland mainly from the Netherlands. So far the 
police have confiscated 35 kg of hashish and small amounts of 
amphetamines and heroin. The total quantity of drugs is not yet 
known, but it appears that hundreds of kilos of hashish have 
been imported. A large number of various property crimes and an 
extensive economic crime ring are linked to the now uncovered 
case. Police have arrested 25 people in connection with the 
case. According to the police, most of those involved in the 
smuggling come from the capital region.
