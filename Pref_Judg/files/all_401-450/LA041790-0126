Scientists for the first time have found a gene that appears to be linked to 
alcoholism, providing strong new evidence the disease affecting 18 million 
Americans is caused at least partly by heredity, it was reported today. 
</P>
<P>
A study of tissue from the brains of 70 human cadavers concluded the gene was 
present in 77% of alcoholics and absent in 72% of non-alcoholics, researchers 
reported in the Journal of the American Medical Assn. 
</P>
<P>
This is the first reported link between a particular gene and the presence of 
alcoholism in individuals, although there has been a growing body of evidence 
suggesting a role for heredity. 
</P>
<P>
The findings could lead to better ways to identify people at risk of becoming 
alcoholics and a greater understanding of the underlying causes of the disease, 
which could lead to new treatments and preventive measures.
