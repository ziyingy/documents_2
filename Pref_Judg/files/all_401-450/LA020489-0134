There are no heroes in "Gameface," a play written by John Schalter and former 
Ram offensive lineman Russ Bollinger, currently at the Flight Theater in 
Hollywood. However, there are moments in this portrayal of professional 
football life when you believe what Bollinger and Schalter have presented is 
true -- or could be. See Gene Wojciechowski's column. Sports section, Page 1.
