ONE OF the most important programmes of scientific research everdevised is
under way, in a massive cooperative effort in laboratories around the world.
It is the Human Genome Project, and it concerns nothing less than the nature
of man. In his entertainingly clear account, Robert Shapiro explains what it
is and explores the exciting and sometimes alarming possibilities it offers.
Genome research is the province of that department of biological science
called genetics. Genetics is the investigation of how organisms bequeath
anatomical, physiological and behavioural traits to their offspring, and how
such traits express themselves in the formation and development of
individual organisms. Central to this inquiry is the concept of the gene, a
chemical packet of information which is the fundamental unit of heredity.
The word 'gene' was coined in 1909, but the idea dates back to the work of
the 19th century monk Gregor Mendel, who studied heredity in sweet peas and
proposed a mechanism by which characteristics are passed between
generations. Little more than a century has elapsed since Mendel's day, but
genetics has proved to be one of the most important sciences in history.
The sum of all genetic material in a given organism is called the 'genome'.
It is a hugely complex chemical storehouse of information, a code or script
in which is written the secrets of every physical aspect of a living
creature. The quantity of information in a single human genome is equivalent
to the amount of data in a thousand telephone directories each a thousand
pages long.
When scientists can read the code, they will have information about an
individual's genetic make-up which will reveal not only his heredity (for
example, which forebears bequeathed him his height, colouring and other
traits), but something of his fate also - for example, the diseases he has
or might be prone to, and the possibility of his offspring inheriting these
or those characteristics and conditions.
Genetics has already explained much and made many things possible,
especially in medicine, where it has proved itself a powerful tool.
Transplant surgery, prenatal diagnosis, cancer treatments, the manufacture
of insulin for treatment of diabetics: all would be impossible without
genetics. Genetics is crucial in cystic fibrosis research and the attempt to
understand Alzheimer's disease. But these advances are based on limited and
partial knowledge of the human genome, which until recently presented too
large a task for more than piecemeal investigation.
Thanks to brilliant recent discoveries about how to read the genetic code,
together with the bold imagination and resolve of scientists prepared to
work together on a long-term international project, the limits on scientific
understanding of the genome are being pushed back. At a meeting in San
Diego, California, in October 1989, the Human Genome Project was launched,
scheduled to take 15 years and promised Dollars 3bn by the US government
over that period.
With the right techniques established, and high-powered computer technology
available, there is excitement among the researchers. What has been
described as the 'holy grail' of human genetics is close at hand.
James Watson, one of the discoverers of DNA and the Genome Project's head,
has said: 'A more important set of instruction books will never be found by
human beings. When finally interpreted, the genetic messages encoded within
our DNA will provide the ultimate answers to the chemical underpinnings of
human existence.'
Shapiro takes us through the detective story of how genetics developed, and
lucidly explains the nature of the genome and the task of investigating it.
In the collection of essays edited by Kevles and Hood the same terrain is
covered, but more technically. Both books make admirable and successful
efforts to equip general readers with a clear grasp of the issues - an
important matter, because the future of genome research prompts a number of
difficult questions.
This is illustrated by both books when they turn from explanation of the
genome project to the consequences of its successful completion. Armed with
so much genetic knowledge, will we be tempted to manipulate the genetic
material of future people not just to exclude hereditary diseases, but to
make them taller, more intelligent, more athletic? Should employers know the
genetic profile of potential employees, some of whom they might refuse to
employ because they have, say, a genetic risk of early death from heart
disease? What policies should we adopt now to cope with the taxing choices
we shall soon have to make, now that all this knowledge is rushing upon us?
Shapiro, and the contributors to the Kevles and Hood volume, issue us with
an invitation to reflect on these questions while there is still time.
