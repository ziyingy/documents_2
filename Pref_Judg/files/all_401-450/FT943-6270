Arbitrage and dealer buying outweighed selling by institutional investors,
writes Emiko Terazono in Tokyo, and the Nikkei 225 average gained 128.93 at
20,600.42 after a day's low of 20,518.80 and high of 20,722.84.
A rise in the futures market prompted by the easing of the yen and Friday's
rally on Wall Street triggered arbitrage buying in the morning. In the
afternoon, the index faced profit-taking by institutional investors booking
profits ahead of the September book closing.
The Topix index of all first section stocks was finally 4.39 ahead at
1,640.08 and the Nikkei 300 up 0.76 at 298.37. Advances led declines by 592
to 327, with 222 issues unchanged.
Traders said that while buying orders from public funds were putting a floor
under the market, the Nikkei 225 lacked the support to rise above 21,000.
'There seem to be a lot of selling orders from corporations around the
20,700 level,' said Mr Yasuo Ueki at Nikko Securities. Overseas investors
remained on the buying side, and supported the steel sector.

Y2.11m per share yesterday. The government will announce the public offering
price of the remaining 436,666 shares to be offered publicly tomorrow.

Y1.01m, and Nippon Telegraph and Telephone added Y5,000 at Y885,000. Nippon

regional markets. Hong Kong was closed for a public holiday.
