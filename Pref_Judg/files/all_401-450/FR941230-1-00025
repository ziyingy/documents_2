Certain partnerships disregarded. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->

are treated as the actions of the partners for purposes of the private business tests and private loan financing test
if_
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(i) The partnership could validly elect under section 761(a)(2) to be excluded from the application of Subchapter
K of the Code and all allocations to partners are consistent with each partner being allocated the same distributive

period that the person is a partner; or
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(ii) Each of the partners is a governmental person and all of the partnership's income is excludable from gross income
under section 115.
