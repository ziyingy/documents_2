EPA notes further that there have been only a handful (fewer than 10) of applications for treatability variances since
implementation of the land ban (aside from applications relating to contaminated media and debris), of which EPA
has granted three. In the applications relating to electroplating wastes cited earlier, the Agency inferred that
something about the applicants' wastes was making the wastes more difficult to treat than the waste EPA evaluated
when promulgating the applicable treatment standard. This inference was based on the fact that the applicants were
treating the waste with properly designed and operated BDAT treatment technology, namely the same type of treatment
technology on which the treatment standard is based. 56 FR at 12352. EPA emphasizes that this type of inference was,
and remains, permissible.

A. Corrections to the Interim Final Rule Establishing Land Disposal Restrictions for Certain Ignitable and Corrosive
Wastes
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
On May 24, 1993, the EPA published an interim final rule establishing treatment standards for ignitable and corrosive
characteristic wastes except those disposed in facilities regulated under the Clean Water Act (CWA), or Class I injection
wells subject to the Safe Drinking Water Act, or zero-discharge facilities engaged in CWA-equivalent treatment.
In today's rule, the Agency is clarifying that the provisions of the interim final rule remain in effect unless and
until they are superseded in future LDR rules. The Agency does not plan to issue a final rule at this time; however, it
is using the comments received on the interim final rule in developing future rules concerning the portions of the
Third Third Land Disposal Restrictions Rule which were remanded by the D.C. Circuit (for discussion of the court ruling,
see 58 FR 29861).
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Among other things, the interim final rule established treatment standards for the underlying hazardous constituents
reasonably expected to be present in the affected wastes at the point of generation. These treatment standards were
the concentration levels for the constituents found in F039 (multisource leachate) wastewaters and nonwastewaters.
The Agency is clarifying here that the universal treatment standards (UTS) established today supersede the F039
standards. Therefore, underlying hazardous constituents in the ignitable and corrosive wastes covered by the interim
final rule must meet the 40 CFR 268.48, Table UTS_Universal Treatment Standards, levels before they can be land disposed.
This change is being made simply so that the references to treatment standards for underlying hazardous constituents
in ignitable and corrosive wastes in the interim final rule will be the same as those established for organic TC wastes
in today's rule.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Also in the interim final rule, the Agency promulgated requirements to address a concern raised by the court about
the potential for volatile organic constituent (VOC) emissions to create violent reactions during the dilution
of ignitable and reactive wastes (see 58 FR 29873). The regulatory language in &sect;&sect;264.1(g)(6) and 265.1(c)(10),
however, inadvertently promulgated requirements for ignitable (D001) wastes and corrosive (D002) wastes. These
sections are being corrected in today's rule to indicate, rightly, that the requirements apply to ignitable (D001)
and reactive (D003) wastes.

B. Corrections to the Phase I Rule Establishing Land Disposal Restrictions for Newly Listed Wastes and Hazardous
Debris
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Today's rule clarifies several issues from the final rule establishing Land Disposal Restrictions for Newly Listed
Wastes and Hazardous Debris (57 FR 37194, August 18, 1992).
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The first issue being corrected responds to questions over which treatment standards can be used for treating hazardous
debris. It was stated clearly in the preamble to the August 18, 1992 rule that debris must be treated by either using
one of the specified technologies in &sect;268.45, or, as an alternative, by meeting LDRs for the specific prohibited
listed or characteristic waste with which the debris is contaminated (57 FR 37221). Subsequent comment from the regulated
community indicate that this fact was not made completely clear in the regulatory language of that rule. Certain commenters
suggested that a revision of the paperwork requirements found in &sect;268.7 indicating that generators have a choice
as to which treatment standards they may use would help alleviate the confusion.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
EPA is, therefore, revising &sect;268.7(a)(1)(iv) and &sect;268.7(a)(3)(v) to reflect that it is not mandatory
to meet the alternative debris standards in &sect;268.45, and that generators have the option to meet the treatment
standards for the as-generated wastes contaminating the debris. It should be noted that the paperwork requirements
for meeting treatment standards for as-generated wastes contaminating debris are the same as those for as-generated
wastes. A new paragraph is being added to the regulatory language to indicate this.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In addition, consistent with EPA's effort to simplify LDR paperwork requirements, EPA is shortening the notification
statement accompanying prohibited debris. In &sect;268.7(a)(1)(iv) and &sect;268.7(a)(3)(v), as promulgated
on August 18, 1992, the statement ``This hazardous debris is subject to the alternative treatment standards of 40
CFR 268.45'' was required to be placed on the LDR notification, after listing the contaminants subject to treatment.
EPA is revising that particular statement today so that merely referencing &sect;268.45 after listing the contaminants
subject to treatment is all that must be included on the LDR notification.
