  [Text] Prime Minister Chuan Likphai spoke with newsmen on 
23 January while on an inspection trip to Phetchabun Province 
about the proposal of Khun Sa, a world-renowned narcotics king 
and Shan State leader, for Thailand to help the Shan State 
become a narcotics-free zone. He said the Khun Sa question is 
Burma's business, not Thailand's. He added that Thailand cannot 
become involved in the issue. 
  In an earlier interview, Khun Sa said he wanted to create a 
heroin-free zone in Shan State. He urged Thai Prime Minister 
Chuan Likphai to coordinate with U.S. President Bill Clinton in 
pushing for a realization of the zone in order to avoid having 
to set aside funds for narcotics suppression. The purpose of 
Khun Sa's move is to gain the international community's 
recognition of the Shan State as an independent territory. Khun 
Sa asserted that the Shan State Government under his leadership 
has not supported opium cultivation; however, it has not been 
able to prevent its people from engaging in such cultivation.
