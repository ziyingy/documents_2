The Los Angeles Regional Planning Commission on Wednesday delayed a vote on the 
proposed Sunshine Canyon landfill expansion for two months after instructing 
the county staff to develop stricter conditions for its operation. 
</P>
<P>
The commission asked the staff to prepare alternate regulations for the 
landfill near Granada Hills after Commissioner Lee Strong complained that "the 
conditions don't go far enough." 
</P>
<P>
The biggest change that Strong proposed was to only grant the landfill owner, 
Browning-Ferris Industries, permission to dump 17 million tons of trash there 
before the company would have to once again seek county approval to continue 
operating. The county staff had recommended that the company be allowed to dump 
70 million tons there. 
</P>
<P>
Strong said the company might be a better neighbor if it knew its investment 
could be jeopardized by violating operating rules. 
</P>
<P>
The waste disposal firm wants to expand its 230-acre dump into an additional 
542 acres of unincorporated county land. The firm contends that the landfill 
must be enlarged to cope with the region's garbage crisis, but neighbors 
complain that an expansion would destroy thousands of trees and extend the life 
of what is already an environmental nuisance. 
</P>
<P>
Both Browning-Ferris and the landfill's opponents appeared to leave the meeting 
Wednesday half-satisfied. 
</P>
<P>
Chris Funk, an attorney for Browning-Ferris, said he was pleased because the 
commission appeared to favor the expansion. 
</P>
<P>
"I thought the tenor of the discussion is how to get this done," Funk said. 
</P>
<P>
But Funk warned that the company might have to reconsider its proposal to 
donate 524 acres adjacent to the expansion site for parkland if the life of its 
operating permit is shortened. 
</P>
<P>
Opponents said they were happy that the final decision was postponed. But they 
agreed with Funk's assessment that it appeared the commission was on the verge 
of approving the expansion. 
</P>
<P>
"It's sort of like an execution," said Mary Edwards, secretary of the North 
Valley Coalition, a homeowner group that has fought the landfill's expansion. 
"You are glad it's postponed, but you'd be happy if it wouldn't happen at all." 
</P>
<P>
During the meeting, Edwards and about two dozen other activists wore white gags 
in their mouths to protest the county's refusal to allow them to comment on 
Browning-Ferris' revised environmental impact report. Since February when the 
planning commission closed public debate on the project, Browning-Ferris has 
added two thick volumes to the report. 
</P>
<P>
At Wednesday's meeting, Strong also proposed limiting the volume of trash 
dumped daily in the proposed expansion area to 6,000 tons rather than 8,000 
tons. He also said he wanted the company to pay the county 10% rather than 5% 
of the per-ton fee it will charge its customers. And he suggested that 
Browning-Ferris post a large bond to ensure that litter and rodent problems are 
controlled. 
</P>
<P>
"The record hasn't been too great on that," said Strong, commenting on 
Browning-Ferris' performance at the landfill. 
</P>
<P>
Commissioners said they would compare the original set of conditions and the 
revisions on Sept. 27 and then decide whether to choose one set or to combine 
them. The Los Angeles County Board of Supervisors will ultimately decide 
whether the landfill should be enlarged.
