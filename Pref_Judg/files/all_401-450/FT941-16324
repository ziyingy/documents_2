Clare Spottiswoode, the new gas industry regulator, continues to beef up her
staff ahead of the deregulation of the gas industry prompted by the recent
monopoly inquiry.
She has appointed Eileen Marshall to the newly created post of chief
economic adviser where she will lead the in-house team of economists.
Marshall, who joins Ofgas on April 1, is currently director of regulation
and business affairs at Offer, the electricity regulator. She will be
replaced by Tony Boorman, the director of consumer affairs.
