The two hijackers who forced a China Southern Airlines Boeing 757 carrying
204 people to Taiwan yesterday are taken away by police at Taipei's main
airport. The men, armed with pistols, had stormed the cockpit of a Beijing
flight bound for the southern Chinese city of Shenzhen. The aircraft
returned to China, but the hijackers, who asked for political asylum,
remained in custody.
