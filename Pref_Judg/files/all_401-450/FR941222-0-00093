(f) After January 23, 1995, an operator of an 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
NPS-approved existing landfill solid waste disposal site may 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
convert that site to a transfer station only after submitting a 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
request under paragraph (a) of this section, and only after 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
receiving approval from the Regional Director under paragraph (c) 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
of this section. The Regional Director may approve such a request, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
if in addition to meeting the standards of paragraph (c) of this 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
section, the Regional Director finds that the conversion to a 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
transfer station better protects the unit's natural or cultural 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
resources than the existing land-fill operation.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
(a) An operator of a solid waste disposal site located on 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
lands or waters added to the National Park System, by act of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Congress or by proclamation, after January 23, 1995, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
will not be permitted to dispose of solid waste after expiration 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
of the permit or license in effect on the date of the land's or 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
water's designation as being within a National Park System unit's 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
boundaries. The operator must then immediately fulfill all 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
applicable closure and post-closure care requirements. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(b) An operator of a solid waste disposal site located on 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
lands or waters designated as being within the boundaries of a unit 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
of the National Park System established or expanded after January 23, 1995, who wishes to remain in operation for 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the duration of the existing permit or license, must submit to 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the Regional Director, within 180 calendar days of the land's or 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
water's designation as being within a National Park System unit 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
boundaries, a permit request and environmental report as 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
described in &sect;6.4(b) (1)&hyph;(9). 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(c) Any operator who fails to submit a request as described in 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
paragraph (b) of this section will be subject to the penalty 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
provisions of &sect;6.12. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(d) If the Regional Director finds that the permit request and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the environmental report do not meet the conditions for approval 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
set forth in &sect;6.5(c), the Regional Director will reject the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
request and notify the proposed operator of the reasons for the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
rejection. Within 90 calendar days of such notice, the operator of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the solid waste disposal site must cease disposing of solid waste 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
at the site. The operator may resume disposing of solid waste only 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
upon submission and approval of a permit request and environmental 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
report that the Regional Director determines meet the conditions 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
set forth in &sect;6.5(c).

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
(a) Solid waste from mining includes but is not limited to 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
mining overburden, mining byproducts, solid waste from the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
extraction, processing and beneficiation of ores and minerals, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
drilling fluids, produced waters, and other wastes associated 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
with exploration, development, or production of oil, natural gas 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
or geothermal energy and any garbage, refuse or sludge associated 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
with mining and mineral operations. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(b) A person conducting mining or mineral operations on January 23, 1995, and not governed by a plan of operations approved
under 36 CFR part 9, Minerals Management, or pursuant to the terms of a Federal mineral lease, may continue to operate
a solid waste disposal site within the boundaries of a 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
unit only after complying with &sect;6.5 and &sect;6.10 and with a permit issued by the Regional Director under &sect;6.9.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(c) A person conducting mining or mineral operations on January 23, 1995, and governed by a plan of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
operations approved under 36 CFR part 9 or pursuant to the terms 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
of a Federal mineral lease may continue to operate a solid waste 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
disposal site under the terms of the approved plan of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
operations or lease. Where an existing mining or mineral 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
operation is governed by 36 CFR part 9 or a Federal mineral 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
lease, an NPS-approved plan of operations will constitute the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
permit for solid waste disposal site operation otherwise required 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
under &sect;6.9. A bond required under 36 CFR part 9, or by the Bureau 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
of Land Management for Federal lessees, will satisfy the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
requirements of &sect;6.10. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(d) A person proposing to initiate mining or mineral operations 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
after January 23, 1995, within the boundaries of a 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
unit of the National Park System, whether or not governed by a plan 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
of operations approved under 36 CFR part 9 or the terms of a 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Federal mineral lease, may not establish or operate a new solid 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
waste disposal site within a unit.
