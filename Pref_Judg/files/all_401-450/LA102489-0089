State Farm to Have Underwriting Loss: State Farm Insurance Group, the largest 
home insurer in California, said it will suffer an underwriting loss of about 
$1 billion after the twin disasters of the San Francisco earthquake and 
Hurricane Hugo. State Farm expects to pay out about $300 million to cover 
insured damage suffered in last Tuesday's earthquake, said Ed Rust, president 
and chief executive of State Farm Mutual Automobile Insurance Co. But the total 
could go higher as damage appraisals continue over the coming weeks, he said.
