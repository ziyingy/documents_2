Caledonian Gas, the gas subsidiary of ScottishPower, is attempting to become
gas supplier to many of the 60,000 households all over the UK which are
entitled to choose a supplier other than British Gas.
It is launching a mailing campaign to target British Gas customers who take
2,500 therms or more of gas a year, equivalent to an annual bill from
British Gas of Pounds 1,120.
A customer paying Pounds 1,120 a year to British Gas is promised savings of
about Pounds 100, while a property with a gas bill of Pounds 2,000 would
save Pounds 173.
The Glasgow-based company believes it is the first independent gas supplier
to target large domestic users in addition to the commercial and industrial
customers who are the independent gas suppliers' main market. It already has
a handful of domestic customers in Scotland.
It believes that the campaign, covering the whole of Britain, should give it
a head start for when the domestic market with its 18m customers is opened
to competition from April 1996.
British Gas is obliged to deliver gas on behalf of other suppliers.
Caledonian Gas pays British Gas to transmit its gas, read its customers'
meters and provide safety cover.
The mailshot will emphasise that transferring to an independent gas company
does not involve disconnection or installing new pipes. New customers of
Caledonian Gas would notify British Gas that they wish it to terminate
supplies.
Caledonian Gas is targeting homes which have installed gas central heating,
have at least five bedrooms and were built before 1979, making them unlikely
to have heat insulation.
Caledonian Gas hopes potential customers who receive the mailshot will pass
on the word to their neighbours. Those whose gas consumption is below the
2,500-therm threshold can pre-register for the opening of the market.
