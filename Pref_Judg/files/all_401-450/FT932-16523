MINISTERS from nine EC member states yesterday underlined their commitment
to lifting passport checks on travellers within the European Community.
Ministers from the nine members of the Schengen free-travel zone stressed
that free movement of citizens was vital to the success of the single
European market, during the opening televised debate of yesterday's meeting
of internal market ministers in Luxembourg.
Only ministers from the three EC countries which are not members of the
Schengen agreement - Britain, Ireland and Denmark - omitted to mention the
outstanding problems over free movement of people in their opening speeches.
Internal border controls on people were supposed to disappear on January 1,
but technical and political problems have prevented even the Schengen nine
from meeting their commitment to the single market.
They have now promised to lift all outstanding controls at land and sea
borders by July and controls at airports by the end of December.
The remaining trio, led by Britain, are likely to retain controls beyond the
end of the year.
This is despite veiled threats from the Commission of legal or legislative
action against intransigent member states.
However, even Schengen countries have political problems with the abolition
of controls, and the free-travel agreement has not yet been ratified in all
the member states.
Mr Alain Lamassoure, France's new minister for European affairs, said
external borders would have to be strengthened and national rules on drugs
harmonised before internal checks could be abolished.
Mr Lamassoure also complained that currency instability had undermined the
single market.
He said last year's devaluations in the Community had cost France's overall
balance of payments about FFr1bn (Pounds 120m).
Internal market ministers again failed to reach agreement on a voluntary
Community-wide company statute for multinationals, after Britain blocked the
measure. The British government believes the measure is not necessary.
The UK dislikes provisions which would oblige companies to consult workers
on important strategic decisions.
