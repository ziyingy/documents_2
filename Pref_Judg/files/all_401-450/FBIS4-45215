  [Text] Up to 50,000 Burmese have fled to Thailand to 
escape the current offensive by the Burmese Army against the 
forces of drug warlord Khun Sa, according to Khachatphai 
Burutphat, deputy secretary-general of the National Security 
Council. 
  Khachatphai said, however, the fighting is not as fierce as 
that by the Burmese government against Karen forces. 
  "I expect Khun Sa's people escaped to Chiang Mai and Mae 
Hong 
Son Provinces. However, the authorities are prepared to deal 
with the problems that may arise", he said. 
  Khachatphai also said that Thailand would take care of and 
assist the refugees on humanitarian grounds. But they would be 
sent back to Burma as soon as the situation has improved. 
  He added that the authorities are able to ensure security 
for 
people living in the troubled border area. 
  Asked to comment on whether the U.S. government is to 
provide 
assistance for the Burmese government to battle Khun Sa's 
troops, Khachatphai said the Council had not yet learned if the 
United States would support the Burmese forces. 
  Also, Khachatphai said the fighting is aimed at cracking 
down 
on the production and trafficking of drugs by Khun Sa.
