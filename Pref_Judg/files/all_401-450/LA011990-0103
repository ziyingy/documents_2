An international treaty to protect the dwindling herds of African elephants by 
banning trade in ivory went into force Thursday, but leading producing and 
consuming nations refused to be bound by it. 
</P>
<P>
Five African nations that regularly cull their elephant populations have filed 
for exemption, while China has said that it will continue importing tusks. 
</P>
<P>
Britain has asked for a six-month trading extension for Hong Kong to allow the 
colony to sell off its ivory stockpile of 670 tons. 
</P>
<P>
The trade ban was agreed upon after bitter debate at an October meeting of the 
103-nation Convention on Trade in Endangered Species. Countries had until 
Thursday to file for an exemption to enable them to continue trade with those 
members who also filed reservations or with the 60 countries outside the 
convention. 
</P>
<P>
South Africa, Zimbabwe, Zambia, Botswana and Malawi submitted reservations by 
the deadline, said Jean-Patrick Le Duc, spokesman for the Swiss-based 
convention secretariat. 
</P>
<P>
South Africa and Zimbabwe, which both have large, well-managed elephant 
populations, have argued that they need revenue from ivory sales to continue 
protecting the animals successfully.
