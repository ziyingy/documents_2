  [Text] Frankfurt/Main -- In the view of the Pro Asyl 
refugee relief organization, cooperation between German and 
Turkish intelligence services is constituting a danger for 
politically active Kurds. The information system as provided 
for by the Schengen Treaty (SIS) that nine European Union [EU] 
countries intend to implement in the fall creates an additional 
potential data base for police, military forces, and the 
intelligence services, also in Turkey, Pro Asyl and the German 
Association for Data Protection said critically in Frankfurt. 
  German intelligence circles have confirmed for DPA the 
exchange of data with NATO partner Turkey. The German side was, 
however, pursuing a restrictive policy, and any information that 
is provided is consistent with the FRG principles of a 
law-governed state. This means that information is denied if 
affected persons would have to fear "dangers of a special kind." 
The exchange of information is exclusively restricted to 
"counterespionage and the fight against terrorism."
