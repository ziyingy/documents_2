Can some Justice Department operations be turned over to private industry? 
</P>
<P>
In the eyes of many department employees, the idea is unworkable -- the 
brainchild of short-sighted budget cutters and free-market zealots left over 
from the Ronald Reagan Administration. 
</P>
<P>
But to the Office of Management and Budget, and apparently some Justice 
managers, the move may be long overdue. This month, responding to a 
longstanding OMB directive, the department announced that it may look for 
private contractors to oversee hundreds of millions of dollars in anti-drug, 
child abuse and other programs managed by two agencies in the Office of Justice 
Programs -- the Office of Juvenile Justice and Delinquency Prevention and the 
Bureau of Justice Assistance. 
</P>
<P>
The bid to "contract out" these programs would eliminate the jobs of 48 program 
managers and other social scientists -- or more than 60% of the career 
positions in the two agencies. These managers oversee and evaluate federal 
grants that sponsor community anti-drug workshops, train police to cope with 
child abuse cases, run "neighborhood watch" anti-crime programs and scores of 
other locally oriented criminal justice efforts. 
</P>
<P>
"This is all a farce," charged Stu Smith, president of the American Federation 
of State, County and Municipal Employees Local 2830, which represents the 
employees in the Office of Justice Programs. "These people are not giving 
haircuts . . . or making widgets. These are all inherently government 
functions." 
</P>
<P>
Velva Walter, spokeswoman for the Office of Justice Programs, said that is 
precisely what the department wants to find out. Under current OMB policy, 
departments must constantly review the work force to determine what positions 
can be more efficiently performed by the private sector. "It was determined 
that the social scientist positions constituted the single largest function 
capable of being contracted out," Walter said. 
</P>
<P>
Walter also said that no final decisions have been made. "We are just doing 
what is required by OMB . . . to perform a study," she said. 
</P>
<P>
But Smith argued that the department clearly tipped its hand by running a 
notice in Commerce Business Daily soliciting a private contractor to determine 
"the availability of commercial sources" for providing services to the Office 
of Justice Programs.

The flap over the social scientists is the latest in a long-running debate over 
the wisdom of "privatizing" government services. Free-market conservatives have 
always favored the idea, arguing that private companies interested in 
maximizing profits are generally more efficient and productive than bureaucrats 
insulated from the rigors of the marketplace. 
</P>
<P>
Indeed, OMB officials contend they have saved millions of dollars in recent 
years by contracting out such services as the manicuring of lawns at the Coast 
Guard or custodial services at the Army Corps of Engineers. But some academic 
experts are skeptical. They argue that competition is the only sure guarantee 
of cost-saving, and that substituting a private monopoly for a government 
agency may produce just as much waste and abuse, as the Pentagon procurement 
scandals of a few years ago demonstrated. 
</P>
<P>
"It's not obvious that if you give a person a private monopoly that they can be 
more efficient than the government," said Clifford Winston, senior fellow at 
the Brookings Institution and a specialist in government regulation. 
</P>
<P>
The debate has been further complicated at the Justice Department, which until 
now has argued that, given the nature of its duties, the department ought to be 
immune from privatization altogether. Last year, for example, OMB moved in on 
the Federal Bureau of Investigation, identifying 640 positions that should be 
studied for privatization, including finger-printers, data transcribers and 
computer programmers. Justice officials -- backed by key allies on Capitol Hill 
-- fought back hard. Turning over sensitive bureau jobs to outside contractors 
could compromise foreign counterintelligence investigations and threaten the 
security of FBI crime computers, they argued. 
</P>
<P>
Late last year, OMB backed down on the FBI. But the war is far from over. OMB 
recently pushed Justice to study 1,981 positions for contracting out over the 
next four years. Ironically, even though OMB generally favors as many 
privatization studies as possible, the Office of Justice Programs social 
scientists were not even on the list. 
</P>
<P>
"This sounds like something that Justice is doing on their own," said an OMB 
spokeswoman.
