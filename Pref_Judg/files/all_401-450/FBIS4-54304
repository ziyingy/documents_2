  [Text] Foreign Minister Prasong Sunsiri yesterday 
reaffirmed an invitation for Burma to attend the ministerial 
meeting of the Association of Southeast Asian Nations, 
regardless of a warning letter from the Karen National Union 
[KNU] president. 
  "I have invited Burma and they have accepted the invitation. 
It's to bring them to the outside world," Sqn Ldr [Squadron 
Leader] Prasong said. 
  KNU president General Saw Bo Mya has asked ASEAN members not 
to invite Burma's military government to attend the Bangkok 
meeting in July. 
  Gen Bo Mya said the Karens would have problems if Burma was 
accepted as a member of ASEAN and the invitation was part of a 
bigger problem. 
  Sqn Ldr Prasong insisted he would not have contacts with the 
Karen leader because the Thai Government would only deal at 
government level. 
  "Gen Bo Mya is the opposite side to the Burmese government. 
We must have contact only with the Government," he said. 
  Gen Bo Mya said he had tried to contact Thai officials but 
they would not meet him. They gave no reason.
