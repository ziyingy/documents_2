THE Philippines' foreign secretary, Mr Roberto Romulo, has made a plea for
more investment in his country by the countries of the Association of
South-East Asian Nations (Asean). Speaking on a visit to Malaysia, he
described the present level of intra-Asean trade as lamentable.
At present only 2 per cent of total Philippines trade is with Malaysia,
while under one per cent of Malaysia's total trade is with the Philippines.
Mr Romulo said that Asean - which groups the Philippines, Malaysia,
Indonesia, Brunei, Thailand and Singapore - would never be credible to
others if it did not make serious moves towards better trade relations.
Trade relations in the region has been much discussed since the announcement
of the formation of the North American Free Trade Agreement (Nafta). Several
countries in the region say that Nafta could become a trade bloc and
seriously affect export performance.
Malaysia is advocating the formation of an East Asian Economic Caucus (EAEC)
to combat what it sees as the division of the world into competitive trading
groups.
