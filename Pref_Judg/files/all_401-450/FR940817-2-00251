The major advantages of FOB tests are that they can be administered within the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
context of other ongoing toxicological tests and provide some indication of the possible 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
neurological alterations produced by exposure. Potential problems include insufficient 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
interobserver reliability, difficulty in defining certain endpoints, and the tendency toward 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
observer bias. The latter can be controlled by using observers unaware of the actual 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
treatment of the subjects. Some FOB tests may not be very sensitive to agent-induced 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
sensory loss (i.e., vision, audition) or alterations in cognitive or integrative processes such as 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
learning and memory. FOB data may be used to trigger experiments performed at the next 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
tier of testing. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
FOB data may be interval, ordinal, or continuous (Creason, 1989). The relevance of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
statistically significant test results from an FOB is judged according to the number of signs 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
affected, the dose(s) at which neurotoxic signs are observed, and the nature, severity, and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
persistence of the effects. Data from the FOB may provide presumptive evidence of adverse 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
effects and neurotoxicity. If only a few unrelated measures in the FOB are affected or the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
effects are unrelated to dose, there is less concern about neurotoxic potentials of a chemical. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
If dose is associated with other overt signs of toxicity, including systemic toxicity, large 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
decreases in body weight, or debilitation, the data must be interpreted carefully. In cases 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
where several related measures in a battery of tests are affected and the effects appear to be 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
dose dependent, the level of concern about the potential of a chemical is higher.

4.3.2.2. Motor activity. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 -->
Movement within a defined environment is a naturally occurring 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
response and can be affected by environmental agents. Motor activity represents a broad 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
class of behaviors involving coordinated participation of sensory, motor, and integrative 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
processes. Motor activity measurements are noninvasive and can be used to evaluate the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
effects of acute and repeated exposure to chemicals (MacPhail et al., 1989). Motor activity 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
measurements have also been used in humans to evaluate disease states, including disorders 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
of the nervous system (Goldstein and Stein, 1985). The assessment of motor activity is often 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
included in first-tier evaluations, either as part of the FOB or as a separate quantitated 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
measurement. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
There are many different types of activity measurement devices, differing in size, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
shape, and method of movement detection (MacPhail et al., 1989). Because of the accuracy 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
and ease of calibration, devices with photocells are widely used. In general, situating the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
apparatus to minimize extraneous noise, movements, or lights usually requires that the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
recording devices be placed in light- and sound-attenuating chambers during the testing 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
period. A number of different factors, including age, gender, and time of day, can affect 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
motor activity, and should be controlled or counterbalanced. Different strains of animals 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
may have significantly different basal levels of activity, making comparisons across studies 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
difficult. A major factor in activity studies is the duration of the testing session. Motor 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
activity levels are generally highest at the beginning of the session and decrease to a low 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
level throughout the session. The rate of decline during the test session is frequently termed 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
``habituation.'' 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Motor activity measurements are typically included as part of a battery of tests to 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
detect or characterize neurotoxicity. Agent-induced alterations in motor activity associated 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
with overt signs of toxicity (e.g., loss of body weight, systemic toxicity) or occurring in non-dose-related fashion
are of less concern than changes that are dose dependent, related to 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
structural or other functional changes in the nervous system, or occur in the absence of life-threatening toxicity
and are generally convincing evidence of neurotoxicity.

4.3.2.3. Neuromotor function. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 -->
Motor dysfunction is a common neurotoxic effect, and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
many different types of tests have been devised to measure time- and dose-dependent effects. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Anger (1984) reported 14 motor effects of 89 substances, which could be classified into four 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
categories: weakness, incoordination, tremor, and myoclonia or spasms. Chemical-induced 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
changes in motor function can be determined with relatively simple techniques such as the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
FOB. More specialized tests to assess weakness include measures of grip strength, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
swimming endurance, suspension from a hanging rod, discriminitive motor function, and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
hindlimb splay. Rotarod and gait assessments measure incoordination, while rating scales 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
and spectral analysis techniques quantify tremor and other abnormal movements (Tilson and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Mitchell, 1984). 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
An example of a second-tier procedure to assess motor function has been described by 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Newland (1988), who trained squirrel monkeys to hold a bar within specified limits (i.e., 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
displacement) to receive positive reinforcement. The bar was also attached to a rotary 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
device, which allowed measurement of chemical-induced tremor. Spectral analysis was used 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
to characterize the tremor, which was found to be similar to that seen in humans exposed to 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
neurotoxicants or with such neurologic diseases as Parkinson's disease. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Incoordination and performance changes can be assessed with procedures that measure 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
chemical-induced alterations in force (Fowler, 1987). The accuracy of performance may 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
reflect neuromotor function and is sensitive to the debilitating effects of many psychoactive 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
drugs (Walker et al., 1981; Newland, 1988). Gait, an index of coordination, has been 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
measured in rats under standardized conditions and can be a sensitive indication of specific 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
damage to the basal ganglia and motor cortex (Hruska et al., 1979) as well as damage to the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
spinal cord and peripheral nervous system. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Procedures to characterize chemical-induced motor dysfunction have been used 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
extensively in neurotoxicology. Most require preexposure training (including alterations of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
motivational state) of experimental animals, but such tests might be useful, in as much as 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
similar procedures are often used in assessing humans.

4.3.2.4. Sensory function. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 -->
Alterations in sensory processes (e.g., paresthesias and visual or 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
auditory impairments) are frequently reported signs or symptoms in humans exposed to 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
toxicants (Anger, 1984). Several approaches have been devised to measure sensory deficits. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Data from tests of sensory function must be interpreted within the context of changes in body 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
weight, body temperature, and other physiological endpoints. Furthermore, many tests 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
assess the behavioral response of an animal to a specific sensory stimulus; such responses are 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
usually motor movements that could be directly affected by chemical exposure. Thus, care 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
must be taken to determine whether proper controls were included to eliminate the possibility 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
that changes in response to a sensory stimulus may have been related to agent-induced motor 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
dysfunction.
