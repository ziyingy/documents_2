The season's fifth tropical storm may be born by this morning, a hurricane 
specialist said, as a tropical depression moving west-northwest through the 
open Atlantic gained strength through the night. "The environment is not ideal, 
but we wouldn't be surprised to see it become a tropical storm," said Hal 
Gerrish, a specialist at the National Hurricane Center in Miami. The center of 
the depression was located about 1,400 miles southwest of the Azores, the 
center said. The depression was moving near 20 m.p.h. with maximum sustained 
winds near 35 m.p.h. -- just 4 m.p.h. shy of tropical storm strength. If the 
depression reaches tropical storm strength, it would be named Erin.
