Cosco, Inc.; Denial of Petition For Determination of Inconsequential Noncompliance
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Cosco, Inc. (Cosco) of Columbus, Indiana determined that some of its child safety seats failed to comply with the flammability
requirements of 49 CFR 571.213, ``Child Restraint Systems,'' Federal Motor Vehicle Safety Standard No. 213, and
filed an appropriate report pursuant to 49 CFR part 573. Cosco also petitioned to be exempted from the notification
and remedy requirements of the National Traffic and Motor Vehicle safety Act (15 U.S.C. 1381 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
et seq.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
) on the basis that the noncompliance is inconsequential as it relates to motor vehicle safety.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Notice of receipt of the petition was published on July 7, 1993, and an opportunity afforded for comment (58 FR 36510).
No comments were received. This notice denies the petition.

Paragraph S5.7 of Standard No. 213 states that ``[e]ach material used in a child restraint system shall conform to
the requirements of S4 of FMVSS No. 302 (571.302).'' Paragraph S4.3(a) of Standard No. 302 states that ``[w]hen tested
in accordance with S5, material described in S4.1 and S4.2 shall not burn, nor transmit a flame front across its surface,
at a rate of more than 4 inches per minute.''

Between November 1, 1989, and March 31, 1993, Cosco produced 133,897 add-on (as opposed to built-in) child restraint
seats, with shoulder harness straps which it has determined do not comply with the flammability requirements of Standard
No. 213. The principal restraining mechanism on the noncompliant seats is a soft-shield harness assembly. The soft-shield
harness assembly consists of a buckle, a soft molded urethane shield, and two straps, protruding to the top of the shield,
which go over the child's shoulders through slots in the back of the child restraint and attach to a metal bar, which
in turn is attached to an adjustment strap. Indications of a possible noncompliance came to light during testing of
the seats by NHTSA at Detroit Testing Laboratory in February 1993, and retesting at U.S. Testing Laboratory. The harness
straps burned at a rate of 4.3 inches per minute. This formed the basis of NHTSA investigation NCI 3269.

Cosco supported its petition for inconsequential noncompliance with the arguments set forth below. Cosco also submitted
photographs of the noncompliant seats, photographs of the tests being conducted on the seats, and test data. These
materials were available for review in the NHTSA docket during the comment period.

generally that requiring child restraints to meet the [FMVSS] 302 standard does further the purpose of the standard
when considering such child restraint components as vinyl or fabric pads or their foam contents. Cosco also concedes
that the applicability of the standard to the harness systems of certain child restraints furthers the purpose of
the standard, such as five-point harness systems which attach to, or pass through, the seating surface of the child
restraint where sources of ignition such as cigarettes or matches could become entrapped.

Cosco's principal argument dealt with the improbability that the restraints would ignite. In support of this, it
submitted that:

[I]t is not physically possible for the harness straps of the soft shield to ignite or burn unless the entire child restraint
or the automobile seat upon which it is installed is already burning.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The configuration and placement of the straps of the Cosco soft-shield assembly are such that these straps cannot
come into contact with an independent source of ignition, such as a cigarette or match, which would result in any burning
of the harness strap.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
These are the only two possible causes for the ignition of the shoulder straps of Cosco soft-shield child restraints.
The first is fire already consuming the child restraint and/or the vehicle seat upon which the child restraint is installed
is on fire. It cannot be seriously questioned that, in such an instance, the child would be seriously or fatally burned
from these sources of fire as opposed to the shoulder straps of the child restraint contributing in any degree to the
child's injury. Cosco retained John E. Pless, M.D., Director of Forensic Pathology, Department of Pathology, Indiana
University, School of Medicine, to review this issue. Dr. Pless, one of the leading forensic pathologists in the country
and, through his work with Riley Children's Hospital in Indianapolis, one of the most experienced pediatric pathologists,
concludes that the webbing of the Cosco soft-shield child restraints would have no practical importance on the effects
of such a fire on a child. [Dr. Pless' report and curriculum vitae are in the docket.] Dr. Pless' conclusions are supported
by tests performed by Cosco [photographs of the tests are in the docket.] The tests establish that the webbing does
not ``ignite'' as that term is commonly understood. The webbing burns in a fashion that can be more accurately described
as smoldering and generally extinguishes itself after a brief period of time. It should be noted that the tests *&blank;*&blank;*
do not reflect any possible ignition of the child restraint harness straps if the child restraint were occupied by
a child. [Cosco believes t]here is simply no way for a source of ignition, such as a lighter, to come into contact with
the strap *&blank;*&blank;* when the child restraint is occupied by a child.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The other possible source of ignition of the harness strap would be from a localized heat source, such as a match or cigarette.
It is critical in the analysis of whether such a risk exists to examine the configuration and placement of the straps
of the Cosco soft-shield child restraints. [T]hese straps only contact the child who is occupying the child restraint
at the mid-chest level, or higher on the child's body. The straps are essentially vertical as they leave the shield.
Cosco conducted tests attempting to ignite the harness strap with a burning cigarette. [Photographs of this test
are in the docket.] Simply stated, a lighted cigarette cannot ignite the harness strap. Cosco conducted these tests
under controlled conditions which, frankly, seemed inconceivable to occur in the actual use of child restraints.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
For example, in order to come into contact, for any length of time, with the child restraint harness strap, a lighted
cigarette would have to be balanced at the point where the strap emerges from the molded shield. This is so unlikely
as to be virtually inconceivable. Dr. Pless also commented on this possibility and indicated that such a localized
heat source is ``not within the realm of practical consideration.'' Cosco believes that any practical examination
of these issues concludes that the risk of the ignition of the harnesses of Cosco soft-shield child restraints could
not, under any conceivable set of circumstances, result in injury or death to the occupant of the child restraint.
The noncompliance of Cosco soft-shield child restraints is therefore inconsequential as it relates to motor vehicle
safety as set forth in FMVSS 302.
