  [Text] Tallinn, Apr 15, BNS -- The Estonian Government at 
its meeting on Thursday [14 April] approved a bill on the 
introduction of temporary travel documents for non-citizens. 
  The documents are to be issued to Estonia's permanent 
non-citizen residents who can no more travel with their Soviet 
passports. The document will be valid only for once leaving 
Estonia and one entry into the country. A new document has to 
be applied for if the holder wants to cross the border again, 
the draft stipulates. 
  The document will be valid for six months from issue and can 
be used only when travelling to countries which accept it as a 
travel document and put their visas in it. 
  The temporary travel document is a document for the 
transition period until Estonia introduces its aliens' 
passports, said Aino Leppik, adviser to the government. 
  Aliens' passports are currently in print and the country 
expects to start their issue in summer, she added.
