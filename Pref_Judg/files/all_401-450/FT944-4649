Burmeister &amp; Wain, the troubled Copenhagen shipyard, has abandoned plans for
co-operation with Kockums, the Swedish shipyard in Malmo, across the straits
from the Danish capital.
Plans for integrated co-operation between the Danish and Swedish yards,
which included evaluation of a new joint shipyard company, were announced
last month, but the yards said yesterday they could not find a satisfactory
financial basis for co-operation.
However, the Danish yard, with about 1,700 employees, said it hoped to
strengthen its financial position by selling its shares in shipping company
BurWain Tankers International, in which it has a 70 per cent holding.
The yard has built ships on a speculative basis for the shipping company,
whose losses are contributing to the group's problems.
It also said it was in negotiations with American insurance companies to
restructure a dollar loan. However it said the financing of work on six bulk
carriers, which the yard has on order, is being provided by its banks.
B&amp;W Holding shares fell DKr10 to DKr45 yesterday, compared with DKr394 at
the end of last year.
