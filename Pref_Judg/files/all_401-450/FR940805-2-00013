SUMMARY:

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
 DOE announces its intent to prepare a Site-wide Environmental Impact Statement (SWEIS) for the Rocky Flats Environmental
Technology Site (formerly known as the Rocky Flats Plant) located near Golden in Jefferson County, CO. The SWEIS is
being prepared pursuant to the National Environmental Policy Act (NEPA), as amended (42 USC 4321 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=3 -->
et seq.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
), and in accordance with the Council on Environmental Quality Regulations for Implementing the Procedural Provisions
of NEPA (40 CFR Parts 1500-1508) and the DOE NEPA Implementing Procedures (10 CFR Part 1021).

SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
 Rocky Flats, a Federal Government-owned, contractor-operated facility near Golden, Colorado, began operations
in 1952. The site's primary mission was the production of component parts for nuclear weapons. Key production activities
involved the fabrication of parts from plutonium, uranium, and nonradioactive metals, such as beryllium, stainless
steel, and aluminum. Components made at Rocky Flats were shipped elsewhere for assembly. Components from obsolete
nuclear weapons were disassembled and processed to recover plutonium and americium (a by-product of plutonium radioactive
decay). Enriched uranium components were separated and shipped elsewhere for recycling. In support of weapon component
fabrication, Rocky Flats operated facilities for the storage, treatment, and transport of waste; chemical laboratories;
research and development facilities; and special support operations for other DOE facilities.

In the process of fulfilling its national security mission, Rocky Flats generated waste materials that have contaminated
soils, groundwater, and surface water with chemical and radioactive substances. In 1989, Rocky Flats was placed
on the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency's National Priorities List under the Comprehensive Environmental
Response, Compensation, and Liability Act of 1980, as amended. Cleanup, decontamination, and restoration of Rocky
Flats is part of DOE's overall commitment to properly and safely manage sites under DOE's stewardship and to reduce
or eliminate risks to the environment and public health and safety. These activities are being conducted at Rocky
Flats under an Interagency Agreement regarding the remedial cleanup of Rocky Flats between DOE, the U.S. Environmental
Protection Agency, and the Colorado Department of Health. This agreement is currently under renegotiation as the
Rocky Flats Cleanup Agreement.

Rocky Flats will have completed a transition from a weapons complex site to one that has predominantly an environmental
restoration and waste management mission by the end of fiscal year 1994 (September 30, 1994). The only weapons complex
function still performed by the facility is the manufacture of a number of nonnuclear parts for nuclear weapons. As
a result of the recent decision to consolidate the weapons complex nonnuclear manufacturing activities, the remaining
weapons complex activities at the site will be terminated at the end of fiscal year 1994, and will be moved to the Department's
Kansas City Plant. Thus, the new mission of the site will be to clean up and convert Rocky Flats to beneficial uses in
a manner that is safe, environmentally and socially responsible, physically secure and cost-effective. In light
of these changes, the name of the facility has recently been changed from the Rocky Flats Plant to the Rocky Flats Environmental
Technology Site.

As defined in the DOE NEPA Implementing Procedures, a SWEIS is a broad-scope, programmatic NEPA document that identifies
and assesses the individual and cumulative environmental effects of ongoing and reasonably foreseeable future
actions at a DOE site. A SWEIS may be used to assess potential effects related to changes in overall operational mode
or mission. Subsequent, project-specific NEPA documents may be tiered from a SWEIS, and general information included
in the SWEIS can be incorporated by reference into project-specific NEPA documents. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Rocky Flats SWEIS is being prepared to update and replace the April 1980, Final Environmental Impact Statement
for the Rocky Flats Plant Site 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(DOE/EIS&hyph;0064), and to provide a basis for selection of a site-wide strategic approach to implementing Rocky
Flats' change in mission from production of nuclear weapons components to nuclear materials storage, waste management,
cleanup, and economic conversion. The SWEIS will also support project level decisions within the next 5&hyph;10
years regarding land use, management of nuclear materials, deactivation of Rocky Flats facilities, decontamination
and decommissioning of existing facilities for conversion to beneficial uses, need for additional waste storage
facilities, and possible onsite and offsite transportation of radioactive, hazardous and mixed wastes. This NOI
provides a proposed action and two alternatives for public review and comment.
