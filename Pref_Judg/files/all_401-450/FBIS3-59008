<F P=106> [Article signed ABS (ADB): "Expected Postponement of </F>
Schengen Measures Until Latter Half of Year"; as released by 
Brussels BELGA Database] 
  [Text] Brussels, 14 Jan (BELGA) -- The implementation of 
the Schengen accords (Benelux, France, Germany) on exempting 
travelers from controls at stations, ports, and airports is 
unlikely to take effect before next July. Belgian aviation 
circles (Sabena, BATC, aviation authorities) and the European 
Affairs Ministry (office of Robert Urbain) expect this further 
delay following the postponement of deadlines set previously (1 
November 1993 and 1 February 1994). 
  The software of the central computer (in Strasbourg) 
containing vital programs for identification, formalities, and 
other control operations linked to the application of Schengen 
are apparently not yet perfected and do not permit a normal 
functioning of equipment. 
  The decision has therefore been made in principle to 
postpone 
once again the application of the accords. But it is not until 
a meeting of the relevant European ministers -- scheduled for 
February -- that a decision may be made on the exact date for 
implementing the accords. It seems this date will be in the 
second half of 1994, according to a spokesman for Mr. Urbain. 
  A Sabena spokesman believes the application of Schengen is 
now likely to be very close to the date for the final opening 
(next November) of the new Brussels-National air terminal, which 
would simplify the problem of making provisional arrangements in 
the old airport terminal to separate the flow of passengers 
coming from or going to the five Schengen countries. If there 
remains just a short period between the new date of entry into 
force of Schengen and the opening of the Brussels airport 
terminal, the aviation authorities believe a pragmatic solution 
could certainly be found, making it possible to apply the 
provisions of the accord (almost total elimination of the risk 
of fraud, and in particular the exchange of travel documents 
between Schengen and non-Schengen passengers) to a sufficiently 
effective degree for a few months. 
  The Schengen accord is soon to be extended to include 
Portugal and -- in subsequent stages -- Greece and Spain, and 
finally the British Isles and Denmark.
