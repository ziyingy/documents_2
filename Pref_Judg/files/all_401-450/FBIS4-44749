  [Text] Enschede--The Mesa Institute of the Technical 
University [of Enschede] by chance discovered bacteria that can 
etch chips. The research group Biosensors has been 
experimenting for quite some time with silicon sensors on which 
a layer of biologically active material was applied as a 
breeding gound for enzymes and bacteria. By accident the 
bacteria of the strain Coli Silica Etcherca appeared to affect 
the silicon material. This property is now being used to etch 
chips. The biological material is kept on the "right track" by 
applying lethal chemicals on the interfaces. Meanwhile, 
miniature microphones have been manufactured using this new 
method.
