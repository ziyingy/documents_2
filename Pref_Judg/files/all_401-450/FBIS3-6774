  [Excerpts] Gunhin, alias Kyar Lay, commander of the 203d 
Battalion of the ABSDF [All Burma Students Democratic Front] 
armed organization in the jungle, together with his wife, Ma Yee 
Yee Aye, and a two-year old daughter surrendered at the Myanmar 
[Burmese] Embassy in Bangkok, Thailand, and returned to Yangon 
[Rangoon] on 9 March. [passage omitted] 
  Gunhin was involved in the 1988 events and fled to the 
border 
on 5 November 1988. He arrived at the Bodaw camp of the 10th 
Battalion of the Karen armed organization in the jungle via 
Ranong in the country on the other side [Thailand] and later 
joined the ABSDF 203d Battalion formed at the camp. Ma Yee Yee 
Aye is a member of the medical unit of the ABSDF 203d Battalion 
in the Minthamee camp of the KNU [Karen National Union]. 
[passage omitted] 
  Gunhin resigned as commander of the 203d Battalion following 
an argument with the camp administration and later went to 
Bangkok, where he drew a monthly refugee allowance from the [UN] 
High Commission for Refugees and performed odd jobs. He said 
that he decided to return to the legal fold after hearing about 
the developments in Myanmar while in Bangkok and the warm 
welcome and reception accorded by the government to the 
returnees. [passage omitted] 
  The government is still keeping the reception centers open 
and welcoming youths who fled to the country on the other side 
for various reasons following the 1988 events and joined armed 
organizations in the jungles. 
  After hearing the developments in the country and realizing 
the correct view, Hla Tok alias Saw Insolay, platoon commander 
of the 7th DO [expansion not known] Battalion of the Karen armed 
organization in the jungle, surrendered along with one M-16 
assault rifle, two magazines, 90 rounds of ammunition, one M-79 
rocket launcher, and one 40-mm projectile on 2 March at Palau 
garrison. 
  Similarly, Bedar alias Tun Myint, unit commander of the BCP 
[Burma Communist Party]-BTA [expansion unknown] armed 
organization, and two privates -- Myint Htay and Khin Maung Htwe 
-- surrendered along with three M-16, four M-16 magazines, 25 
rounds of ammunition, one BA-64 assault rifle, one BA-64
