The city's first automated dump trucks will begin collecting containers full of 
recyclable items Nov. 14. 
</P>
<P>
The trucks, equipped with robotic arms that hoist and empty containers, will 
collect trash every week and recyclable items twice monthly. On Nov. 6, every 
Brea resident will receive two 100-gallon containers for free, a green one for 
recyclable waste and a black one for garbage.

Newspapers, cardboard, computer paper, magazines, glass, aluminum and plastic 
containers can be stored in the green can. Each can is equivalent in size to 
four medium-size trash cans. As a result, residents will not have to segregate 
different kinds of recyclables into separate containers.

"This is an opportunity for us to control our (trash) rates in the future," 
said Patrick McCarron, director of maintenance services.

Landfill disposal fees were raised countywide in July. For Brea residents, they 
increased from $4.92 to $7.93 per month. Because recyclables will be sold, gate 
fees at landfills will be reduced.

"It's going to take a behavior change, a modification of habits," McCarron 
said.

A test program in Anaheim identified some problems, such as trash in the wrong 
container, but nothing that cannot be resolved, city officials said.

"This is a winner for the people who live here," McCarron said. "The program 
has long-range benefits and good economic effects. JENNIFER MOULTON
