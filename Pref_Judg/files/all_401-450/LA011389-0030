In what was called the largest private "debt-for-nature" swap to date, the 
government of Costa Rica has agreed to take new steps to save its vanishing 
tropical forests in exchange for a reduction in its foreign debt, it was 
disclosed Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
Under an agreement announced in Washington, Costa Rica will not have to repay a 
$5.6-million loan it owed the American Express Bank. The bank wrote off the 
loan as a bad debt, took a tax deduction and sold the debt paper to the Nature 
Conservancy, a Washington-based private, nonprofit conservation organization, 
for $784,000. 
</P>
<P>
The Nature Conservancy and another private environmental group in Costa Rica 
then renegotiated the loan with the government. Under the new terms, the 
government will owe $1.7 million plus interest, which will be used to issue 
Costa Rican currency bonds that will finance the tropical forest preservation 
project as well as other conservation measures involving 355,000 acres. 
</P>
<P>
The exchange is the fifth such transaction and part of a developing trend in 
dealing with Third World debt while encouraging conservation of what are coming 
to be known as the "global commons," precious natural resources that are 
critical links in preventing or minimizing worldwide environmental problems 
such as global warming. 
</P>
<P>
Third World countries collectively owe $1.3 trillion in foreign debt and many 
are forced to service that debt by exploiting natural resources to earn hard 
currency to repay their loans. 
</P>
<P>
"The monumental environmental problems facing the world are going to require 
creative solutions," Jeff Wise of the Nature Conservancy said Thursday in a 
telephone interview from Washington. "Debt for nature . . . is a model for 
imaginative ways of dealing with the unimaginable -- the loss of a large 
portion of the world's animal species." 
</P>
<P>
He added that as debt-for-nature transactions increase in size, more indebted 
countries may be encouraged to participate. 
</P>
<P>
Last year, for example, a $30-million government-to-government debt-for-nature 
exchange was negotiated in Costa Rica by the Dutch government, while the World 
Wildlife Fund put together a $5.4-million package. Such exchanges were 
recommended late last year to President-elect Bush in an extensive review of 
environmental issues funded by major U.S. corporations and foundations. Ecuador 
has also made provisions for such exchanges.

While Costa Rica has the most extensive park system in the developing world 
with 11% of its land in national parks and another 14% in some protective 
status, it experiences the highest deforestation rates outside its parks of any 
country in the Western Hemisphere, the Nature Conservancy said. 
</P>
<P>
Each year, 4% of Costa Rica's total forest cover is lost to development. If 
that trend continues for a decade, the conservancy said, there would be no 
productive forest outside protected areas. 
</P>
<P>
Each year tropical forests covering an area the size of Austria are cleared and 
burned to make way for housing, agriculture and other development, according to 
Irving Mintzer of the World Resources Institute. That amounts to 54 acres each 
minute. 
</P>
<P>
It has been estimated, for example, that the burning of rain forests for 
development and agriculture contributes as much as 20% of the total human 
contribution of carbon dioxide in the atmosphere. Carbon dioxide is a major 
contributor to the so-called greenhouse effect, a postulated international 
warming trend. 
</P>
<P>
In addition, tropical forests are significant reservoirs of biological 
diversity. It has been estimated that 75% of all species on Earth are located 
in tropical regions. 
</P>
<P>
Assisting the Nature Conservancy in purchasing the $5.6-million Costa Rican 
debt were the Stroud Foundation; the Noyes Foundation; the W. Alton Jones 
Foundation; the MacArthur Foundation; the World Wildlife Fund; the National 
Parks Foundation of Costa Rica; the government of Holland; the Swedish Society 
for the Conservation of Nature, and the People's Trust for Endangered Speces 
based in Great Britain.
