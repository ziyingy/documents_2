HOW would the alternative Budget proposals affect FT readers?
A study by the Institute for Fiscal Studies shows that 48 per cent of the
population would benefit more under Labour's proposals than under the Tory
Budget. However, 17 per cent would do better under the Tories. Labour's
proposals would help the lowest paid, and would be virtually neutral for a
broad swathe of middle-income earners, according to the study.
For example, those earning between Pounds 400 and Pounds 499 are on average
Pounds 2.13 per week better off, while those earning between Pounds 500 and
Pounds 599 are Pounds 1.49 per week worse off. This is thanks mainly to the
abolition of the National Insurance contributions ceiling, which effectively
means that nobody currently earning more than Pounds 22,000 per year pays
more than Pounds 1,699 in NICs.
But only 1 per cent of those with an income of more than Pounds 1,000 per
week will be better off under Labour, according to the IFS, while 98 per
cent will be worse off. Their average weekly loss is Pounds 105.70.
Figures produced by Price Waterhouse, the accountancy firm, show how this
will work. They take as their example a family with one breadwinner with a
gross annual income of Pounds 150,000. While under the Conservative Budget
this family would only pay Pounds 48,454 in income tax at 40 per cent, under
Labour they would pay Pounds 5,070 at 40 per cent, and Pounds 54,140 at 50
per cent.
Abolition of the NIC ceiling also adds to the tax burden. Under the
Conservative Budget the National Insurance bill would be Pounds 1,699. Under
Labour this increases to Pounds 13,247.
This means that take-home pay would be reduced from Pounds 94,022 to Pounds
71,618. On the assumption that the family has two children, Labour's child
allowance proposals would reduce this difference slightly from Pounds 94,929
to Pounds 72,653. This would leave the family of four Pounds 428.38 per
week, or 23.6 per cent, worse off than under the Tory Budget. For a family
earning Pounds 100,000 gross, net pay is cut by 19.67 per cent.
Families on this income but with two earners are much less severely
affected, because they earn double the amount at only 25 per cent tax before
the higher rates become payable.
A family earning Pounds 50,000 gross annually would also pay more, although
the effect is less marked. Rather than paying Pounds 8,454 at 40 per cent,
they would pay Pounds 5,070 at 40 per cent and Pounds 4,140 at 50 per cent.
NICs would rise to Pounds 4,247.
This makes for a fall of 10 per cent in take-home pay, from Pounds 34,022 to
Pounds 30,618.
