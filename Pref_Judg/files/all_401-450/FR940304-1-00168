Life-cycle cost and net present value.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 A life-cycle cost is calculated for a unit meeting each of the candidate standard levels. For color television sets,
life-cycle costs at all standard levels are less than the baseline unit. Of the three candidate standard levels, a
unit meeting level 3 has the lowest consumer life-cycle cost. See Technical Support Document, Table 4.1. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
However, other than at the max tech level, consumers do not purchase units of the same efficiency. At each candidate
standard level, the Department determines the average change in life-cycle costs by considering only those consumers
who are being forced by the standard to move from a lower efficiency unit to one which just meets the standard level being
considered. This is done by assuming in the base case a distribution of purchases of units meeting the efficiencies
of the various standard levels. The base case distribution is based on the distribution of current sales as a function
of efficiency. As each standard level is examined, the change in life-cycle cost reported is the average change only
for affected consumers. Under this scenario, standard level 1 would cause reductions in life-cycle costs for the
average consumer of $10.97, standard level 2 would reduce average life-cycle costs by $14.52, and standard level
3 by $24.06. The lower life-cycle costs indicate that no standard level would cause any economic burden on the average
consumer. See Technical Support Document, Table 4.2.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
While DOE examined the effect of different discount rates (4, 6, and 10 percent) on the life-cycle cost curves and generally
found little impact, the Department did not consider higher discount rates, since such rates would be beyond the range
of real, after-tax rates that consumers would likely face in financing the purchase of television sets. Similarly,
DOE did not consider different energy prices, including regional prices, in the life-cycle cost analysis. Since
any standard is to be a national standard, DOE believed that national average energy prices were appropriate.

The net present value analysis, a measure of the net savings to society, indicates that standard level 1 would produce
a net present value of $0.64 billion to consumers. The corresponding net present values for levels 2 and 3 are $1.35
billion and $1.67 billion, respectively. See Technical Support Document, Table 3.6.

 As indicated above, standards will result in significant savings of electricity consumption for television sets.

Lessening of utility or performance of products.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 As indicated above, DOE established classes of products in order to assure that the standards analyzed would not lessen
the existing utility or performance of television sets.

 Television sets use electricity directly. In 1987, 2.1 percent of residential sector source electricity (or 0.22
quads) was accounted for on a national basis by television sets.

In addition, decreasing future energy demand as a result of standards will decrease air pollution. See Technical
Support Document, Appendix D of Volume A.
