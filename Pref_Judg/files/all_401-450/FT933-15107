Sir, While appreciating assertively pro-American Mr Joe Rogaly's critique of
the attack on Baghdad ('Sad about Uncle Sam', June 29), one regrets he did
not articulate the principal basis for a reasoned critique of the decision
and action, though he came very close.
Simply put, the US unilateral military action, explained under the pretext
of being 'self defence', was plainly, in the eyes of any reasonable person,
not that at all. As I summarised State Secretary Daniel Webster's letter to
Lord Palmerston, 150 years ago, in the case of The Caroline (in my book, The
Century of the World Court) there must be (a) instant, overwhelming
necessity; (b) no alternative choice of means; (c) a necessity to avoid
deliberative processes.
These lacking, the president's action was clearly illegal, a point,
regrettably, made nowhere in the US media save by Professor Alfred Rubin on
National Public Radio's 'Talk of the Nation'. Howard N Meyer,
