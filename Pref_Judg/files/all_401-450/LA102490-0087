A Fullerton police officer has received an Award of Valor from the California 
State Firemen's Assn. for his heroic efforts in saving three people from a 
burning car last New Year's Eve. 
</P>
<P>
Officer Steve Bair, 30, who has been on the force for seven years, received the 
award early this month. 
</P>
<P>
Also receiving awards for their assistance in the rescue were John Lamkin of 
Fullerton and K.C. Schwarz, a former Fullerton resident who now lives in 
Colorado. 
</P>
<P>
The three were nominated for an award by Capt. Tom Metcalfe of the Fullerton 
Fire Department, who was part of the company that responded to the rescue. 
</P>
<P>
"I think what they did was tremendous," Metcalfe said. "If it hadn't been for 
Steve and the two other citizens, there is no doubt in my mind that the three 
people in that car would have died."

At 4 p.m. on New Year's Eve, Bair was taking a report on an earlier traffic 
accident that had occurred at the intersection of Harbor Boulevard and La 
Entrada Place. He heard skidding tires and looked up to see a station wagon 
slam into a tree, trapping the driver and two passengers inside. Immediately 
after impact, the car's engine caught fire.

<P>
Running to the car, Bair was able to pull one of the occupants, who was 
unconscious, out of the back seat. A few moments later, Schwarz and Lamkin 
stopped to help Bair, and the three tried to free the driver and the other 
passenger. 
</P>
<P>
After they were unable to pull the remaining two from the wreckage, Bair ran 
back to his police car and grabbed a fire extinguisher, and was able to fend 
off the flames until firefighters arrived. 
</P>
<P>
All three victims have since recovered.

Blair, who lives in Ontario, also received the Award of Heroism last May from 
the American Legion for his part in the rescue.ERIK HAMILTON
