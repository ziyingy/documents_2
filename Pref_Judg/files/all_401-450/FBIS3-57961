<F P=106> [Interview with European Minister Alain Lamassoure by Alain </F>
Dauvergne; place and date not given: "Europe Falls Victim to 
Information Technology"] 
  [Text] 1994: Europe will once again be at the center of 
political life. Due to the European elections in June. And to 
a further enlargement, which implicates its future. Alain 
Lamassoure, European affairs minister, explains. 
  [Dauvergne] In seeking to conclude at any price the 
accession 
negotiations for Austria, Finland, Norway, and Sweden by March, 
is there not a danger of sacrificing the fundamentals in order 
to meet the deadlines ? 
  [Lamassoure] The logic is rather similar to that of the GATT 
talks: A date has been set which is a political objective. I 
do not consider that we are being unrealistic: We have two 
months left in order to settle matters with four countries, 
whereas in the case of the GATT we overcame very difficult 
problems between 16 countries in just one month. This time 
France has three objectives: - A good agreement by the date set 
-- and we will not make a problem of the maintenance of national 
traditions such as the consumption of sucking tobacco (snus) in 
Sweden; - The retention of what the Community has already 
acquired: We will be particularly firm on foreign and security 
policy (PESC). Notably with respect to three countries which 
have neutral status. They have just given a commitment to make 
the necessary changes -- which involves legislative or even 
constitutional changes; - Finally, we want to solve the 
bilateral problems which remain with some of them by that date. 
  [Dauvergne] For example? 
  [Lamassoure] We have a problem with Austria over Grundig 
[manufacture of audiovisual equipment]: This company closed its 
factory in Cretzwald, in Moselle, to transfer its activities to 
Austria, thanks to Austrian state aid. We have asked for the 
refund of 70 percent of this aid. Vienna has refused. Last 
week we therefore reintroduced customs duty on products 
manufactured in Austria by Grundig. Another dispute -- on a 
larger scale this time -- is between France and Finland in the 
sawlogs and paper sectors. Due to the 35 percent devaluation of 
the Finnish markka (between 1991 and the end of 1992), we 
recorded a strong increase in wood imports in 1992 (followed by 
a further increase of 6 percent in 1993). We are now suddenly 
faced with a situation of one sawmill closing every day in 
France. These are small firms, but all the same. In the paper 
sector, we have seen prices collapse and some large French 
companies are on the verge of bankruptcy. We have decided to 
closely monitor imports from Finland. At the same time, experts 
from both countries are going to get together to work out an 
acceptable solution. 
  [Dauvergne] Is this a precondition for the accession 
agreement? 
  [Lamassoure] That is not what I am saying. But we do want 
any bilateral problems to be settled so that negotiations, and 
then ratifications, can be completed under the very best 
conditions. 
  [Dauvergne] After several delays, the Schengen accords -- 
which will finally permit the free movement of citizens between 
nine European countries -- are set to enter into force on 1 
February. You announced it. Is this deadline going to be met? 
  [Lamassoure] It is not certain. We have overcome all the 
problems relating to external border controls and the fight 
against drug trafficking. The political and legal problems have 
therefore been solved. But a technical problem remains: the 
functioning of the data processing system (charged to Sema, 
Siemens and Bull). We have appointed two experts -- one French 
and one German -- who will be submitting their final report in 
early January. We need to find out what is at the origin of 
these difficulties -- which are affecting certain software 
programs -- and what can be done to correct them as soon as 
possible. Later, we must look at the circumstances surrounding 
the conclusion of the contract and the selection of this group. 
But in the meantime it is unlikely that the deadline of 1 
February will be respected. 
  [Dauvergne] Would it not save time -- these technical 
hitches 
have been creating problems for months now -- if we simplified 
the system which was initially planned ? 
  [Lamassoure] The system as planned -- a central computer 
file 
linked to national files -- is no doubt too complicated. But, 
unfortunately, that is the system laid down in the Schengen 
Treaty. A different system would mean changing the treaty and 
therefore starting the process of ratification all over again. 
You can imagine how long that would take! 
  [Dauvergne] You defend the principle of a single list of 
candidates representing the majority coalition at the European 
elections. But there is a huge gap between your view of Europe 
and that held by Philippe Seguin. 
  [Lamassoure] We are in the process of setting down in black 
and white the proposals of all concerned. The UDF [Union for 
French Democracy] has in fact already published a document and 
the RPR [Rally for the Republic] is working on one. 
Subsequently, the leaders of both parties will see if they can 
arrive at a common platform, as they did at the time of the last 
European elections in 1989 and the last legislative elections 
where a chapter of our program was devoted to Europe. 
  [Dauvergne] But the government's European project is not 
very 
clear for the moment.... 
  [Lamassoure] The government's policy has consisted of 
adopting -- on each subject -- the most European position. This 
is true of the GATT -- and God knows how many people advised us 
to adopt different positions. And it is true for foreign and 
security policy: It is France and the present government which 
is defending the role of the WEU [Western European Union] in 
relation to the Atlantic Alliance, and which wants to see the 
European defense identity recognized at the NATO summit on 10 
January in Brussels. As to the reform of the institutions of the 
European Union, that is not a matter for the present government 
as it is planned for 1996. We simply ask that the next 
enlargement which is set for 1995 should not be allowed to 
compromise the proper functioning of the Community. We 
therefore want the number of votes required to obtain a blocking 
minority at the Council of Ministers to be increased from 23 -- 
the present figure in the Community of Twelve -- to 27 when we 
become the Community of Sixteen. This is a very important point 
on which the British, for the moment, disagree.
