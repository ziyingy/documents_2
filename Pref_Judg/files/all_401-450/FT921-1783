CHINA recorded its biggest budget deficit last year, which puts severe
financial restraints on its capacity to fund the rapid economic development
called for by elder statesman Deng Xiaoping.
In a budget statement to China's annual parliament, the National People's
Congress, at the weekend, the finance minister reported an unprecedented
deficit of 21.11bn yuan (Pounds 2.8bn), 8.76bn yuan over the planned figure.
The minister, Wang Bingqiang, blamed the deficit increase on a combination
of factors, including last year's devastating floods, which led to a fall in
revenues and a 10bn yuan disaster relief bill.
Support for loss-making state enterprises was a drain, costing the central
budget more than 50bn yuan in subsidies. An additional 37bn yuan went in
compensation for price increases which are aimed at bringing grain and oil
prices more in line with the market.
Wang spoke of China's 'financial difficulties' reflecting deep structural
problems in the economy. He blamed 'poor economic performance, the
irrational pattern of distribution of income, overstaffing in government
organs and the burden of subsidies.'
Budgetary constraints will make it difficult to fund the infrastructure
needed for high speed development. They could also delay the start of
construction of the 57bn yuan Three Gorges dam on the Yangtze.
Forecasts for 1992 show a budget shortfall only marginally less than in
1991. Wang said fulfilling the targets for 1992 would be an uphill climb. A
supporter of Chen Yun, who leads the conservative opponents of the Deng
Xiaoping rapid development line, Mr Wang called for financial discipline and
strict control over expenditure.
The only exceptions to the belt-tightening are military expenditure, up 12
per cent to 37bn yuan, and education, up just over 11 per cent.
