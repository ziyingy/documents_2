  [Text] Yichang, January 5 (XINHUA) -- The preparatory 
projects for the mammoth Three Gorges water conservancy and 
power project are going full steam ahead in the new year. 
  The central government is ready to increase markedly the 
investment in the projects. 
  He Gong, deputy general manager of the China Chang Jiang 
River Three Gorges Project Development Corporation, said that 
the bidding for 13 large projects involving a total amount of 
2.7 billion yuan has been completed. 
  He said that more than 100 engineering companies bid against 
each other for a special highway project and 12 other projects. 
All the competitors are highly regarded Chinese firms in the 
field of engineering construction. 
  The gigantic three gorges water conservancy and power 
project 
is expected to be the world's second largest when finished. It 
will require an estimated 50.09 billion yuan in investment and 
will take 18 years to complete.
