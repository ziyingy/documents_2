  [Text] U.S. Assistant Secretary of State Robert Gelbard 
Monday [4 April] contended that the Islamic Republic of Iran, 
Nigeria, Burma, and Syria are either collaborating in drug 
trafficking or are not taking preventive steps in this regard. 
  Of course this is not the first time that Washington has 
levelled such charges in an attempt to counter the independent 
policy of the Islamic Republic of Iran. In the past, too, 
propaganda tactics such as production of nuclear weapons, aiding 
international terrorism, and violation of human rights have been 
repeated time and again. 
  Apparently, the U.S. State Department has asserted a new 
charge on account of the earlier subjects getting old. This 
subject alleges that Iran has not helped prevent the drug 
trafficking destined for Europe and America. The charge is 
being levelled at a time when numerous reports have already been 
released by international agencies on the successful campaign 
launched by the Islamic Republic of Iran against production and 
sale of drugs. Included among them are the recent comments of 
Mr. George Canary, executive director of the UN drug control 
program stationed in Vienna [name and title as received]. He 
has declared that Iran is making fervent efforts to combat drug 
trafficking. Also mention can be made of the recent report of 
the international department for drug control, whose officials 
toured the bordering areas of Iran and Pakistan. The report, 
which has been released as an official document of the United 
Nations, has said: Even though Iran is not at the highest level 
in terms of per capita investment on drug control, it is very 
close to this point. The report also stresses that the Islamic 
Republic of Iran is actively carrying out an anti-drug campaign 
on regional and international level. 
  It should be mentioned that Islamic Iran, which is itself a 
victim of the attacks by the drug traffickers, has launched 
widescale efforts to combat the merchants of death during the 
past years, and tens of thousands of its security forces have 
laid down their lives in fighting the drug traffickers who try 
to smuggle narcotics from Pakistan and Afghanistan to Europe and 
the United States. 
  Official figures indicate that the amount of narcotics 
seized 
in 1979 stood at 11,000 tonnes, whereas in 1992 it reached 
66,000 tonnes, which reflects a remarkable success. More 
interesting is the fact that when the Islamic Republic of Iran, 
in order to uproot the drug trafficking, brings to the gallows 
the drug lords who have been involved in the trade for years, 
the U.S. Administration and its allies condemn Iran for 
violating the human rights. 
  In the end, one can only say that in this connection 
Washington's political scandals are so clear that there is 
hardly any need for a further look at its performance. It would 
suffice to remind that it is the United States where the heroin 
manufacturing plant makers are living, and where the big drug 
barons are based with their widescale resources.
