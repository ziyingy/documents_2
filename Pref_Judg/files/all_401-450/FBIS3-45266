  [Text] Nanchang, January 13 (XINHUA) -- East China's 
Jiangxi Province is spreading family planning knowledge through 
spare time schools. 
  Zhu Jufang, deputy director of Jiangxi Provincial Family 
Planning Commission, said that in 1,782 townships, towns and 
plants in the province, there are now 2,027 family planning 
schools with 10,500 teachers. 
  She said that most of the schools are equipped with color 
TV's, tape recorders and other modern teaching facilities. 
  The schools give classes to and provide textbooks for people 
according to sex, age, occupation and marital status. 
  Up to now, about 2.2 million people have received 
instruction 
in the schools. 
  The family-planning education effectively raised people's 
understanding of family planning policies and more and more 
people have begun to abandon traditional birth concepts.
