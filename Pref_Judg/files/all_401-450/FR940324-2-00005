29 manufacturers/exporters and the period April 27, 1990 through August 31, 1991.

On September 24, 1990, the Department of Commerce (the Department) published in the 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 -->
Federal Register
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 (55 FR 39036) the antidumping duty order on sweaters wholly or in chief weight of man-made fiber (MMF sweaters) from
Hong Kong. On September 30, 1991, the petitioner, the National Knitwear &amp; Sportswear Association (NKSA), requested
that we conduct an administrative review, in accordance with section 751(a) of the Tariff Act of 1930, as amended (the
Tariff Act) and 19 CFR 353.22(a). We published the notice of initiation of the antidumping duty administrative review
on October 18, 1991 (56 FR 52254), covering the period April 27, 1990 through August 31, 1991. On December 3, 1993 the
Department published the preliminary results in the

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 -->
Federal Register
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 (58 FR 63913). The initiation notice named 31 companies. Of these 31 companies, we terminated the review of two companies,
which had requested review of their own shipments, but later withdrew those requests. (See ``Termination of Review
in Part'' section of the preliminary results notice.) Of the remaining 29 companies the following four companies
were selected to be analyzed, using sampling techniques: Apace Knitting Factory (Apace), Bond Manufacturing Co.,
Ltd. (Bond), Hayward Knitters (Hayward), and LaMagma, Ltd. (LaMagma). The other companies covered by this review
preliminarily received a rate which was the simple average of the margins of these four companies.

Four exporters, Peninsula Knitters Ltd. (Peninsula), Fang Brothers Knitting Limited (Fang), Sun Hing Knitting
Factory Limited (Sun Hing) and Comitex Knitters Limited (Comitex), and the Hong Kong Woollen &amp; Synthetic Knitting
Manufacturers' Association, (Peninsula et al.) submitted a joint case brief. Susan Bristol, Inc. (Bristol) an importer,
submitted a case brief. No party submitted a rebuttal brief. The Department has now completed this administrative
review in accordance with section 751 of the Tariff Act.

Scope of the Review 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Imports covered by this review are shipments of MMF sweaters from Hong Kong. MMF sweaters are defined as garments for
outerwear that are knitted or crocheted, in a variety of forms including jacket, vest, cardigan with button or zipper
front, or pullover, usually having ribbing around the neck, bottom, and cuffs on the sleeves (if any), encompassing
garments of various lengths, wholly or in chief weight of man-made fiber. The term ``in chief weight of man-made fiber''
includes sweaters where the man-made fiber material predominates by weight over each other single textile material.
This excludes sweaters 23 percent or more by weight of wool. It includes men's, women's, boys', or girls' sweaters,
as defined above, but does not include sweaters for infants 24 months of age or younger. It includes all sweaters as
defined above, regardless of the number of stitches per centimeter, provided that, with regard to sweaters having
more than nine stitches per two linear centimeters horizontally, it includes only those with a knit-on rib at the bottom.

Garments which extend below mid-thigh or cardigans that contain a sherpa lining or heavy-weight fiberfill lining,
including quilted linings, used to provide extra warmth to the wearer, are not considered sweaters and are excluded
from the scope of the order. Also specifically excluded from the scope are sweaters assembled in Guam that are produced
from knit-to-shape component parts knit in and imported from Hong Kong and entering under Harmonized Tariff Schedule
(HTS) item number 9902.61.
