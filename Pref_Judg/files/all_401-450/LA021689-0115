A quick, 10-word memory test developed by researchers to help identify 
Alzheimer's patients in early stages of the brain disorder has won praise from 
the American Medical Assn. The test, which takes less than 10 minutes, seems to 
be "a brief, efficient and accurate means of predicting Alzheimer's" in elderly 
patients, the AMA said in a statement. The 10 words used in the test are 
chimney, salt, harp, button, meadow, train, flower, finger, rub and book. The 
University of Minnesota researchers who developed the test report that it is 
95.2% accurate in distinguishing elderly people with early signs of Alzheimer's 
disease from those with no sign of mental impairment. Most of the Alzheimer's 
patients were able to recall no more than two of the words when tested on their 
memory of them.
