The space shuttle Columbia was expected back on Earth late Monday night, 
carrying a crew that overcame telescope-pointing problems and a threatening 
backup of waste water to squeeze a surprising amount of science from a mission 
that at times seemed jinxed. 
</P>
<P>
An approaching cold front bringing threatening weather forced NASA officials to 
cut the mission short by one day. The night landing, which ends the 38th 
shuttle mission and the 10th flight for Columbia, was to be the fourth in 
shuttle history. 
</P>
<P>
The launch of the shuttle was plagued by delays and the mission hampered by 
technical problems but nevertheless yielded significant astronomical data. 
</P>
<P>
Shortly after the launch, both computers that were to point the four telescopes 
that study ultraviolet light and X-rays and lock them on their targets failed 
to work. The crew later found that lint clogging the air vents caused both 
computers to overheat. 
</P>
<P>
The astronauts overcame the potentially mission-threatening glitch by working 
with technicians at Mission Control at the Marshall Space Flight Center in 
Huntsville, Ala., who radioed commands to point the telescopes in the general 
direction of their targets. Then the astronomers, working with a joystick 
similar to those used on video games, aimed the telescopes and locked them on 
target.

Later, National Aeronautics and Space Administration officials thought they 
would have to cut the flight short by one day because the drain tube for the 
waste disposal system jammed. The crew had to pump the waste water into plastic 
bags, restoring the system to working capacity.

NASA spokesman Don Haley acknowledged that "as far as problems that were 
visible," this mission was probably the most trouble-plagued flight other than 
the Challenger explosion. 
</P>
<P>
Despite the difficulties, NASA officials are elated at the volume of data the 
telescopes have yielded. "They collected more science than scientists and 
astronomers can assimilate," Haley said. 
</P>
<P>
The Astro Observatory aboard the Columbia contains four telescopes that can 
detect X-rays and ultraviolet light that are obscured by the Earth's 
atmosphere. They provided scientists with valuable data on various planets, 
stars and galaxies. 
</P>
<P>
Two of the telescopes also provided unprecedented evidence that indicates the 
existence of black holes. 
</P>

Monday night, scientists reflected on their roller-coaster nine days at 
Marshall Space Flight Center. "For the scientists, we're just beginning" to 
study all the exciting data collected, said mission scientist Theodore Gull, 
who said he "broke down" after the emotional conclusion of science activity. 
"We know we are going to help rewrite the textbooks." 
</P>
<P>
Despite the telescope-pointing problems, which meant only 135 of 250 planned 
observations were made, the science part of the mission ended on the upswing, 
with the astronauts targeting a fast-moving comet just minutes before the three 
ultraviolet instruments were shut down. 
</P>
<P>
The workhorse Broad Band X-ray Telescope -- built at Goddard Space Flight 
Center and pointed independent of the Astro crew from a control room at the 
Greenbelt, Md., center -- operated for several more hours, taking a final look 
at a distant galaxy.

"We went out with a bang," said Arthur Davidsen, who heads the team that built 
the Hopkins Ultraviolet Telescope at Johns Hopkins University. 
</P>

The skipper of the Columbia is Vance D. Brand, 58, who is completing his fourth 
shuttle mission. Other crew members are pilot Guy S. Gardner, mission 
specialists Jeffrey A. Hoffman, John M. Lounge, Robert A. R. Parker, and 
payload specialists and civilian astronomers Samuel T. Durrance and Ronald A. 
Parise.
