The Rev Susan Shipp (above), one of the first woman priests ordained by the
Church of England, celebrated communion yesterday in Bristol, as groups
opposed to their ordination warned of further splits in the church.
Thirty-three women were ordained on Saturday by the bishop of Bristol, the
Rt Rev Barry Rogerson.
The Vatican warned of a 'profound obstacle' to reunion hopes between the
Catholic church and the Anglican communion. But Rt Rev Mark Santer, bishop
of Birmingham, said he hoped traditionalists tempted to become Roman
Catholics would find it possible to stay.
One UK government minister has already converted to Catholicism over the
issue, and another has announced his intention to do so. A claim by the
latter, environment secretary John Gummer, that the Church of England had
turned itself into a 'sect' by accepting women priests was dismissed as
'incredibly insular'. by the bishop of Birmingham. Many other branches of
the Anglican church around the world already have women priests.
