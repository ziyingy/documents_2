Map, Ulysses' Twisted Course -- The Ulysses spacecraft, scheduled to be 
launched aboard the space shuttle Discovery this morning, is designed to fly 
faster than any other device ever built by human hands. It is expected to 
follow a 2-billion-mile path through the solar system so that scientists can 
see the sun from an angle they have never seen it from before. SANDY KAY / Los
