A poaching ring that involved the slaughter of more than 400 black bears in the 
Northeast was broken Tuesday with the arrests of 11 people, officials said. The 
bears were killed for their gall bladders, which are prized as aphrodisiacs in 
the Far East. The arrests were the culmination of a 2 1/2-year investigation by 
wildlife officials from Massachusetts, Connecticut, New York and the U.S. Fish 
and Wildlife Service.
