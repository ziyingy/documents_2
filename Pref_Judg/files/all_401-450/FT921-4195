Sir, With some 20 years in the shipping industry, I am not aware of any
civilian ship operator who has the budgets available to keep one ship in
harbour and one at sea, let alone who requires three ships in the harbour to
maintain one at sea at all times ('Naval chief backs fourth Trident sub',
March 6).
Ferry companies which operate in all weathers have no reserve ferries in
their peak season and even companies operating vessels at the cutting edge
of technology, Sealink's Wavepiercers for example, do not have spares.
It appears that one or more of the following possibilities applies:
The design of Trident is at fault, resulting in breakdowns.
Management and/or crewing arrangements have not moved with the times.
The decision to contemplate purchase of a fourth Trident at a time of
reduced demand is motivated by factors other than operational.
Perhaps the time has come for the government to contemplate civilian
management of the navy, leaving solely strategy and war to the admirals.
