The article "Who Was Steven?" recounted the story of a young man who had his 
innocence and boyhood stolen from him in the cruelest kind of way, who, as a 
teen-ager, was determined that the same thing wouldn't happen to the newest 
victim of kidnaper Kenneth Parnell, and who was willing to take whatever risk 
was necessary to get little 5-year-old Timmy White safely away from the abuse 
Steven had endured for seven frightening years.

Life has dealt Steven and the Stayner family one harsh blow after another. The 
hard time he had "getting his feet on the ground" is to be expected after all 
he went through. He had a lot of strangers pulling for him, from one end of the 
country to another, and his sudden death in an accident on Sept. 16 has left a 
deep sadness in many hearts.

What the story didn't mention was that Steven was a hero. It probably isn't an 
easy burden to carry but that's what he was to many of us, and that's the way 
he will always be remembered.
