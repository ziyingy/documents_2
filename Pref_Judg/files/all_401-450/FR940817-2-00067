EPA provided an opportunity for the public to submit written 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
comments.
<FOOTCITE>36</FOOTCITE>
 Many comments were received from a wide variety of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
interests, including refiners, automakers, emission control 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
manufacturers, states committees, environmental and public 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
interest groups and private citizens. Taken together, the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
comments touched on every aspect of Ethyl's application. The 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
following is a summary of the comments.

Four automakers (Ford Motor Company (Ford), General Motors 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Corporation (GM), Toyota Technical Center, U.S.A., Inc. (Toyota), 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
and Chrysler Motors Corporation (Chrysler)), the American 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Automobile Manufacturers Association (AAMA), and the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Manufacturers of Emission Controls Association (MECA) all 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
recommended denial of Ethyl's request and expressed several 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
concerns with regard to the addition of MMT to unleaded gasoline. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
First, they noted that the use of MMT will cause an increase in 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
HC emissions. Most indicated that the more stringent emissions 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
standards that began taking effect in model year 1994 will make 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
any increase in HC emissions particularly troublesome. Further, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
they stated that newer technology vehicles will likely be 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
equipped with catalysts which are nearer the engine (more 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
``closely coupled'') and that such close coupling, they stated, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
results in higher catalyst temperatures that may make the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
catalyst more prone to the deposition of manganese. These 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
commenters indicated that deposition of manganese compounds on 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the surface of the catalyst would impair the catalytic breakdown 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
of emissions from the engine, thereby decreasing catalyst 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
effectiveness. Additionally, they were concerned that MMT, even 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
at the 1/32 gpg Mn concentration requested, would plug catalysts 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
and thus reduce the surface area of the catalyst available to 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
break down emissions from the engine, especially in the case of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
vehicles operated under driving conditions which result in higher 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
temperatures such as heavy load or high speed. Under such 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
conditions, it was pointed out, the vehicle may be more prone to 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
deposition of manganese. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Ethyl indicated that the assertions that it must 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
``conclusively'' demonstrate the absence of negative effects is not 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
required by the section 211(f)(4) standard. Ethyl believes that 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
it need only demonstrate, by a preponderance of evidence, that 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the additive will not cause or contribute to the failure of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
emission control devices to comply with applicable emission 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
standards, and, further, it believes that it has made this 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
showing. Ethyl also stated that the EPA test program proposed at 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
its October 1992 workshop involving the accumulation of 65,000 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
test miles, would be sufficient for purposes of gauging the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
effect of MMT on emissions. Ethyl commented that it followed 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
this proposal in the 1992/93 test fleet, although mileage 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
accumulation has continued beyond 65,000 miles for three of the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
eight model year vehicles tested without new emission results 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
different from the trends established through 65,000 miles. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
With respect to the automakers' concerns about effect of MMT 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
on newer emission technology such as close-coupled catalysts, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Ethyl indicated that the use of the 1993 Transitional Low 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Emission Vehicle (TLEV) Honda Civic in its most recent test 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
program was intended so as to introduce a vehicle which has the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
most physically possible close-coupled emission technology (i.e., 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
one connected directly to the exhaust manifold). Despite such 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
close-coupling, Ethyl indicated that the differences in 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
hydrocarbon emissions between clear and MMT-fueled 1993 TLEV 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Honda Civics was minimal. Ethyl also indicated that this concern 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
about close-coupled catalysts completely ignores that Ethyl 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
tested two 1988 models and three 1993 models equipped with close- 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
coupled catalysts without showing any significant adverse effects 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
on emissions. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Toyota submitted data on catalysts and oxygen sensors from 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
in-use customer vehicles from Canada where MMT is used as a fuel 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
additive. Toyota believes that these catalysts and oxygen 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
sensors indicate that exhaust emissions of hydrocarbons and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
carbon monoxide are higher from catalysts/oxygen systems 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
collected in Canada than comparable catalyst/oxygen systems from 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
U.S. vehicles. Also Toyota submitted photographs of a catalyst 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
taken from a high mileage Canadian Hilux pickup truck which 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
showed plugging of the catalyst passages. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Ethyl's response to Toyota's catalyst/oxygen system data is 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
that it is not clear from the description of the Toyota test 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
results precisely what can be concluded from the test program. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Ethyl stated that, without a detailed vehicle history, there is 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
no basis to conclude that MMT had an effect on the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
catalyst/oxygen system data.
