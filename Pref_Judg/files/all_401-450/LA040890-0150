It was hard to figure what was more incongruous as the state Democratic Party 
gathered downtown Saturday -- the sight of perennially buttoned-down John K. 
Van de Kamp strutting into the Convention Center to the tune of "Johnny B. 
Goode" or the painted blue skies and fluffy clouds curtain that backed a stage 
of fussing and feuding politicians. 
</P>
<P>
"Joyful," intoned Jacques Barzaghi, the baldpated guru of convention visuals, 
when asked to explain the meaning of the 3-stories-tall painted curtain, 15 
live trees and dozens of flags that draped the stage. "Happy." 
</P>
<P>
It was only those emotions if one ignored the occasional mayhem between the two 
gubernatorial candidates, Atty. Gen. Van de Kamp and former San Francisco Mayor 
Dianne Feinstein, and the fraternal bludgeoning by other candidates competing 
for the party's weekend endorsements. 
</P>
<P>
It was, however, what all conventions are: equal parts speechifying and 
back-patting, orderly structure and unyielding disorganization, irreverent 
hokeyness and blinding optimism. 
</P>
<P>
Major candidates paraded through the convention area with their entourages of 
aides; volunteers unleashed blizzards of partisan flyers. 
</P>
<P>
Minor figures such as Franklin R. Geraty -- a much-ignored gubernatorial 
candidate who said he was "working to bring back family values" -- competed for 
space with celebrities such as actor Ed Begley Jr., an environmental activist 
and mass transit booster who apologetically admitted he still owns a car. 
</P>
<P>
"It's up for sale," he said Saturday morning, wincing. "You want to buy a nice 
Volvo?" 
</P>
<P>
If the mood the Democrats tried to espouse was all chumminess and success, 
there was ample evidence that not all was well. 
</P>
<P>
Feinstein was roundly booed when, in a convention address, she spoke of her 
support for the death penalty. She and Van de Kamp exchanged veiled snaps at 
each other while former Gov. Edmund G. Brown Jr. pleaded publicly for the two 
to cool their increasingly heated war. 
</P>
<P>
There were also reminders of the party's past disappointments. 
</P>
<P>
Along a promenade of tables groaning under heaps of position papers and 
souvenirs, delegates could pick up memorabilia left over from some of the least 
successful endeavors in political history: buttons from Michael S. Dukakis' 
1988 and Hubert H. Humphrey's 1968 presidential efforts or a long-expired 
membership in George S. McGovern's 1972 Million Member club. 
</P>
<P>
Best-sellers were predictable. "Kennedy, of course," said Max Hobbs, a 
political souvenir seller, pointing to remnants from John F. Kennedy's campaign 
of 30 years ago. 
</P>
<P>
Dukakis buttons, he explained gently, were not much in demand. "There are so 
many of them," he said. 
</P>
<P>
As conventions go, this weekend's was far smaller than the Democratic national 
convention that ushered in Kennedy's nomination in 1960 at the Los Angeles 
Sports Arena. Little more than 1,100 of the 2,700 delegates showed up, although 
party officials did receive the proxies of about 500 others, according to party 
chairman Brown. He blamed the small turnout on the expense and travel 
schedules. 
</P>
<P>
The convention did, however, live up to the party's reputation for, well, 
disorganization. Saturday's first session opened more than an hour late, and 
voting on endorsements threatened to last late into the night. 
</P>
<P>
This was supposed to be a showcase for elected officials and party leaders, but 
they did not always fare well amid the gibes of their peers. At a morning 
breakfast for environmental activists, state Controller Gray Davis thanked 
absent entertainers who work on behalf of environmental issues. 
</P>
<P>
Including, he said, turning to Assemblyman Tom Hayden (D-Santa Monica), "your 
ex-spouse there, Jane Fonda." 
</P>
<P>
Hayden reddened and stared ahead. 
</P>
<P>
Later, however, he got in a slap of his own. Segueing from a reference about 
wildlife to his introduction of Brown, Hayden cracked: "Speaking of bald 
eagles." 
</P>
<P>
Brown, 52 on Saturday and his hair a tad thinner than when he left the 
governor's office eight years ago, did not appear amused.
