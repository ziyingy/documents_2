E.O. 12866/Regulatory Flexibility Act Analysis 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Executive Order 12866 requires us to prepare an analysis for any rule that meets one of the E.O. 12866 criteria for a
significant regulatory action, that is, that may_
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Have an annual effect on the economy of $100 million or more or adversely affect in a material way the economy, a sector
of the economy, productivity, competition, jobs, the environment, public health or safety, or State, local, or tribal
governments, and communities; 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Create a serious inconsistency or otherwise interfere with an action taken or planned by another agency; 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Materially alter the budgetary impact of grants, user fees, or loan programs or the rights and obligations of recipients
thereof; or 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Raise novel legal or policy issues arising out of legal mandates, the President's priorities, or the principles set
forth in E.O. 12866. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In addition, we prepare a regulatory flexibility analysis, in accordance with the Regulatory Flexibility Act, if
the rule is expected to have a significant impact on a substantial number of small entities. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
For reasons outlined below, we do not believe this rule is economically significant nor do we believe that it will have
a significant impact on a substantial number of small entities. In addition, this rule is not inconsistent with the
actions of any other agency. However, we recognize that there are potential inconsistencies depending on what other
agencies may later propose. Several agencies are now considering issuing policies on what circumstances are likely
to lead to bias in research that is funded or relied upon by the Federal Government. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Any rule in this area has the potential to inhibit socially beneficial research, and to hamper the technological progress
so essential to the American economy and to the advance of science. We are further mindful of the importance of the requirements
in Executive Order 12866 that any new regulatory system be based on a showing that there is a significant problem requiring
regulation, that regulatory priorities be based on the degree and nature of risks, and that regulations be designed
to be cost-effective. Moreover, the Regulatory Flexibility Act requires us to minimize adverse effects not only
on small businesses and individual entrepreneurs, but also on almost all non-profit entities including universities.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In the hearings that preceded enactment of the requirement in the NIH Revitalization Act, known cases were described
in which scientists have stood to make large sums of money contingent on the positive outcome of research on a particular
product, where this fact was not known to those reviewing the research, and where bias did occur. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
We have drafted this rule to address these instances of abuse, while minimizing unnecessary burden to researchers.
We did not consider any option that would routinely require all researchers to list all of their significant assets
(unrelated to the research project), that would encourage searches for hypothetical or speculative conflicts,
that would require divestiture of ownership of a product undergoing research, or that would discourage in any way
funding grants or contracts to scientists to develop products with significant profit potential. We have not inhibited
research in any way, other than requiring that it be managed to assure that potential bias is minimized. Such management
methods are common in the sciences and impose no undue burden. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
We request comment on whether there are any provisions of the proposed rule that might inadvertently hamper socially
desirable research. For example, we have proposed allowing institutions to require that researcher employees divest
themselves of stock in companies owning products undergoing research. Conversely, if there are other types of situations
in which a financial conflict of interest has a substantial risk of biasing research results, we will consider expanding
the scope of the rule. We ask that commenters provide evidence as to magnitude and frequency of any claimed adverse
effects or loopholes. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
We do not believe that the annual costs of implementing this rule will reach as much as $1,000 an institution in staff
time, or as much as $1 million a year across all institutions. Most of the cost will arise from the several seconds or
minutes spent certifying the absence of significant financial interests for individual awards. Spread across thousands
of grantee and contractor institutions, these costs are infinitesimal. Therefore, we have determined that this
rule would not create an ``unfunded mandate'' imposed on state-owned institutions and would not trigger the requirements
of Executive Order 12875, on ``Enhancing the Intergovernmental Partnership.'' 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
For these same reasons, we certify that this rule will not have a significant economic impact on a substantial number
of small entities, and that a Regulatory Flexibility Analysis is not required.

2. Paperwork Reduction Act

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The proposed rules contain information collection requirements that are subject to review by the Office of Management
and Budget (OMB) under the Paperwork Reduction Act of 1980. Appropriate instructions for making certifications
to the PHS Awarding Components will be issued as an addendum to the instructions for applications for PHS research
funding. It is contemplated that the certification will be provided by checking a box on the application. The title,
description, and respondent description applicable to the information collection are shown below with an estimate
of the annual reporting and record-keeping burden. Included in the estimate is the time for reviewing instructions,
searching existing data sources, gathering and maintaining the data needed, and completing and reviewing the collection
of information.

Title: Responsibility of Applicants for Promoting Objectivity in Research for which Public Health Service (PHS)
Funding is Sought.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Description: The regulations would require each applicant/offeror Institution to establish procedures to avoid
the inappropriate financial interest of an Investigator involved in the design, conduct or reporting of the research
for which PHS funding is sought.

Description of Respondents: Public and private non-profit
