                      Note: Hydrosonic sensitivity is 
                      defined as 20 times the base-10 
                      logarithm of the ratio of the 
                      root-mean-square output voltage to a 
                      reference voltage of 1 V, when the 
                      hydrophonic pickup, less the 
                      preamplifier, is located within the 
                      acoustic field of a plane wave with 
                      root-mean-square pressure 1 ÊPa. For 
                      example, a -160 dB hydrophone (with 
                      a reference voltage of 1 V/ÊPa) 
                      produces an output voltage of 
                      10[.sup]-[superscript  illegible][/] 
                      V in such a field, while a 
                      sensitivity of -180 dB gives an 
                      output voltage of 10[.sup]-9[/] V. 
                      Thus -160 dB is better than -180 dB
