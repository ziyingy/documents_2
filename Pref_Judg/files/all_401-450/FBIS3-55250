  [Text] President Levon Ter-Petrosyan, in a letter sent to 
IMF Executive Director Michel Camdessou, has asked for easing 
the terms of a loan to Armenia from the IMF's stabilization fund 
intended for newly-independent states. 
  IF Note: The IMF says the loan is being delayed because of 
regional instability and fears that the funds can be used for 
non-peaceful purposes. 
  The president says Armenia is not a party in the conflict 
and 
nor is it recognized as such by the international community. He 
pledged Yerevan's commitment to establishing peace in the region. 
  Economics Minister Armen Yegiazaryan and Vice Foreign 
Minister Jirair Liparityan are due to go to Washington for a new 
round of talks with IMF officials to discuss the aid issue and 
the situation in Armenia. 
  In the meantime, the local currency, the dram, plummeted by 
30 to 40 points in Tuesday's sale. The dollar soared up to 
130-140 drams on the black market on Wednesday and 1,000 rubles 
fetched 70-75 drams. 
  Local experts say the setback follows government 
non-intervention in currency markets in the first days of the 
new year, a shrinkage in commodity supply, and the indexing of 
pay and incomes effective from January 1.
