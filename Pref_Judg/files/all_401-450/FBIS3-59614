  [Text] CLEAN is the name of a new EC-sponsored European 
development project which will examine and expand the use and 
possible applications of artificial intelligence in minimizing 
environmental damage and manufacturing costs. The project 
participants are Siemens, British Maritime Technology, and the 
Belgian University of Leuven, as well as the initial users of 
this intelligent automation technology, i.e., the Portuguese 
cellulose manufacturer "Cellulose do Caima" and the Netherlands 
paper factory "Roermond Papier." The CLEAN project will 
implement case-based learning methods to optimize the 
performance of production processes.
