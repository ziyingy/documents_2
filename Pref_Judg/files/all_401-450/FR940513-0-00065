For purposes of the fractions rule, overall partnership income is the amount by which the aggregate items of partnership
income and gain for the taxable year exceed the aggregate items of partnership loss and deduction for the year. Overall
partnership loss is the amount by which the aggregate items of partnership loss and deduction for the taxable year
exceed the aggregate items of partnership income and gain for the year. In general, all items of partnership income,
gain, loss, and deduction that increase or decrease the partners' capital accounts under &sect;1.704&hyph;1(b)(2)(iv)
are taken into account in computing overall partnership income or loss.

The proposed regulations exclude allocations of certain items_generally by disregarding those items in computing
overall partnership income or loss and the partners' allocable shares of overall partnership income or loss. In some
situations, however, items are disregarded only until an allocation is actually made. The purpose of the exclusions
is to allow ordinary economic business allocations (such as preferred returns), to avoid technical violations arising
due to the requirements of section 704(b), and to avoid foot-faults.

A. Manner in Which the Fractions Rule Is Applied 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
One commentator requested clarification regarding the prospective application of the fractions rule, especially
with respect to allocations that are taken into account only when an allocation is made. The final regulations clarify
that a partnership generally does not qualify for the fractions rule exception for any taxable year of its existence
unless it satisfies the fractions rule_both on a prospective and actual basis_for every year. The regulations also
clarify that if the partnership violates the fractions rule by reason of an allocation that the regulations provide
is ``disregarded'' or ``not taken into account'' until an actual allocation is made, the partnership is treated (subject
to the anti-abuse rule) as violating the fractions rule only for the taxable year of that actual allocation and subsequent
taxable years. The final regulations also add an example illustrating this wait-and-see approach.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The proposed regulations provide that tax items allocable under section 704(c) (or &sect;1.704&hyph;1(b)(2)(iv)(

)), are not included in computing overall partnership income or loss. The final regulations clarify that those types
of tax allocations may nonetheless be relevant in determining if the partnership violates the anti-abuse rule.

C. Exclusion of Reasonable Preferred Returns and Guaranteed Payments 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Under the exception for reasonable preferred returns, items of income and gain allocated with respect to a reasonable
preferred return for capital are disregarded in computing overall partnership income or loss for purposes of the
fractions rule. Reasonable guaranteed payments for capital or services also are disregarded. However, to qualify
for the exception, the income allocation (or the deduction of the guaranteed payment) generally must not precede
the making of the related cash payment. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The final regulations adopt a commentator's recommendation that the exception for reasonable preferred returns
should apply not only to allocations effected with items of income or gain, but also to allocations effected with overall
partnership income. In implementing this change, the regulations refer to ``an allocation of what would otherwise
be overall partnership income.'' (This technical refinement also was made to several parts of the regulation that
previously referred to allocations of overall partnership income.) This is necessary because the exclusion of an
allocated item from the computation of overall partnership income or loss for purposes of the fractions rule means
that the item is not overall partnership income or overall partnership loss. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Although the exception for reasonable preferred returns contained in the proposed regulations applies only to those
allocations made to a QO, the final regulations apply the exception to all partners. Without this change, a partnership
that paid a reasonable preferred return to both its QO and taxable partners arguably could disregard the allocations
to its QO partners in computing overall partnership income or loss, but at the same time, take the corresponding allocations
to its taxable partners into account in computing overall partnership income or loss. Although the anti-abuse rule
of the proposed regulations does not permit the excessive allocation of income or gain to the QO partners that would
result if this argument were accepted, the final regulations clarify this issue. A similar change was not called for
with respect to guaranteed payments because guaranteed payments to taxable partners automatically are excluded
from overall partnership income or loss. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The proposed regulations generally provide that a material distribution is a return of capital if it is not attributable
to the partnership's cash flow from its business operations. Concern was expressed that under this rule certain returns
on capital might inappropriately be characterized as a return of capital. There also was a separate concern that this
rule inappropriately implied that distributions of operating cash flow would generally not be respected as a return
of capital. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
To address these concerns and to reflect that capital may be returned from a number of different sources, the final
regulations provide that a designation of distributions in a written partnership agreement generally will be respected
in determining a partner's unreturned capital so long as the designation is economically reasonable. Although the
regulations do not specify when the designation must be made, timing may be relevant in determining whether the designation
is reasonable.
