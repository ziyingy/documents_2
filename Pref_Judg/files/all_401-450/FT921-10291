Parents on parade: Soldiers of the 7th British Armoured Division, the
'Desert Rats', present their 'Gulf babies' nine months after returning from
war. Normally their base at Fallingbostel, Germany, sees 12 births a month.
But in December there were 60, in January 77 and another 40 are expected
this month.
