Photo, Riding Out Storm: Tropical Storm Lili lost its hurricane status as it 
veered away from the mid-Atlantic coast, but remnants of two other storms 
created floodwaters from the Carolinas to Pennsylvania before disintegrating. 
As Lili moved north, windsurfers flocked to Cape Hatteras, N.C., above, to take 
advantage of the winds. Associated Press
