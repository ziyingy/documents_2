  [Text] Tokyo, March 16 KYODO -- The government plans to 
allow firms to set up power companies to sell electricity to 
electric power companies from spring next year, government 
officials said Wednesday [16 March]. 
  The Electicity Utility Industry Council, an advisory body to 
the international trade and industry minister, set up a panel 
Wednesday to discuss easing rules and will come up with a 
detailed plan by the end of June. 
  Currently, firms can only sell electric power that has been 
left over at power generators being used in their plants. 
  If firms are allowed to join the wholesale electricity 
market, "the competition should help lower fees for general use 
in the long term," an official at the trade ministry said. 
  Firms that have a certain standard of technology will in 
principle be allowed to freely start the business, instead of 
getting a license from the trade minister as currently required, 
the officials said.
