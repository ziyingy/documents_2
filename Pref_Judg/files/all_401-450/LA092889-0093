The annual Maritime Days celebration hoists sail in Channel Islands Harbor this 
weekend with dancing, a chowder cook-off, yacht tours and other vaguely 
nautical events. 
</P>
<P>
The centerpiece of the event, which runs from Friday to Sunday, will be a 
display of classic yachts and pre-World War II motor vessels from 11 a.m. to 4 
p.m. Saturday and Sunday. The motor vessels will be on display at Peninsula 
Park dock, while the yachts will be at West Bank dock. Boarding and tours will 
be allowed on some vessels at the owner's discretion. 
</P>
<P>
Rare, vintage vessels making an appearance include the Cheerio II, a 1931 
three-masted yawl once owned by Errol Flynn, and the Los Amigos, a 43-foot 1879 
yacht built in the Caribbean. 
</P>
<P>
The Cheerio was named the Scirocco when it was owned around 1934 by the 
cinematic swashbuckler -- who named all his yachts Scirocco, according to 
Juanita McNish, who, with her husband Dick, has owned the boat for 10 years. 
</P>
<P>
Flynn used the boat mainly for quick trips to Catalina, buying bigger craft for 
later ocean cruises, she said.

Noteworthy motor craft include the MV Deerlap, an 80-foot 1929 Hoffer-Beeching 
sailboat that has carried the likes of John F. Kennedy and Marilyn Monroe and 
has appeared in television movies, and the Sea Dog, a 55-foot 1932 Stephens 
yacht that served as a kind of floating hardware store for the owner of a 
nautical parts company. 
</P>
<P>
Overall, 13 yachts will be on display. Beginning at 10 a.m. Sunday, the yachts 
will parade through the harbor.

Kicking off the celebration is the third annual Shipwreck Party from 6 to 11
