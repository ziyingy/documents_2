  [Text] Yichang, March 14 (XINHUA) -- The mammoth three 
gorges reservoir project now being undertaken on the upper 
reaches of the Chang Jiang will help improve the water quality 
in the middle and lower reaches, according to environmentalists. 
  When the retained water is discharged from the reservoir in 
the dry seasons the extra flow will wash pollutants downstream. 
  Experts on water resources protection came to this 
conclusion 
after three years of on-the-spot investigation. 
  They said the effect is apparent in the section from the 
reservoir site near Yichang to Wuhan, the capital of central 
China's Hubei Province. 
  They started the research in 1990 in four selected sections 
along the Chang Jiang, focusing on water quality changes with 
water level fluctuations. 
  The reservoir, expected to be built over the next 15 years, 
will have a normal water level of 175 m [meters] and a total 
storage capacity of 39.3 billion cu [cubic] m.
