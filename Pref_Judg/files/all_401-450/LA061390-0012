The U.S. Department of Justice has reached an agreement with Southern 
California Edison and San Diego Gas &amp; Electric that "adequately resolves" 
antitrust issues generated by the utilities' proposed merger, Edison Executive 
Vice President John E. Bryson said. A Justice Department spokesman was not 
available for comment on the agreement.

But Bryson said that "the Justice Department's antitrust division no longer has 
any concerns" about the proposed merger's impact on utility competition in 
Southern California and the West. Merger opponents were uncertain what impact 
the agreement would have on the ongoing state Public Utilities Commission 
merger review. "We haven't seen anything in writing yet, but my understanding 
is that we're still pursuing our (antitrust) case" through the PUC, state 
attorney general's office spokeswoman Regina Birdsell said.
