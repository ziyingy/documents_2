  A German woman went on trial on 28 February in Tianjin on 
charges of trafficking nearly five kg of marijuana. Doris 
Wunsch, 37, was reportedly caught trying to board a ship to 
Japan from Tianjin on 19 July 1993 with 4.84 kg of marijuana 
concealed in a double-bottomed suitcase. 
  At the time of her arrest, Wunsch had, according to Chinese 
press reports, admitted being met in Beijing by an Austrian man 
who handed her the double-bottomed suitcase, telling her it 
contained contraband. The man, later found to be Australian, 
asked her to carry the suitcase to Japan and gave her an address 
for a second rendezvous upon arrival. The Australian reportedly 
left Beijing on 18 July. (Summary) (Hong Kong AFP in English

  The Guangdong Department of Public Security broke up a large 
drug-trafficking ring composed of criminals from Hong Kong, 
Guangdong, Yunnan, and Guangxi through arrests over the last two 
months of 1993. Police arrested a total of 26 suspects, 
including three from Hong Kong, and seized 17.4 kg of heroin and 
1.2 million yuan in cash. 
  Police in Zhaoqing ran an undercover operation on 2 November 
and arrested drug traffickers from Hong Kong, as well as a local 
drug- dealer. The police recovered 16.2 kg of heroin and 
620,000 yuan in cash. Later the same day, two accomplices were 
arrested in Shenzhen and two hideouts in Zhaoqing were smashed. 
  Further raids were carried out in Yunnan, Guangxi, and 
Luoding in Guangdong, capturing the ringleader. The drug ring 
was wiped out with the elimination of the drug route by which 
the drugs were first brought in from Yunnan and transported to 
Zhaoqing in Guangdong via Guangxi for later shipment to Hong 
Kong drug dealers. (Summary) (Beijing ZHONGGUO XINWEN SHE in

  A national network of over 3,000 courts protecting the 
rights 
of children under the age of 16 has been set up since the Law 
for the Protection of Minors was issued on 1 January 1992. The 
legislation seeks to abolish school dropouts, child labor, 
kidnapping, and corporal punishment. 
  Priority has been given to child kidnapping cases and the 
pornography trade. More than 8,000 infringements have been 
reported to the 24 provincial Communist Youth Leagues which have 
established child protection branches. Over 1,000 of these 
cases have been handled. 
  Li Lin, a six-year-old boy from Tianjin, sued his father and 
stepmother for beating him last August. The local child 
protection commission took up the case and three months later 
his parents were found guilty. His father was given two years 
in prison and his stepmother was sentenced to one year. 
  However, the law lacks specific rules on its implementation, 
according to Kang Suhua, professor of law at Beijing University. 
He says controversies are likely to occur. He states that some 
of the law's provisions are hard to implement in the absence of 
an established child legal system. He recommends the drafting 
of laws on handling juvenile cases and on juvenile courts as 
quickly as possible. (Summary) (Beijing CHINA DAILY in English

Guizhou 
  A major train robbery took place on 22 February on a 
Zhanjiang- bound train from Guiyang. Some of the suspects were 
immediately apprehended by the police. 
  The case involved 63 gang members who began to extort money

Hebei 
  A major bribery case involving 225,000 yuan was recently 
cracked in Xingtai, Hebei Province. More than 10 criminals were 
brought to justice. 
  From November 1990 to June 1992, Guo Qingmei, director of 
the 
power workshop of the Xingtai City Silk Plant, colluded with a 
self-employed transportation businessman from Xige Village, 
Shahe City, and issued forged invoices for a total of more than 
1,700 tonnes of coal, which amounted to 220,000 yuan. When the 
auditing department discovered that the amount of coal in stock 
did not match the amount recorded in the account book, it 
contacted the procuratorial organ at once. A thorough 
investigation of their crimes were carried out. 
  The criminals confessed that they bribed the plant director, 
the deputy plant director in charge of the purchase of coal, the 
director and the deputy director of the supply section, the 
director of the finance section, the person in charge of 
weighing coal, and the coal inspector to keep their mouths shut 
and to sign forms concerning the purchase of coal. Preliminary 
calculations show that the bribes totaled nearly 80,000 yuan. 
Some of those who accepted the bribes have surrendered 
themselves to the police. Others, being awed by the might of 
law, have voluntarily confessed their crimes. (Summary) (Beijing
