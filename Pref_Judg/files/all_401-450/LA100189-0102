The vast waters of the North Pacific cover an area the size of the continental 
United States, and a Coast Guard patrol plane could fly for hours without 
detecting one of the rogue fishing vessels said to be illegally catching salmon 
in international waters. 
</P>
<P>
But on the heels of an elaborate high-seas "sting" operation, which netted a 
ring of alleged fish rustlers in July, comes a new accord that will give the 
federal government greater power to control salmon poaching. 
</P>
<P>
Now for the first time, "fish cops" working for the National Oceanic and 
Atmospheric Administration may soon be keeping track of the exact location of 
hundreds of foreign vessels by using satellites to monitor their positions. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Satellite Transmitters 
</P>
<P>
After years of touchy negotiations, the U.S. State Department and Taiwan have 
reached an agreement requiring fishing boats in the North Pacific to carry 
satellite transmitters. The devices will be monitored by NOAA satellites so 
that special agents can turn on a computer in Washington and observe the 
locations of fishing boats, said Steve Springer of NOAA Fisheries Office of 
Enforcement. 
</P>
<P>
The accords deal with foreign vessels that use "drift nets." These fine-mesh 
nets can stretch 40 miles, about the distance between Washington and Baltimore. 
The nets are used by Taiwan, South Korea and Japan to catch squid at night, but 
they also trap anything else that swims into them. 
</P>
<P>
Because the nets are indiscriminate killers, and are capable of ensnaring not 
only squid, but salmon, seals, dolphins and sea birds, environmentalists have 
called them "curtains of death." 
</P>
<P>
"You put up a fine-mesh net between here and Baltimore and see how many birds 
you catch," said George Herrfurth of NOAA Fisheries Office of International 
Affairs. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
May Be Creeping North 
</P>
<P>
The drift-net fishing boats are supposed to stay below certain northern 
latitudes where salmon are commonly found. But in recent years, NOAA fisheries 
agents have suspected that many squid boats are creeping into the far North 
Pacific waters and using drift nets on salmon. 
</P>
<P>
The illegal salmon catches are then "laundered" through middlemen and sold to 
foreign or domestic buyers. 
</P>
<P>
The U.S. government considers all salmon that spawn in the rivers of the 
Pacific Northwest and Alaska to belong to U.S. fishermen, who net the fish on 
their return to the streams where they were born. 
</P>
<P>
U.S. fishermen and members of Congress have charged that poaching by foreign 
vessel is depleting salmon stocks, a $1-billion industry. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Fishing 'Sting' Operation 
</P>
<P>
The agreement with Taiwan comes days before a deadline stipulated by the Drift 
Net Act of 1987, and follows the "sting" operation aimed at Taiwanese fish 
brokers who were allegedly trying to sell illegally netted salmon to NOAA 
undercover agents in Seattle. 
</P>
<P>
The project culminated in a dramatic, high-seas chase that lasted several 
weeks, as two fleeing Taiwanese drift-net vessels allegedly in league with the 
fish dealers in Seattle were pursued across the Pacific Ocean by a Coast Guard 
cutter. 
</P>
<P>
As important as the use of satellites, the new agreements will allow federal 
agents to board and inspect foreign vessels in international waters. Boarding 
boats on the open seas is an intrusion zealously opposed by most captains. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Catch Must Be Recorded 
</P>
<P>
The accords also require that observers record what foreign fishermen pull up 
in their nets, so for the first time impartial counts can be made of what is 
hauled up from the deep. 
</P>
<P>
"The accord gives us an unprecedented amount of information on the drift-net 
fishery," said Larry Smead, director of the State Department Office of 
Fisheries Affairs, which conducted the talks along with NOAA and the Coast 
Guard.
