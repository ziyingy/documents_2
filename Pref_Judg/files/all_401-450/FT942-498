The Indonesian government has announced reductions in import duties on a
wide range of goods, but economists say the measures do not go far enough.
Import duties were cut on 739 goods, non-tariff barriers were lifted on 27
commodities, and import surcharges on 108 import items were also removed.
However, many non-tariff barriers remain, notably in the agricultural
sector. Deregulation of this sector is seen as a barometer of the
government's commitment to wider economic deregulation.
'This was less than people were expecting,' said a Jakarta-based economist.
Although the package removes import duties on politically sensitive
commodities such as wheat, sugar and soya beans, non-tariff barriers for
these products remain.
However, economists praised the government's efforts in reducing tariffs on
industrial imports, ranging from textiles to agricultural machines, which
are likely to make downstream operations more efficient and help boost
non-oil exports.
The Indonesian government said the trade deregulation package was 'designed
to anticipate the development of world trade post-Uruguay Round.' But there
was disappointment because the government did not unveil a trade
deregulation schedule. The government has been gradually reducing duties and
tariffs since 1986, but investors and economists were expecting a timetable
for future deregulation.
Investors were more enthusiastic about changes introduced to
export-processing zones. The package allows manufacturers to lend machinery
and equipment to assembly plants outside the bonded zones. In effect, this
lets manufacturers hire sub-contractors, a move prohibited under previous
regulations.
The trade deregulation package follows a sweeping deregulation of foreign
investment this month. The Indonesian government is trying to develop a more
diverse non-oil export sector as its oil exports have been declining.
