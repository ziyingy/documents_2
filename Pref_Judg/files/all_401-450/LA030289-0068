James Edward Fell is being honored for coming to the rescue of Eulalio

Fell, who witnessed the assault while driving by in his car, came to the aid of 
Castellanos and was stabbed after he struck the assailant, Rutkowski said. Fell 
and Castellanos were hospitalized for their injuries and later recovered, 
Rutkowski said.

Fell was notified about his award Friday in a letter from the Carnegie 
Commission, Rutkowski said. Fell and Castellanos were unavailable for comment 
Wednesday.

In addition to a medal and a certificate, each of the 19 award recipients will 
receive a check for $2,500, Rutkowski said.

The award was established by industrial magnet Andrew Carnegie in 1904 and is 
presented to recipients throughout the United States and Canada six times a 
year, Rutkowski said. Since the award's inception, about $17.7 million has been 
given to people who have aided others in life-threatening situations, he said.
