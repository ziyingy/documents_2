  [Text] Urumqi, December 28 (XINHUA) -- Northwest China's 
Xinjiang Uygur Autonomous Region has made unremitting efforts to 
provide the local wildlife with a better environment in recent 
years. 
  So far, the region has built 20, and plans another ten, 
nature reserves, eight of which are nature reserves of wild 
animals. 
  Covering an area of 1.6 million sq km, Xinjiang has 773 
species of vertebrate animals. Some of them are found in 
Xinjiang only; they include the Tarim hare and Tarim red deer. 
Some others such as wild horses, wild donkeys and wild camels 
are considered endangered species worldwide. 
  While firmly following state laws and regulations on the 
protection of wildlife, the region has promulgated a series of 
local regulations on protection of wildlife in its vast 
territory. 
  At the same time, the region's governments at all levels 
have 
paid attention to severely punishing people engaging in illegal 
activities such as poaching and trading in protected animals. 
  Besides government departments and personnel specializing in 
protection of wildlife, many mass organizations have been 
established in recent years to help protect wild animals. 
  As a result of these comprehensive measures, the living 
environment for wild animals in the region has been markedly 
improved and the number of wild animals has increased 
substantially. For example, the number of wild horses introduced 
from Germany, the United States and Britain has grown from 13 in 
1985 to 49.
