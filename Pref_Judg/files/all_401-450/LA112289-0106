Sony, the Japanese electronics maker that owns CBS Records and Columbia 
Pictures, defied analysts' expectations Tuesday and reported higher six-month 
results amid booming sales overseas. 
</P>
<P>
Net income for Sony and its consolidated subsidiaries totaled about $340 
million (49.06 billion yen), up from about $202 million (29.18 billion yen) a 
year earlier. 
</P>
<P>
Sales rose to $8.51 billion (1.229 trillion yen), up 23.8% from $6.88 billion 
(992.260 billion yen) in the comparable year-earlier period. 
</P>
<P>
Domestic sales continued to make up the largest part of Sony's overall sales in 
the six months. But despite booming personal spending in Japan, Sony marked up 
its strongest sales gains overseas, particularly in Europe. 
</P>
<P>
European sales jumped 30.3% from a year earlier while sales in the United 
States climbed 26.5%. Sales inside Japan increased a more moderate 16%. Sales 
of recordings by Sony's subsidiary CBS Records Inc. rose 18.8%.

"They are good numbers," said industry analyst Darrel Whitten at 
Prudential-Bache Securities (Japan). "Sony is strategically the best-placed 
company to maximize growth with the combination of hardware and software 
markets," he said. 
</P>
<P>
"The environment for consumer electronics is not like it was two years ago and 
despite that they have done well," said senior analyst Virginia Kouyoumdjian at 
Baring Securities (Japan). "The company is in the right areas. 
</P>
<P>
"It is the only company that has completely integrated operations that will be 
able to market entertainment software and hardware together." 
</P>
<P>
Sony is especially strong in compact discs and came out with the only 
innovative product in the audio area this year, the "Pixie," a high performing 
mini-stereo that can be stacked, lined up or put on a shelf. 
</P>
<P>
The maker of the Walkman personal stereo moved into the booming record business 
by purchasing CBS Records in 1988. "CBS has been bought and paid for and is 
contributing nicely to profits," said Prudential Bache's Whitten. 
</P>
<P>
Sony added a new piece of U.S. software, filmmaker Columbia Pictures 
Entertainment, early this month. 
</P>
<P>
"I think there is going to be an impact, perhaps in the fourth quarter and 
first quarter next year," Whitten said of the Columbia purchase. "There should 
not be much more than a six-month squeeze on earnings." 
</P>
<P>
Analysts said the company's long-term outlook is good. "In the long term, it is 
still the most exciting company in the world in consumer electronics. There's 
nothing like it," said Baring's Kouyoumdjian.
