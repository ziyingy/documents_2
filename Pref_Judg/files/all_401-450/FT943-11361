WMX Technologies, the international waste hauler based in Chicago, plans to
buy back all of the publicly-held shares of Chemical Waste Management, its
hazardous waste handling subsidiary, through an exchange of stock,
essentially merging the two companies.
The company said it was planning a review of its operations, hinting that it
may undergo a second restructuring in as many years.
WMX Technologies, formerly known as Waste Management, intends to issue 12.1m
shares, valued at nearly Dollars 353m, to regain full ownership of Chemical
Waste Management in a tax-free transaction.
Chemical Waste Management shares closed up Dollars  1/4 at Dollars 8 5/8
yesterday, while WMX Technologies were unchanged at Dollars 29 1/8 .
WMX already owns 78.6 per cent of Chemical Waste's outstanding shares and
intends to exchange 0.27 of its own shares for each one share of Chemical
Waste's common stock it does not own. Chemical Waste's public shareholders
need to approve the transaction.
