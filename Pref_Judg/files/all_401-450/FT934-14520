OZONE levels over the Antarctic have fallen to record lows in the past few
weeks and for the second year running the ozone hole has extended to
populated areas of South America, the World Meteorological Organisation said
yesterday. The latest data show no halt to the trend that has seen the
seasonal ozone hole steadily deepen and widen since its first appearance in
the late 1970s.
The United Nations agency said that, for three weeks in late September and
early October, the ozone hole encircled the entire continent, with more than
60 per cent of the ozone destroyed over an area greater than all of Europe.
For two days at the end of September, ozone levels over the southern tip of
South America were 40 per cent below pre-ozone hole averages and over the
Antarctic ozone measurements on several days were the lowest on record.
Loss of ozone in the upper atmosphere, which acts as a natural filter
against harmful ultraviolet rays from the sun, causes sunburn, skin cancer
and cataracts and threatens plant and marine life.
Under the Montreal Protocol industrialised countries will prohibit
production of chlorofluorocarbons and other ozone-eating chemicals from
1995, but their concentration in the atmosphere may not fall until early
next century.
The US and the European Community are expected to be among some 60 countries
ratifying the international treaty on biological diversity by the end of
this year, according to Mr Vicente Sanchez, chairman of the
intergovernmental committee negotiating details of its implementation. The
treaty, which has received 31 ratifications so far, is due to come into
force on December 29.
However, a week-long meeting of the committee in Geneva involving some 129
nations ended yesterday with little progress on such key issues as funding
arrangements, intellectual property rights and the sharing of benefits from
use of genetic resources.
