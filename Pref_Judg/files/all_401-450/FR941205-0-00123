In the July 1994 NOA, EPA described the new versions of EPA Methods 200.7, 200.8, 200.9, 245.1 (EPA, 1994a) and 504.1
(EPA, 1993d) that are approved in today's rule. Mercury and sodium have been added to the analytical scope of Methods
200.8 and 200.7, respectively. EPA is approving EPA Method 508.1 (EPA, 1994c), which allows liquid-solid extraction
(LSE) procedures to be used under Method 508 conditions for analysis of many analytes contained in EPA Methods 507
and 508. A minor revision to dioxin method 1613 that allows use of LSE is approved. Hexachlorocyclo-pentadiene has
been added to the analytical scope of EPA Method 508.

Trimethylsilyldiazomethane may be used as an alternative derivatizing reagent in Methods 515.1 and 515.2. EPA Methods
150.1, 150.2 and 515.1 are not withdrawn. Turbidity measurements of samples need not be made immediately before beginning
an analysis for metals; it is only necessary that the sample be acidified and held for sixteen hours. For EPA Method
531.1 (carbamates), samples no longer need to be frozen, thereby eliminating the possibility of frozen samples breaking
the sample vial. Standard Method 6610 is approved as an alternative to Method 531.1. Analysis for 2,3,7,8&hyph;TCDD
(dioxin) with Method 1613, or for asbestos with Method 100.1 or 100.2 can be simplified by using the guidance contained
in the EPA document, Technical Notes on Drinking Water Methods (EPA, 1994d).

 contains mandatory and optional procedures that will be cited in the drinking water regulations.

EPA is also correcting minor errors in the 1993 proposal. An erroneous listing of USGS methods I&hyph;2822&hyph;85
and I&hyph;2823&hyph;85 for sulfate, and ASTM D2036&hyph;91A for cyanide are removed in today's rule. The ASTM method
had been listed twice in the table of approved methods. A typographical error occurred in listing the USGS method for
silver and the ASTM method for chloride. The correct listings are USGS I&hyph;3720&hyph;85 (silver) and ASTM D4327&hyph;91
(chloride).

The effective date for all actions in this rule, except withdrawal of obsolete methods, is January 4, 1995. The withdrawal
date for obsolete methods is July 1, 1996 (or 18 months from publication, whichever is later), which is a year later
than proposed. After this date, EPA's manual ``Methods for Chemical Analysis of Water and Wastes'' (EPA, 1983a) will
contain only three approved drinking water methods_Methods 150.1, 150.2, and 245.2. To spare new laboratories the
expense of purchasing this manual, EPA will provide single copies of these methods to users who do not have a copy of
the 1983 manual. For the convenience of readers and for clarity of the rules, methods that are withdrawn will be specified
only by tabulating them in the document, Technical Notes on Drinking Water Methods (EPA, 1994d), and in the next revision
of the Manual for the Certification of Laboratories Analyzing Drinking Water (EPA, 1990b).

EPA received 136 comments on the December 15, 1993, proposal; 92 comments were related to chemical-analytical methods
and 79 comments were related to the methods associated with the coliform and surface water treatment rules. The Agency
received twenty comments on the July 14, 1994, Notice of Availability. The commenters included analytical laboratories,
water utilities, analytical instrument manufacturers, State and local regulators, and trade associations.

A summary of major comments and the Agency's response to the issues raised are presented in this section. The Agency's
detailed response to the comments received on the 1993 proposed rule and the 1994 NOA is available in the public docket
for this rule (EPA, 1994e).
