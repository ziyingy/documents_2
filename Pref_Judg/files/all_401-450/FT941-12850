Asea Brown Boveri, Europe's largest electrical engineering group, yesterday
announced one of the most significant joint ventures between a western and a
Russian company with a deal to make turbines and other power plant in St
Petersburg, Andrew Baxter writes from London.
ABB is teaming up with Nevsky Zavod, a big Russian manufacturer of gas and
steam turbines, to form ABB Nevsky, which will be 80 per cent owned by ABB
and 20 per cent by its Russian partner. ABB Nevsky will be producing
complete gas turbines based on ABB's latest advanced technology. These will
be used to modernise old power stations in Russia.
