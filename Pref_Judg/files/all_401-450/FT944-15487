Division, one of a small group of public companies specialising in virtual
reality technology, has taken its first step in the entertainment business.
It will announce today a Dollars 2.3m (Pounds 1.45m) order from Virtual
World Entertainment of Chicago, which is pioneering a form of entertainment
centre. The VWE order marks Division's first success in an area with great
potential for virtual reality companies.
VWE specialises in electronic entertainment for 18 to 35-year-olds. Its
centres follow the theme of a battle between robots or a race beneath the
surface of Mars.
The idea is to create an electronic equivalent of the setting where social
ambience is as important as the game, as with a bowling alley, for example.
Electronics supplied by Division will improve the realism.
Its principal market to date has been the engineering sector. Its largest
customer is Matsushita Electric of Japan, for which it built a system that
simulates a kitchen complete with white goods. It recently sold a system to
McDonnell Douglas which simulates the engine and engine bay of its F/A-18
fighter aircraft.
