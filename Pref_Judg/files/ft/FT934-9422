THE parallel agreements that form part of the proposed North American Free
Trade Agreement mark the first time a trade treaty requires member countries
to enforce their environmental and labour laws, and punishes them with fines
or sanctions if they do not.
The side agreements, which were proposed by Mr Bill Clinton when he was a
candidate for the US presidency, do not require countries to write new laws,
but simply to enforce those they have. They impose penalties on countries of
up to Dollars 20m - and if they are not paid, sanctions can be imposed -
that allow their companies to gain a competitive advantage by not complying
with existing environmental and labour regulations.
The agreements will formally apply to all three members of Nafta, (although
Canada will not be liable for sanctions) but were negotiated to persuade
wavering Democrats in the US Congress to support Nafta. They had opposed the
treaty partly on the grounds that Mexico would take jobs from the US by
exploiting its labour, and providing a haven for polluting factories.
While going further than any previous trade treaty, the accords fall short
of what most critics of Nafta wanted, and have failed to win over many
converts to the treaty.
Critics complain that under the accords the process of imposing fines on
member countries is long and cumbersome; that only governments, rather than
pressure groups, are empowered to initiate investigations into lack of
compliance; and that the powers of the labour commission are deficient.
Even supporters of the trade pact agree that the main intention of the side
accords is to promote co-operation, rather than compel through sanctions the
enforcement of all laws. None of the three countries, including the US, was
prepared to give up sovereignty that supra-national enforcement would have
required.
The accords create a tri-national Environmental and a tri-national Labour
Commission, both of which comprise a Council (made up of three ministers),
and a professional secretariat of staff members, which is partly protected
from interference from the national governments.
If a complaint has been made about non-enforcement of environment, the
environmental council has to vote by majority to convene an arbitration
panel of five independent members to decide if there has been a 'persistent
pattern of failure' to enforce the relevant regulations.
The arbitration panel has to issue a final report and make recommendations
within about eight months. If the panel's recommendations are ignored, the
panel can fine the offending nation, if the non-enforcement is
trade-related. If the fines are ignored for another six months, the
complaining country can impose sanctions on the country (in the case of
Mexico and the US) or take it to court (in the case of Canada).
The process is even more long-winded for violations of specified labour
rights. For, while the original intention was to have symmetrical labour and
environmental accords, the provisions on labour are weaker than those on
environment.
The failure to enforce all environmental laws is subject to fines and
sanctions, but with labour, penalties are limited only to failure to enforce
minimum wages, safety standards, and child labour laws. The North American
Labour Commission is limited to a staff of 15, whereas there is no limit on
the Environmental Comm-ission.
The environmental agree-ment allows all information to be used in findings,
whereas the labour agreement only allows publicly available information from
governments to be submitted.
The impact of the labour side accord could be significant, if Mexican
enforcement was stepped up as a result. While Mexico's minimum wage laws are
in effect enforced by the market place, child labour is widespread in Mexico
 -according to the estimate of the 1990 census there were 418,575 workers
between the ages of 12 and 14. Likewise, factories, especially small ones,
routinely ignore health and safety standards, and could probably not remain
in business if they had to comply with all the existing laws.
Nevertheless, US unions have complained that the labour side accord fails to
address violations of the right to strike and the right to choose
independently a union - such violations, they say, keeps Mexican wages down
to artificially low levels. Mexico's minimum wage is about Dollars 4.20 a
day, and the registered average wage Dollars 12.50 a day.
The Mexican government has wide powers to interpret labour law to its
advantage. The government is closely allied with the official Confederation
of Mexican Workers, headed by non-agenarian labour leader Fidel Velazquez,
and the two have worked together to make sure no break-away union acquires
too much power, and undoes the official wage and price policy.
Last year unions announced plans to strike 6,814 times, but only about 140
resulted in plant shutdowns. In a not unusual example, a strike at
Volkswagen car plant was declared illegal by the (government-controlled)
Federal Labour Board, even though a majority of workers had voted in favour
of the strike. A labour leader in the border city of Matamoros that has
urged workers to strike for higher wages, was arrested for not paying his
taxes, and the strike called off.
Ironically, Mexican labour laws go much further than US laws in defending
labour rights - guaranteeing the right to annual leave, profit sharing,
three months maternity leave, generous severance payments and in disallowing
factories from replacing striking workers. But the laws are so complex, that
full compliance is difficult.
By forcing Mexican companies to compete under free trade, Nafta may in fact
lead the Mexican government to reform the labour law, and strip some of the
legal protections offered to workers. Government officials and businessmen
argue that the labour law over-regulates the labour market, and is an
obstacle to productivity.
The environmental accord is tougher than the labour one, partly because
environ-mentalists were closely involved in drawing up the drafts to the
accord.
There was also a greater willingness on behalf of Mexico and Canada to make
concess-ions in the environment, a politically and economically less
sensitive area than the labour market.
The Mexican government has been stepping up its enforcement of environmental
laws lately, but independent reports suggest there is much to be done.
A study released last year by the US General Accounting Office found that
none of six in-bond plants that were questioned along the US-Mexican border
had complied with the necessary Environmental Impact Statement before
setting up their factories.
