ARGENTINA'S air force yesterday formally transferred control of its Condor
II missile project to a new civilian space agency, following US demands that
it stop developing the missile for military purposes, writes John Barham in
Buenos Aires.
Mr Rosendo Fraga, a military affairs specialist, said the move meant the
Condor was no longer a secret military project, and the technology would
fall under international safeguards.
The project was initiated in 1983 in collaboration with Egypt, and financed
indirectly by Iraq with support from German companies. Argentina developed a
propulsion system and in 1988 began work on a guidance mechanism.
In 1990 Argentine President Carlos Menem promised the US that the Condor
project would be cancelled. Washington repeatedly pressed him to destroy the
missile.
The air force is handing over control a week before Mr Dick Cheney, US
defence secretary, makes a two-day visit.
Western governments fear the dispersal of Argentine technology and
scientists could accelerate weapons proliferation. The US has made known its
concern over the planned sale by Argentina to Iran of Dollars 18m (Pounds
9.9m) worth of machine tools for work in the nuclear industry.
