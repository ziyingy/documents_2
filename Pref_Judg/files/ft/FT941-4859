Clyde Petroleum, the exploration and production company, has agreed to buy
Agip UK's 17.88 per cent interest in UKCS Block 16/27a (south) in the Andrew
Field for Pounds 12.7m.
The consideration will be funded from Clyde's own resources and includes a
reimbursement of Pounds 9m for Agip's past costs, which will qualify for tax
relief.
Clyde's Pounds 30m share of development costs will be funded by a fully
non-recourse financing underwritten by Chase Manhattan Bank.
