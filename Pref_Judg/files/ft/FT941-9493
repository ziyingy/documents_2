The Philippines could lose foreign investors to Vietnam if it does not
improve the investment climate by liberalising the economy, US business

Commerce, said part of the Philippine constitution which bans foreign land
ownership and limits foreign equity in mining companies to 40 per cent would
have to be amended.
