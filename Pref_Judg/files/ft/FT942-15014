The Gas Consumers' Council argued strongly yesterday for the retention of an
independent voice for customers after recent calls for a wholesale shake-up
of utility regulation.
The council is critical of the government's decision to cut its funding,
saying the need for a consumer's voice is at its greatest during the
transition from a monopoly to a competitive market.
In its annual report, published today, the council says that complaints it
received about British Gas dropped last year by 19 per cent to 20,428, but
protests about independent suppliers rose by 43 per cent to 745.
Rivals to British Gas can supply only a very small number of domestic users.
But when the rest of the market is opened up for competition in April 1996,
they will be able to compete for most household business.
The government's detailed proposals for liberalising the household gas
market have so far been delayed by six weeks. This is causing concern among
independent suppliers and consumer groups.
Mr Ian Powe, director of the council, said: 'Anxiety is growing about the
effect this will have on compressing the consultation period for everyone to
have their say.' He added that consumers should have more than a month to
make their views known on the new market.
The council has backed Ms Clare Spottiswoode, director-general of Ofgas, the
gas industry regulator, in her concern that consumers will pay higher gas
prices for funding energy efficiency projects.
