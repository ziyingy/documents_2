Coffee prices surged ahead yesterday after reports of a light frost in
Brazil, but although the market ended Dollars 59 a tonne higher, it failed
to hold on to earlier gains.
The November coffee futures contract at the London Commodity Exchange soared
to hit Dollars 3,675 a tonne in morning trading - a rise of Dollars 119 - on
news of the frost. But later confirmation that a light frost had touched
only a limited coffee-growing area pushed the market down to close at
Dollars 3,615 a tonne.
'The market's very sensitive, but prices would go higher if we hadn't
already had a lot of frost damage,' said one trader. Frosts in late June and
early July have already caused widespread damage to the Brazilian crop that
will be harvested next year pushing world market prices up by more than 50
per cent.
The Pocos de Caldas region in Minas Gerais, the main coffee-growing state,
was affected by yesterday's frost. Brazil's National Institute of
Meteorology has forecast more light frost in main coffee-growing regions for
this morning.
The prospects of further damage to the Brazilian crop are likely to keep the
market jittery for some days.
