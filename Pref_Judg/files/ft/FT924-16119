The ozone hole over Antarctica has expanded by 15 per cent this year and is
nearly the size of the entire North American continent, according to the US
National Aeronautics and Space Administration, Reuter reports from
Washington. It said this was the fifth year since 1986 to see large ozone
depletions.
