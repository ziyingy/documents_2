GOVERNMENT compensation for people infected with HIV, the virus that can
lead to Aids, during National Health Service blood transfusions and tissue
transfers, was announced yesterday by Mr William Waldegrave, health
secretary.
The package, which will cost about Pounds 12m, follows a Pounds 42m scheme
announced in November 1990 to help haemophiliacs who suffered in the same
way. There were reports late last year of HIV infection in 74 people who had
blood transfusions or tissue transfers.
The maximum payment, for infected people with dependent children, will be
Pounds 80,500.
Mr Waldegrave said that payments would be made as soon as possible, although
further work had to be done on the mechanism for handling individual claims.
Mr Benet Hytner QC is to chair a panel of experts to consider cases where
necessary.
Mr Waldegrave said the government did not accept the argument for a general
scheme of 'no fault' compensation for medical accidents, but ministers had
decided to treat patients infected with HIV as a special case.
The move follows an intensive parliamentary campaign on their behalf.
Labour welcomed the change in the government's position, although it
criticised the delay in reaching the decision.
Mr Neil Kinnock, the Labour leader, suggested the shift 'may well have more
to do with the approaching election than with the existing injustice to
people tragically and accidentally infected with HIV'.
Mrs Margaret Jay, director of the National Aids Trust, said: 'The
government's decision is welcome, but late. It could have saved long months
of unnecessary hardship by making this announcement earlier.'
