THE Japanese government yesterday received a report from a senior advisory
body urging the country to take a leading role in redefining rules on the
export of technology with potential military uses.
Once a target of criticism for inadequate export controls, Japan believes a
relatively good record more recently puts it in a strong position to lead
the debate on developing a new regime to prevent proliferation of
mass-destruction weapons.
The Security Export Control Committee report listed general recommendations
to the Ministry of International Trade and Industry, to be responsible for
drawing up specific lists of countries and products needing to be
controlled.
The committee raises concerns about export of items not under the control of
the Co-ordinating Committee for Multilateral Export Controls (Cocom) but
which may have military applications.
It questions the safety of the 'know' clause used by such countries as the
US, UK and Germany. If the exporter 'knows' technology may be used for
military purposes, official approval is needed. The report suggests tougher
controls are needed, 'based on clear and objective standards' not conditions
'such as whether the exporter knows how goods to be exported will be used'.
