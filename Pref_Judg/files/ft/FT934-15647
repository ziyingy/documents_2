THE government's nuclear safety watchdog has urged ministers to clear
obstacles in the way of creating the UK's first safe underground disposal
site for nuclear waste.
Delays in creating the disposal site at Sellafield in Cumbria mean that
nuclear waste is being stored in 'unsatisfactory' and 'deteriorating'
conditions at power stations and other nuclear installations, according to
the Advisory Committee on the Safety of Nuclear Installations.
Professor John Horlock, the committee's departing chairman, has asked Mr Tim
Eggar, the energy minister, to throw his weight behind efforts to establish
the nuclear waste store before 2010. In a letter leaked to Greenpeace, the
environmental group, Prof Horlock identifies 'unnecessary planning hurdles'
as a particular obstacle to progress.
The new store is due to be opened in 2007 by UK Nirex, the nuclear
industry's waste disposal company. But Prof Horlock casts doubt on whether
it can be opened before 2010 'or even within a few years of that date'.
His letter, sent in August, also calls for action to agree how nuclear waste
should be kept until the new store opens. It says the nuclear companies
which now store the waste are reluctant to take 'early steps to put the
waste into safer condition' in case it has to be repackaged before transfer
to the Sellafield site.
Prof Horlock warns that the delays in opening the site and agreeing on
repackaging the waste are 'producing a situation in which safety at nuclear
sites could be compromised . . .'
The Department of Trade and Industry said yesterday that the Health and
Safety Executive, the parent body of the advisory committee, had the power
to insist that nuclear waste is repackaged if necessary.
