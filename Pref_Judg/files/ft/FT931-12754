ARGENTINA'S LEADING commercial fishing company says the illex squid -
life-blood of the Falkland Islands economy - is under no threat from
overfishing. 'The illex is underexploited, not overexploited,' according to
Mr Mario Olaciregui, president of the Harengus fishing group.
Although he lacks scientific data to support his claim, Mr Olaciregui says
the first of his six squid boats began fishing on Thursday, just as the
season opened, and found the vessel was quickly overloaded.
'There is enough illex for everyone,' he insists. 'This is based on
empirical observation.' Harengus has fished for squid for years, catching
12,000 to 15,000 tonnes a year. It has found that squid availability varies
very little.
Mr Olaciregui adds that the illex market is limited to Japan, South Korea,
Spain and Italy, so demand is reasonably stable.
In December, Argentina announced that it would offer licences for foreign
ships to fish for illex squid in its waters - in direct competition with the
Falkand Islands, which in 1987 set up a highly lucrative licensing regime.
The islanders say the illex is a delicate resource, which if overfished
could be eliminated. Mr John Barton, Falklands director of fisheries, said
yesterday: 'Fishing pressure is already very high and we firmly believe that
a moderate increase in fishing effort will lead to a collapse of the stock.'
Last year, the Falkands reported licence revenues of Pounds 25m, some 80 per
cent of which came from illex licences. Mr Barton says that Argentina's
offer of cheaper licences has lured away most of the islands' Asian clients,
undermining its revenues.
