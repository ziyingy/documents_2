AN air-conditioning system which has no moving parts and could prevent the
spread of Legionnaire's disease has been installed in office buildings in
Cambridge.
The system replaces the boiler and cooling tower with a water tank
containing thousands of plastic balls (it is atomised droplets of
bacteria-ridden water escaping from the cooling tower that cause
Legionnaire's disease). Each of the balls is filled with salts which change
from a solid form to a liquid at 27 deg C. Such eutectic salts are already
used in the process industry where heat needs to be removed rapidly.
In hot weather the salts are frozen overnight using cheap-rate electricity.
During the day these frozen salts are used to cool the water circulating
through the tank. In winter the reverse occurs.
Although the designers of the system, The Company of Designers, in
Cambridge, say the system itself is more expensive than traditional heating
and cooling systems, it is less expensive to install in city centre
buildings because it takes up much less of the expensive floor space.
