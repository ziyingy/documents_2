Increasing volumes of information about small and medium-sized enterprises
(SMEs) in Europe are being produced by research institutes, universities,
government statistical offices and trade associations.
The European Commission has launched a project to bring together research
organisations throughout the community in what it calls a European
Observatory. The researchers will contribute to an annual report on the
state of SMEs in the community.
The project is led by the Research Institute for Small and Medium-Sized
Business (EIM) in the Netherlands and involves researchers from every
community member country.
