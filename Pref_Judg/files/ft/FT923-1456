THE UK government is delaying a multi-million pound seismic study of
territorially disputed waters in the south Atlantic because of commercial
objections to the way two companies were initially given access to the area,
write Jimmy Burns in London and John Barham in Buenos Aires.
In July Falkland Islands' officials announced they had chosen Spectrum of
the UK and Geco Prakla, a subsidiary of the New York-based energy services
group Schlumberger, to conduct more than Pounds 7m in high-technology
seismic work beginning next month.
However, the islands' administration, under instructions from the UK Foreign
Office, yesterday again invited applications for the licences in a move
expected to delay work in the area until at least early next year.
The Foreign Office said last night the move reflected the UK government's
concern that the tendering process should be fair and transparent. 'We want
the net to be thrown as wide as possible,' an official said.
It is believed the announcement earlier this summer drew protests from other
companies, including Ensign, a UK computer analysis group. The companies are
understood to be interested in applying for licences but were not fully
consulted by the Falkland Islands' government or the British Geological
Survey, the UK government-funded research organisation advising island
officials.
