EC interior ministers yesterday praised the efficiency of direct
co-operation between member states, delivering a veiled criticism of the
bureaucratic and legalistic processes of the European Commission and Court
of Justice.
Mr Kenneth Clarke, the British home secretary, said that in the light of the
Danish vote against the Maastricht treaty last week, he had been 'very
encouraged' by the atmosphere of the two-day meeting in Lisbon, which
discussed co-operation on immigration policy and crime-fighting.
'No one sought to impose solutions on an unwilling government, nobody placed
too much emphasis on bureaucracy, everybody concentrated on the principal
objectives which make this work so important,' he said after the meeting had
ended.
Mr Hirsch Ballin, the Dutch justice minister, said he thought there was 'a
common feeling among the 12 that we should intensify our co-operation' in
the area of immigration and judicial policy.
They form one of two 'pillars' of the Maastricht agreement - the other being
foreign and defence policy - in which the influence of the Commission and
Court of Justice would be limited or non-existent.
Some form of inter-governmental co-operation in these areas would almost
certainly survive, even if the Maastricht agreement collapsed. Mr Clarke
said: 'I believe this third pillar of Maastricht is going to be a success.'
During yesterday's meeting, ministers agreed that a German-led project team
should be set up in Strasbourg with a view to establishing 'Europol' - a
European police organisation - by the end of the year.
EC leaders will be asked to decide on the location of Europol's headquarters
at the Lisbon summit in two weeks' time.
The summit may also have to resolve the question of Gibraltar's treatment in
the long-awaited convention on strengthening the EC's external frontiers,
which is being held up by the UK-Spanish dispute over the colony.
