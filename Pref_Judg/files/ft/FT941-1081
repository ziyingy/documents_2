GIRLS: Short and sweet but no longer waiflike, there are womanly curves
under the naive fluted shapes. Good girls, bad girls, teddy girls.
DRESSES: The logical extension of summer's slip dresses, the autumn version
has a high waist, a short skirt and is in soft velvet or knit.
SHEEPSKIN: The acceptable face of fur to all but the purists - and more
aesthetically pleasing than manic day-glo shagpile, this season's choice
fake.
DRESSING GOWNS: The long wrap-and-tie coat hove into view last winter. Now
it comes richly adorned in velvet, brocade or quilting.
KIMONOS: Aiming to reverse recession-hit Japanese sales and mindful of China
as the next great market, designers are in love with Far Eastern shapes,
often used ingeniously.
SPORTSWEAR: From puffy ski jackets and minuscule skating skirts to runners'
go-faster stripes, this sports gear is for those whose fashion sense is
better-honed than their bodies.
HANKY POINTS: For those unwilling to commit themselves totally to short
skirts but unsure of the modishness of long, the ultimate bet-hedger. A nod
to the new length from the long-preferring avant-garde.
SOFT KNITS: The fuzzy outlines of angora, mohair or looped wool and cropped,
shrunken shapes take knitting to the opposite pole from the rugged
camouflage which the word 'sweater' often suggests.
