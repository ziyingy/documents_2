PARENTS want results. There is more to a good school than exam success, of
course. But parents rightly want to be sure that the schools to which they
send their children are capable of delivering the grades.
The FT-1,000 is the most comprehensive survey yet published of post-16
education and A-level achievement, the results that matter for entry to
higher education. The tables on the following pages give a mass of
information - not just raw exam results - on nearly 1,200 schools and
colleges across England and Wales from both the independent and the state
sectors.
At the very top, the message is stark. Judged by average results, private
schools sweep all before them. Of the top 200 schools, 177 are in the
independent sector. The top state school, The Judd School, Tonbridge, comes
63rd.
Private schools and exam success are far from synonymous, however. For the
FT-1,000 reveals the best of the state sector to be highly competitive with
many independent schools - even on the basis of average results, which,
given the highly selective entry policies of the leading private schools,
discriminate against the state sector, particularly comprehensive schools.
Take schools ranked between 250 and 350 - which gain average A-level results
per pupil of three grade Cs and send most of their leavers on to higher
education. Thirty-four are to be found in the state sector (19 grammar, 13
comprehensives and two sixth form colleges). Of the next 100, 46 are in the
state sector. Conversely, of the schools ranked in the last one hundred, 23
are private.
Nor do state schools charge parents Pounds 70,000 for three A-levels - the
going rate for 11 years at a mid-ranking prep and independent day school -
let alone the Pounds 140,000 needed to fund a decade in the boarding sector.
It is important to look beyond bald national figures to the position
locality by locality. Most parents, after all, are not looking for a school
somewhere between Truro and Newcastle: they want their children to be
educated fairly close to home. For that reason, the tables are arranged
county by county, to show the choices at a glance.
Unsurprisingly, grammar schools lead the state sector: 24 out of the top 30
state schools are grammar schools, while the top two comprehensives -
Hasmonean High in London and Wolverhampton Girls' High - are, respectively,
a religious foundation and a school which has opted out of local authority
control.
In Buckinghamshire, six of the county's grammar schools - led by Wycombe
Royal Grammar and Dr Challoner's High, Little Chalfont - outperform Stowe,
the famous public school, which charges day fees of Pounds 8,200 a year. In
all, the county has nine state schools performing above the FT-1,000 average
for all schools and colleges in the survey.
Lincolnshire and Kent are also notable for their large number of
high-performing state schools. Of Kent's top 20 schools, ten are in the
state sector, and the county's leading state schools are a match for all but
three of its independent schools.
Moreover, success is not just a function of formal academic selection.
Hertfordshire and Berkshire achieve the best average scores of the state
sector - indeed, they are the only two counties in which the state sector
exceeds the national average for all institutions in the survey. Yet they
have few grammar schools. Berkshire has nine comprehensives performing at or
above the average for the survey - including Windsor Boys, a bike ride away
from you-know-where.
The ranking in this survey is made on the basis of a computed FT score,
which gives approximately equal weight to the quality and grades in each
subject entry and the total quantity of grades achieved by each A-level
student. The score has been scaled so that a score of 1.00 represents the
average performance in 1992 of all schools and 6th form colleges in the
FT-1,000. The table opposite enables you to convert FT scores into average
A-level grades attained.
Comparing the sectors, the average FT score for independent schools is 1.14,
and for the state sector 0.89 (1.07 for grammar schools, 0.84 for
comprehensives and 0.89 for sixth form colleges). Westminster, at the top,
scores 1.77; the lowest score is 0.29.
The FT score is an important corrective to the rank ordering. This is
particularly true of schools and colleges in the middle of our listing. One
third of all institutions gain an FT score within ten per cent of the
national average, embracing those ranked between 353rd and 712th. The range
of scores attained by the top and the bottom hundred institutions is twice
as great.
The tables also include a 5-year FT score, based on results achieved between
1987 and 1991, to enable this year's score to be set in a broader context.
With the marked improvement in overall A-level performance this year, a
school's 5-year score ought to be somewhat lower than its 1992 score - about
0.03 down - for it to be treading water.
There is, however, an interesting discrepancy in the differential
performance of the two sectors: the state sector's overall 1992 score is up
only slightly on its 5-year score, whereas the independent sector's 1992
performance is 8 per cent higher. Almost certainly this reflects the success
of the state sector in increasing its staying-on rate.
Our last survey of the independent sector showed single-sex schools leading
the field. The FT-1,000 reveals a similar pattern among state grammar
schools, but a quite different picture among comprehensives. The average FT
score for state grammar schools is, respectively, 1.10 for boys schools,
1.07 for girls schools, and 1.02 for co-ed schools. For comprehensives, by
contrast, the respective figures are 0.83, 0.86 and 0.84. These disparities
will doubtless be a rich source of controversy.
Value for money is another theme emerging clearly from the FT-1,000. The
average annual per capita expenditure in state secondary schools is around
Pounds 2,500; the average day fees for private schools in our survey are
Pounds 4,943. In much of the state sector, the taxpayer evidently gets a
very good deal.
It is often alleged that there is little relationship between results and
spending per head in state schools. Our research shows that certainly to be
the case in the private sector. Four of the top ten day schools charge below
average fees, including Twycross House, a small school in Warwickshire,
where parents pay just Pounds 2,925 a year, a third less than the national
average. Collectively, private schools in Cheshire, Leicestershire,
Warwickshire and Greater London have the best A-level results in the
country, yet day fees are typically below average in all four counties.
In the state sector, education by mortgage appears largely to have replaced
education by ability. The relationship between school performance and house
prices is marked. The two top performing counties in the state sector -
Hertfordshire and Berkshire - have house prices respectively 45 and 51 per
cent above the national average.
Conversely, achievement does not go hand-in-hand with mortgages in the
private sector. Greater Manchester and Leicestershire combine top notch
results with house prices only a few hundred pounds above the national
average.
The FT-1,000 embraces most of the independent sector and more than 650 state
schools and colleges. The institutions listed are self-selected, but we are
confident they include most of the high-achievers across the country.
Independent tutorial colleges are also listed, but not included in the
ranking because a large proportion of their students were re-taking exams.
Further education and tertiary colleges - increasingly important providers
of post-16 courses - are also included in the listing but not ranked. Given
that many of their students combine A-levels with vocational courses, with
much of their intake studying only part-time, the FT score would
discriminate against them unfairly. Instead, they are given an FT score
based on quality alone (their score per entry), which is only loosely
comparable with the score for schools and sixth form colleges.
The FT survey of the independent sector published earlier this year included
A-level General Studies results. Many head teachers objected to this,
arguing that General Studies is comparatively easy, widely used as a 'top
up' A-level, and one often disregarded by university admissions tutors.
Persuaded by these arguments, we have omitted General Studies results from
the survey.
The tables indicate the proportion of pupils in each school / college
studying for A-levels in maths, science and modern foreign languages. The
overall proportions are broadly the same for both the state and independent
sectors. But the difference between boys and girls schools is marked. Taking
just the top 50 state schools, an average of 49 per cent of pupils in boys
schools study at least one maths or science course, compared with 39 per
cent in girls schools.
The tables also give stay-on rates post-16 - a useful corrective to raw
results, although stay-on rates are not a uniform guide to the selectivity
of the sixth form, particularly for institutions with highly selective
admissions policies at 11 or 13. Several independent schools in the top 100
had stay-on rates below 60 per cent, lower than many comprehensives with a
far wider academic mix.
A number of heads expressed concern that our stay-on rate does not include
pupils entering the sixth-form to take vocational courses, nor those leaving
to take A-levels elsewhere. Parents should note these points when
considering a particular school. They should also note that despite the
'type' given, some schools do not have a single identity. John Hampden
Grammar School, High Wycombe, for instance, has an open door sixth-form
admissions policy for pupils from local non-selective schools. The head
says: 'A high percentage are not going to gain the higher grades; they work
hard, and we - and they - are pleased with their Cs, Ds and Es.'
A-levels, it should be stressed, are not the only courses worth studying
post-16. Further Education and Tertiary Colleges have a long tradition of
teaching BTEC and other vocational courses, and some schools are joining in
too. The college sector will gain greater autonomy next spring, when local
authority administration is ended and each college becomes a self-governing
trust financed from fees, a state funding council, and its own
entrepreneurial activities. Doubtless many will seize the chance to market
themselves aggressively.
Tutorial colleges, a much neglected aspect of post-16 provision, cater
largely, though not exclusively, for re-takes. They teach in small groups
and their fees are high. But their results are generally impressive, and
most stress that their doors are open to first-timers, not just those who
did not make the grades first time.
Roy Chapman, Headmaster of Malvern College, recently lamented the discovery
of 'a pernicious viral disease which is the product of the late-20th
century: league table fatigue.'
The FT-1,000 is more than a league table. But even if it were not, there is
no evidence of widespread fatigue among consumers. On the contrary, parents
remain anxious to find schools which deliver the goods. Parents and pupils
need to weigh all information at hand with care - just as do readers of the
FT's companies and financial indicators. The possibility of
misinterpretation is no justification for suppression. If it were, viral
infections of a more deadly kind would take hold.

HOW TO READ THE TABLES
FT score: A-level grades were awarded UCCA points on the scale A=10, B=8,
C=6, D=4, E=2; AS-levels were counted as half an A-level (ie. A=5 UCCA
points). The FT score is a weighting of the average UCCA points per entry
(the quality of grades attained) and the average UCCA points per candidate
(the quantity of grades attained), with 1.0 the average score achieved
across the FT-1,000.
An FT score of more than 1.0 denotes above average A-level results, less
than 1.0, below average.
Further Education, Tertiary and Tutorial Colleges have been given scores on
the basis of average UCCA points per entry only. Since this is not directly
comparable, they have not been ranked.
5 year score: 1987-1991 A-level results compared with the average results
for 1992.
