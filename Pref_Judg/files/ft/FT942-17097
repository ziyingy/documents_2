The decision by the UDF, one of parties in France's ruling coalition, to
choose a strongly pro-European candidate to lead the government list for
this June's European parliament elections has created problems within the
coalition. The Gaullist RPR party had favoured a less pro-European
candidate. While the RPR is likely to endorse the nomination of Toulouse
mayor Dominique Baudis, the choice might drive some Gaullist voters towards
a dissident conservative list.
