Prosecuting agencies must be given increased access to highly sensitive
documents held by other government departments, Mr Sandy Russell, deputy
chairman of Customs &amp; Excise, warned yesterday.
Giving evidence to the Scott inquiry into sales of defence equipment to
Iraq, Mr Russell said the Matrix Churchill trial had been a catalyst for
improving the ability of investigators to see such material. However, he
warned that the nature of the 'government machine' meant further efforts to
improve access were still urgently required.
Mr Russell said retrieving documents for the Matrix Churchill trial from
different government departments had proved immensely difficult. Even
investigators with security clearance to read sensitive documents found the
rules on access very tight. He agreed with Lord Justice Scott that Customs
needed good access to sensitive papers to prevent breaches of the law and to
enable both prosecutors and defendants to present their cases properly.
Earlier, Mr Russell told the inquiry how Customs had been reluctant to
abandon its prosecutions of two businessmen over the 'supergun' affair, when
UK engineering firms made parts of a large gun destined for Iraq.
Although lawyers had advised that the prosecution would probably be rejected
by a jury, Customs officials sought further clarification from Sir Patrick
Mayhew, then attorney-general. Customs felt that failure to prosecute would
be a heavy blow to effective enforcement of export regulations while the
'supergun' affair had also caused considerable public concern.
The prosecution was abandoned only after Sir Patrick told Customs its
evidence was clearly inadequate, he said.
