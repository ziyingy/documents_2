The Roaring Forties and the Storming Fifties. Not exactly paradise for the
sailor of a small boat. The seas around 55 degrees south, off Cape Horn, are
some of the worst in the world. The swell rolls west to east almost
unchecked. It is hurricane-torn, even in summer.
This month, four British yachtsmen plan to retrace one of the most arduous
survival stories in maritime history: the voyage of Sir Ernest Shackleton
and five others from the northernmost point of Antarctica across perilous
seas to South Georgia, to fetch help for 22 colleagues marooned on barren
Elephant Island - an attempt that succeeded and all survived.
The re-created voyage, in a specially designed 23ft replica boat named the
Sir Ernest Shackleton, will benefit from the long days of the Antarctic
summer. But it will not be plain sailing.
'If we miss the island,' says the group's leader, Trevor Potts, a
43-year-old water sports development officer from Tyneside, 'there's no
turning back: it's South Africa here we come]'
But why should anyone want to retrace Shackleton's boat journey at all?
'It's been at the back of my mind for years,' Potts explains. 'After all, it
was one of the greatest survival stories ever. To bring anyone back alive,
let alone the entire party, against all the odds, was an amazing feat.
Shackleton was an unusual leader.
'He undoubtedly made mistakes; yet he was the brains, behind not just both
expeditions (six years earlier, Shackleton and three others came within 97
miles of the Pole), but the rescue as well.'
Shackleton's ship, Endurance, sailed south in August 1914, just as war broke
out. His plan involved a crossing of the continent, from the Weddell Sea to
the Ross Sea via the South Pole. But in January 1915, Endurance became
trapped in the pack ice. She was borne 1,000 miles northwards before
sinking, crushed by enormous pressures. For four months the party camped on
floes, then fled in lifeboats as the ice broke under them.
That they reached Elephant Island, in appalling conditions, was a miracle.
The James Caird, largest of the three lifeboats, in which Shackleton made
his dash for help, was 23ft long and 6ft in the beam. On the ice two strakes
had been added, giving her a freeboard of 2ft 2in. Before the journey she
was decked with packing case lids and covered with canvas, stretched over
sledge runners. A spare mast had been bolted to the keel to stiffen her.
Rocks and bags of gravel and rocks served as ballast.
The group's only reachable source of help, South Georgia, was a mere speck
in the ocean, 800 miles distant. Had it not been for a superb navigator,
Frank Worsley, the Endurance's New Zealand-born skipper, James Caird might
never have reached her destination.
What followed was an epic battle - against continuous, freezing gales and
mountainous seas, drenched clothes, salt water sores, ice and frostbite -
plus on day nine, at midnight: 'The huge crest of an enormous 90ft wave, the
most gigantic I had ever seen,' wrote Shackleton. 'It was a mighty upheaval
of the ocean: we baled non-stop, like men fighting for dear life.' Their
sleeping bags shredded; salt leaked into their fresh water. Worsley had few
glimpses of the sun to check their position; his navigational tables were
soaked and almost illegible.
What saved them in the end was a mixture of luck, tenacity and hot food:
concentrated 'hoosh', and scalding milk at four-hour intervals, boiled on a
rickety primus.
When they sighted South Georgia 15 days later, they were faced by an
iron-bound coast - a lee shore in a hurricane. They were nearly dashed to
pieces. Disaster threatened when they almost lost their mast. It was 36
hours before they made a safe landing, tacking precariously into a cove in
King Haakon Sound. A 500-ton steamer from Buenos Aires, they later learned,
was lost that night with all hands.
Potts is no stranger to adventure. His log of a single-handed voyage to
Falmouth from the Azores, when his 25ft boat was almost overwhelmed, won the
Dugon Prize in 1986. Soon after, he and another party member, Robert
Egelstaff, made a journey by kayak, in near-zero temperatures, across the
Bering Strait from Alaska.
On that trip, the party got separated by fog, missed an island and ended up
being arrested by Russian coastguards. When we met in Newcastle-upon-Tyne,
in Tyne and Wear, he had problems locating a nearby pub and mislaid the only
female member of the party - Victoria Brown, a qualified yachtmaster and
navigation specialist. 'Don't worry,' Potts reassured me. 'Vicky will be
navigating, not me.' The Sir Ernest Shackleton has been built to his designs
by McNulty's, the South Shields shipbuilder, where he was a workshop
manager.
Is it really a replica? 'We kept her dimensions as near as we could to the
James Caird,' says Potts. She has a similar sailing ability. But we've made
her stronger and more watertight. We've added four bulkheads. Our hull,
strip-planked, is glass fibre- and epoxy-sheathed, and laid on laminated
frames; and has been strengthened with steel so she won't buckle. Our
cockpit is smaller but, like the James Caird, she's not high enough in the
water to self-drain. So we expect to do a fair bit of pumping and baling.'
The new boat is ballasted not just with lead, but with water beneath the
cabin bunks. Perhaps most important, she has a tiller. With his 'accursed
mizzen' - as Worsley termed it - forming an obstruction, Shackleton was
forced to steer with yoke and lines.
There is no room for a life-raft, but an Inmarsat satellite transceiver,
backed up by VHF and GPS (global positioning system), should keep Potts's
team on course and in touch. 'Still, we plan to navigate by traditional
means part of the time,' explains Vicky Brown, 'to get some idea of the
problems Worsley faced.' If their GPS breaks down (as it might), they will
have no choice.
Their main advantages over Shackleton will be temperature and daylight. 'But
winter conditions are actually more settled,' Trevor Potts points out. 'In
the Antarctic summer there's a good chance of strong crosswinds and high
swells - a north-easterly right up our nose. If we get a hurricane, things
could definitely be as bad. But Shackleton had huge problems with ice; we
don't anticipate that.'
No photographic record exists of the boat journey or the other epic that
followed, and which the group also plans to retrace: a treacherous climb by
Shackleton, Worsley and Irishman Tom Crean over the glaciers, snowbound
ridges and bleak mountains of the uncharted interior of South Georgia to
reach the Norwegian whaling stations on the other side.
The skills of the fourth expedition member, Chris Smith, a mountainering
expert from North Wales, could well be needed.
With a scrap of German chart and a pair of compasses, Shackleton's trio
covered 40 miles (22 as the crow flies) in 36 hours, scarcely pausing to
rest. Trapped on a ridge, they glissaded 1,000ft into the unknown, hunched
together on a coiled rope, and landed in snow, descending next day via a
waterfall to Stromness. Their luck never waned. The moonlit conditions were
the best in weeks. Next day, the blizzards closed in.
Will Potts and his companions manage? 'My experience is that when the going
gets hard you become stronger, not weaker,' says the leader, who suffers
from rheumatism and arthritis (Shackleton himself went through agonies due
to because of sciatica). 'None of us is a giver-up,' puts in Vicky Brown.
'Shackleton hated it when things eased off,' Potts adds.
The James Caird (named after Shackleton's main sponsor, a Scottish
industrialist) survived both the journey home and a second world war flying
bomb. Restored by the National Maritime Museum, it is displayed at Dulwich
College, to which it was presented after the explorer's death on his last
Antarctic expedition - a planned circumnavigation - in 1922.
The building of the Sir Ernest Shackleton has been sponsored by the Gryphon
group of companies: Aran Energy, Clyde Petroleum, Kerr McGee and Santa Fe,
with additional help towards equipment and clothing. Further sponsorship is
welcome.
