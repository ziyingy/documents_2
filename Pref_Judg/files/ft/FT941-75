The benefits of streamlining the management structure and the dollar
exchange rate helped Ocean Group, the freight, environmental and marine
services combine, to achieve pre-tax profits of Pounds 44.1m for 1993.
This was sharply ahead of the previous year's Pounds 16m, struck after a
Pounds 16m loss on the Panocean disposal and a charge of Pounds 8.4m for the
management restructuring.
The latest figure represents a 9 per cent rise on 1992's underlying profits
of Pounds 40.4m. Group turnover rose from Pounds 875m to Pounds 964m,
including Pounds 10.7m from discontinued operations.
Mr Nicholas Barber, chief executive, said the management changes had
contributed about Pounds 5m to profits, and movements in the exchange rate a
further Pounds 4m.
He described the markets for most of the group's services as tough. 'In
these conditions the growth in our results was encouraging,' he said.
Operating profits from the freight and distribution division, which operates
on fine margins, eased from Pounds 15.1m to Pounds 14.7m on turnover ahead
from Pounds 644m to Pounds 748m. The profits fall was mainly due to Hull
Blyth, which was seriously affected by the war in Angola.
Profits at MSAS, the air freight brokerage company, were 15 per cent ahead
on exchange gains and the benefits of a new computer system. Large new
clients included Eastman Kodak.
The marine services division, which contributes the bulk of profits, also
benefited from exchange rates which countered lower oil prices. They rose by
25 per cent from Pounds 24.1m to Pounds 30.1m on turnover of Pounds 132m
(Pounds 122m).
The group succeeded in moving its oil exploration vessels away from the
depressed North Sea to areas of strength in west Africa and south-east Asia.
Profits from environmental services rose from Pounds 4m to Pounds 4.4m on
turnover of Pounds 70.5m (Pounds 65.6m). The UK domestic waste business had
a good year.
Earnings per share were up to 20.3p (1.4p). An unchanged final dividend of
9.62p is proposed giving an unchanged total for the year of 14.33p.
COMMENT
Ocean has been running hard to stand still. The benefits from the
restructuring and exchange rate movements have saved it from a flat year or
worse. Most of the profits come from the marine services area, where low
prices are curbing oil exploration budgets. Overall there appears to be
nothing to get excited about from the rather mixed bag of activities.
However, there is a further Pounds 3m benefit to come from the
restructuring, and the balance sheet is strong, with gearing down from 35
per cent to 17 per cent. A yield of 6.6 per cent makes the shares worth
holding.
