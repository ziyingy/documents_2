Mining companies increasingly are switching their worldwide exploration
efforts towards Latin America. But the US still takes the biggest share of
exploration spending by the major companies, according to the Canadian
consultants, Metals Economics Group.
Budgets of the 137 companies reviewed total USDollars 1.7bn. Of this,
Dollars 345m is directed to the US. Australia gets Dollars 333m, Latin
America Dollars 331m, Canada Dollars 295m and the Pacific area Dollars 124m.
MEG points out that Canada has dropped from first place in terms of
exploration activity in 1989 to fourth this year.
Latin American countries receiving the most exploration attention this year
are Chile, with about 40 per cent of the total for the region; Mexico, about
20 per cent; and Brazil, about 19 per cent.
The percentage of expenditure directed to gold targets has been falling
steadily in recent years, according to MEG, while base metals-related
spending has been rising after a very low level of activity in the
mid-1980s. In this case the consultants reviewed the exploration spending
plans of 139 companies, totalling USDollars 1.9bn, and found Dollars 925m
(48.7 per cent of the total) being spent on gold this year compared with
Dollars 839m or 52 per cent in 1992 and Dollars 1bn or 56 per cent in 1991.
Base metals exploration expenditure this year is Dollars 669m or 35 per cent
of the total, compared with 32 per cent of the reported spend in 1992.
More than half the spending directed at other mining targets is for diamond
exploration. Some 29 big companies are involved in the search for diamonds,
but the Dollars 111.7m budgetted for diamond exploration and research by De
Beers of South Africa remains unchallenged.
RTZ Corporation of the UK, the world's biggest mining company, is also the
biggest spender on exploration, MEG suggests. Including the budget for CRA,
its 49 per cent-owned Australian associate, RTZ is spending Dollars 200m
this year compared with De Beers Dollars 111.7m. The third largest corporate
exploration budget, Dollars 71.8m, is attributed to BHP Minerals, part of
the Australian resources group.
