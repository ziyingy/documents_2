John Birt, the new director-general of the BBC, was remarkably frank
yesterday when he spelt out details of his reorganisation plans at the
Corporation. A Programme Strategy Review across all the directorates of the
BBC would get under way immediately.
'The review will be this year's major task; it should be creatively
stimulating and highly enjoyable. Exactly what we all joined the BBC to do,'
he said. Hope the programmes will be enjoyable too.
