ABB Robotics, part of Asea Brown Boveri, has won a 'breakthrough' order
worth nearly Dollars 20m to supply more than 200 industrial robots to
General Motors Europe.
The deal is ABB Robotics' first European order from GM, which has previously
bought most of its robots from its former joint venture company, GMFanuc
Robotics.
Last year, however, GM sold its 50 per cent stake in GMFanuc to its partner,
Fanuc of Japan, as part of its strategy to concentrate on its core business
of vehicle production.
The robots are part of substantial investments by GM at its plants in
Belgium, Germany, Sweden and the UK. At least 120 of the robots ABB is
supplying will go to the Vauxhall Motors plant in Luton.
Most of the robots will be delivered next year, and will be mainly used for
spot welding. ABB Robotics said the performance and cost efficiency of its
product line were key factors in winning the order against fierce Japanese
competition.
ABB Robotics' and the renamed Fanuc Robotics are the two biggest suppliers
of robots to European industry. Over the past decade, the automotive
industry has been the largest customer for industrial robots. It remains
important to the robot industry even if growth opportunities are higher in
less robotised industrial sectors such as the food industry.
