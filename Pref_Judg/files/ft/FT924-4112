BANKAMERICA Corporation has established a Dollars 2bn Euro medium-term note
programme to give it greater flexibility in tapping markets in local
currencies other than US dollars.
The new programme is part of a rearrangement of its existing global MTN
arrangements for the issue of paper in the domestic US market and the
Euromarkets.
Merrill Lynch International, the arranger, said BankAmerica would now find
it easier to issue paper in a number of currencies than under the old
documentation which had not always kept pace with developments in the
Euromarkets since it was established in October 1988. The main currencies
newly available are the D-Mark and the Japanese yen.
'The dealers will now hope to be able to show Bank of America funding
opportunities in virtually ever major currency,' said Mr Kevin Regan, a
managing director at Merrill Lynch International.
Notes will be issued with maturities of one month or longer, but will
typically be in the three to five-year range. Following the growing trend,
the programme will also allow for the issue of Eurobonds.
