Japanese industrial output fell for the second year running in 1993, the
longest decline since the aftermath of the 1973 oil crisis.
Production fell 4.5 per cent last year, an apparently encouraging slowdown
on the 6.1 per cent decrease in 1992, according to the ministry of
international trade and industry.
However, stocks of unsold inventories continued to climb by 2.2 per cent,
with a recovery of demand nowhere in sight, a Miti official said.
Output rose in the first quarter of last year, fuelling recovery hopes, but
then went into an accelerating decline, with the final three-month period
down 3.7 per cent compared with the same period the previous year.
Separately, sales at supermarket chains fell 1.1 per cent last month from
January 1993, marking the 17th month of decline since September 1992. While
the overall sales value fell, the volume of goods sold rose last month as
consumers hunted for the cheapest brands, according to the Japan Chain
Stores Association said.
A glimmer of encouragement for the Japanese economy emerged yesterday in the
form of a 23.8 per cent rise in steel exports last year.
The rise, to a four-year record of 23.5m tonnes, was mainly due to demand
early in the year from China, the Japan Iron and Steel Federation said.
Property prices in the Tokyo area are showing signs of recovery, according
to a survey by a private research firm, Reuter adds from Tokyo.
Of 621 estate agents surveyed on February 14, 9.0 per cent said land prices
in the Tokyo area had risen from January, 55.5 per cent said they were
little changed and the remainder said prices were declining.
The number of respondents who said land prices were falling dropped for the
second consecutive month.
