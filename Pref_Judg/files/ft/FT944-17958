Finland's board of navigation said yesterday that the bow doors of all
roll-on, roll-off ferries sailing in 'open' Baltic seas had to be welded
shut as a safety precaution while investigations into the sinking of the
Estonia continued. Swedish authorities say they will insist on similar
measures, writes Christopher Brown-Humes in Stockholm.
Silja Line, the Baltic's leading ferry operator, said it would seal the bow
doors of five ferries - vessels which either sail in open seas or have the
same visor-type bow construction as the Estonia.
Three other Baltic ferry operators have promised similar measures.
Accident investigators want to locate the Estonia's bow door, after video
footage established on Monday that it had been torn off in heavy seas. Mr
Andi Meister, Estonian chairman of the commission, said: 'We now know how it
happened when water gushed into the ship, but we still do not know what
caused the catastrophe.'
Lines of inquiry include technical failure, metal fatigue, overloading and
negligence.
Meanwhile, the Stena Saga was withdrawn from service between Fredrikshavn in
Denmark and Oslo yesterday after Swedish inspectors discovered cracks in the
vessel's bow shield.
Estline, the operator of the Estonia, suffered another misfortune on Monday
evening when a chartered cargo ferry, the Cap Canaille, ran aground in the
Stockholm archipelago en route to the Estonian capital of Tallinn.
After freeing herself, she returned to Stockholm where a leak in a tank was
discovered.
She is expected to be out of service for several days.
