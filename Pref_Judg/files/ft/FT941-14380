Argentina's agriculture department has sacked top officials at the Senasa
animal health service for incompetence in allowing an outbreak of
foot-and-mouth disease in Patagonia, a region that had been declared free of
the disease.
The department promises it will be 'absolutely inflexible' to halt the
region's worst outbreak of foot and mouth in 20 years. Senasa has already
ordered the killing of 9,000 cattle and sheep since the disease was first
notified at the end of December.
Senasa specialists say that they have disinfected and quarantined 50 small
farms in a 20km radius around the tourist city of Bariloche and ordered the
vaccination of 60,000 animals.
However, a Senasa official claimed the problem was like a 'drop in a huge
lake. There are 13m animals in this region and they are healthy'.
Among the properties worst affected was Mr Lucio Benetton's Pilcaneu farm,
where the government ordered the slaughter of almost 10 per cent of its
27,000 sheep.
Senasa believes the outbreak started at a small farm near Bariloche, where
pigs may have been infected by illegal feeds. An official said the disease
spread rapidly because 'there has been a tremendous growth in tourism and a
big increase in cattle movements to meet demand'.
However, the Agriculture department suspects that lax controls at Senasa
allowed the foot-and-mouth virus to travel south from the country's infected
northern region.
The government has spent about Dollars 400m since 1989 on a campaign to rid
Argentina of the disease.
