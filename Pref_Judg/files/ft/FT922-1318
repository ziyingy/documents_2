THE NUMBER of cases claiming equal pay for equal value being brought to
industrial tribunals more than trebled last year compared with 1990,
according to an analysis by Industrial Relations Services, the independent
pay and conditions group.
Much of the increase was accounted for by about 600 cases brought by
domestic staff against four Northern Ireland health boards, claiming equal
pay with porters. Overall, almost 90 per cent of the applications involved
just six employers.
The study found that the average wait for cases to be determined by
tribunals is just less than 17 months, although cases can take much longer.
Two cases settled last year, both without the need for a tribunal ruling,
took almost four years and six years to resolve.
Long waits reflect the complexity of the legislation. The Equal
Opportunities Commission has argued that existing equal pay and sex
discrimination legislation should be replaced by a single, more simple act.
The principle of equal pay for equal value means that an individual can
claim equal pay with someone of the opposite sex, even if they are in a
different post in the organisation, if it can be argued that the work makes
equal demands.
There were 1,313 applications on those grounds last year - the most since
1987, the study found.
