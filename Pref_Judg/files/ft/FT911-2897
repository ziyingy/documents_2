TALKS on an international agreement to protect the Antarctic from
exploitation by mining companies appeared to be heading for failure
yesterday.
Mr Curtis Bohlen, head of the US delegation and assistant secretary of state
for economic and international environmental affairs, said that after a week
of talks in Madrid supporters of a 40-year mining moratorium and others who
want an eternal ban were at loggerheads.
The US, backed by the UK, supports the 40-year moratorium, but is becoming
isolated by the increasingly popularity of the Australian position, which
favours an eternal ban.
Mr Bohlen said he had seen 'no indication that they (the Australians) were
willing to move away from the concept of a permanent ban'. There was 'no
chance' that the conference, which ends on Tuesday, would reach consensus on
Article Six of the Antarctic Treaty, which governs mining on the continent,
he said.
Nevertheless, supporters of a total ban say their position has been improved
by a change of heart this week by the Japanese, who came out in support of a
permanent ban. Many delegates said it was likely that if the meeting failed
to reach a consensus on mining, the issue would be discussed again in Bonn
in October.
The Madrid meeting is, in effect, a continuation of a special consultative
conference held in Chile last year.
Further talks are likely at the weekend in the faint hope of reaching
agreement.
