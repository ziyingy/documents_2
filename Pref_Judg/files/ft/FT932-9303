Visually impaired television viewers could soon be given 'voiceover'
commentaries during breaks in the dialogue to help them follow events on the
screen.
The Independent Television Commission of Winchester, has contracted Portset
Systems to develop a way of compressing and coding this commentary into a
digital signal to be broadcast alongside the programme. The signal is
decoded into speech by a box which sits on the TV set. The Audetel (audio
description of television) equipment should be ready in about a year. ITC:
