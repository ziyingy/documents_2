Lord Justice Scott may call more witnesses to give evidence to the inquiry
into the exporting of defence-related equipment to Iraq, officials indicated
yesterday.
The scheduled public hearings, which have lasted just over a year, ended
yesterday when officials from Customs and Excise completed giving evidence.
Their presence had already caused the inquiry to extend its original April 1
deadline.
Even if more witnesses are called, Lord Justice Scott is expected to keep to
his original timetable and complete his draft report by July, with the final
report due to be published by December.
Provisional criticisms will be sent in August to those concerned.
