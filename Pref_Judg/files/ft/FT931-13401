Just as the collapse last August in De Beers' share price was an important
factor in driving down the Johannesburg Stock Exchange, so its recent
recovery has helped get the market off to a buoyant start in 1993.
The overall index has risen by about 4 per cent in the first three weeks,
having closed 1992 down 5.3 per cent on the year. The index closed yesterday
up 22 at 3,404.
Much of this year's rise can be attributed to De Beers, which accounts for
some 10 per cent of total volume and 5 per cent of market capitalisation.
The shares have risen by 16 per cent since the start of the year, closing
yesterday at R68.25, after finishing 1992 at R57.50. This improvement is
mainly attributable to better than expected rough diamond sales by the
Central Selling Organisation during 1992, and indications that the problem
of excess supply from Angola and Russia has eased.
The industrial index has also started the year strongly, up 4 per cent,
after a 4.6 per cent gain in the whole of 1992, which followed a strong 39
per cent rise the previous year.
Mr Richard Jesse, an analyst at brokers Martin &amp; Co partly attributes this
good start to the, by now, 'tedious litany' of the market's scrip shortage.
Nevertheless, most observers believe that 1993 will be a better year on the
JSE than 1992. To some extent, this view is supported by improved political
and economic fundamentals. While the speed of political negotiation is
rather slow all those involved are aware that the country cannot afford a
repeat of the damaging political hiatus which followed the failure of the
Codesa 2 talks in May and the Boipatong massacre in June.
Economic expectations, however, are muted: the weather pattern in recent
weeks has led to renewed fears that the El Nino phenomenon, associated with
the severe drought of 1991-92, has reappeared. Last year, for instance, the
drought shaved nearly 2 percentage points off GDP growth.
The expectation remains, however, of positive growth in 1993 of around 1.5
per cent (GDP shrunk by about 2 per cent in 1992), on hopes of a better
agricultural season and improved commodity exports as world growth improves.
The earnings prospects of industrial companies remains gloomy. Most
companies that have reported recently have predicted a drop in profits and
there is little expectation of improved corporate profits before 1994.
In spite of these rather pale fundamentals, Mr Jesse is predicting a
rerating of the market. He believes that the Financial and Industrial index,
currently on a price/earnings ratio of 14.9 times, down from a peak of some
15.5 in 1992, could rise to more than 16 this year.
He gives two main reasons for this forecast, apart from the improved
political prospects. First, the absence of alternatives: property returns
are expected to fall in 1993, while money market rates which are in line
with inflation, and likely to fall with interest rates, are hardly
attractive.
Capital markets are also a difficult route because, while the probable
short-term decline in inflation, which currently stands at about 11 per
cent, is positive, this is counterbalanced by concerns about the size of the
government's budget deficit and prospects of a relaxation in fiscal policy
under an interim government.
Second, Mr Jesse argues that South African fund managers will be increasing
the equity portion of their portfolios: many of them are underweight,
holding less than 60 per cent in equities when the limit is as much as 75
per cent.
One unfashionable area which could receive some of these institutional funds
is gold shares which have been sharply downrated over the past three years
as the gold index declined from a peak of 2,250 to current levels of about
800, with a 30 per cent fall in 1992 alone.
Mr Mike Wuth, mining analyst at brokers Rice Rinaldi says that this
correction has largely removed the speculative angle from gold. Now, he
says, gold has to offer decent returns and compete more directly with
industrial shares.
However few analysts hold out much hope for a higher gold price in the short
term and a weakening rand is only likely to offer limited benefit.
But one way that profits can be improved is through further cost cutting
measures and the December gold quarterly results of mining houses confirm
the impressive progress that has been made in this direction. With the
dividend yield of the gold index having risen to 6.6 per cent from 3.4 per
cent three years ago, gold shares are now offering better value than for a
number of years.
Mr Wuth forecasts that foreigners are more likely to be buyers of good
shares than local institutions. Many of the latter, he argues, are
historically overweight in gold and so are looking for opportunities to
lighten their holdings.
Overseas institutions, of course, will be wary of the vagaries of the
financial rand investment unit, which started 1992 at a discount of 14 per
cent to the commercial rand and ended at a discount of 37 per cent.
But the political outlook and recent steps taken to bolster the currency,
make any further weakening from current levels unlikely.
