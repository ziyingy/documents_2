EL SALVADOR'S defence minister has offered to resign, after the US
threatened to withhold military aid unless he and other blacklisted officers
were removed in 15 days.
The offer by Mr Emilio Ponce, described by El Salvador's vice-president as a
'patriotic and positive gesture', came as the United Nations prepared to
publish today a long-awaited report on human rights atrocities in the 1980s.
The report is expected to name high-ranking military officers, politicians,
businessmen and some guerrillas as responsible for war crimes and human
rights abuses.
President Alfredo Cristiani, under pressure from the army and his right-wing
party, has struggled to block the publication of the report, arguing that
this would further inflame tensions and damage the process of national
reconciliation.
Mr Ponce was one of more than 100 military officers who had to be purged
under the UN peace accords signed last year, but Mr Cristiani refused to
sack him and 14 other senior officers. The pressure from the US to remove
offending officers is the first sign of its flexing its muscles in Central
America.
After announcing his offer, Mr Ponce published a Defence Ministry analysis
of the dangers facing El Salvador: 'Communism has not disappeared. In El
Salvador, its immediate objective is the destruction of the armed forces to
consummate its assault on power.'
