THE SUGAR industries of Guyana and Barbados have been crippled by strikes as
millers and unions argue over higher wages.
Guyana's 20,000 sugar workers have left the country's eight mills idle to
support their union's demand for wage increases of 100 per cent. The Guyana
Sugar Corporation, the country's sole producer, says it cannot pay that
much.
The strike comes amid indications of a recovery in output by the Guyanese
industry. Production so far this year of about 90,000 tonnes is slightly
more than double the output in the corresponding period of last year.
The union representing sugar workers in Barbados said the strike in that
island followed the refusal of the milling company, Barbados Sugar Industry,
to pay workers a bonus agreed earlier. The company claims the formula for
the bonus has not been agreed with the union. The sugar harvest was delayed
by an eight-week strike, and the industry, which is forecasting output of
55,000 tonnes, has had to import to meet home demand.
