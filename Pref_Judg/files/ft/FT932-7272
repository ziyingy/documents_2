THE Tories have fallen to fourth place in Scotland, where they have the
support of only 16 per cent of voters, an opinion poll for The Herald
newspaper in Glasgow suggested yesterday.
Voting intentions were: the Labour party 44 per cent, the Scottish National
party 22 per cent, the Liberal Democrats 17 per cent and the Tories 16 per
cent.
