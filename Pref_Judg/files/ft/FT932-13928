Shares of Vizcaya Holdings, the USM-quoted mining and exploration group,
were suspended yesterday at the company's request at 5 3/4 p.
The move was in connection with discussions about a possible large
acquisition.
Mr Desmond Bloom, chairman, said that the company intended to reorganise and
focus on property investment.
