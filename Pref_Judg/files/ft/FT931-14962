Arjo-Wiggins Appleton, the Franco-British paper group, has made a series of
appointments which it hopes will reassure its British shareholders.
Last year the company had a torrid relationship with its main shareholders
following the sacking of its British chief executive, the resignation of a
senior British non-executive director and its decision to cut the dividend.
So now AWA has appointed two British non-executive directors, George Loudon
(pictured right) and Sir Charles Powell, both described by the company as
'heavyweights with strong views'.
These appointments redress the balance on the board between French and
British non-executives to three each.
British investors have been concerned that St Louis, a French group with
39.6 per cent of AWA's shares, has been exercising too much control, to the
detriment of majority shareholders.
Loudon is a former director of Midland Bank and chairman and chief executive
of its investment banking subsidiary, Midland Montagu. Previously he spent
12 years with AMRO, the largest Dutch bank.
Sir Charles Powell, Margaret Thatcher's former foreign policy adviser, is a
non-executive director of the Jardine Matheson group of companies, of
NatWest - and chairman of its international advisory board - and of Tiphook,
the container group.
At the same time, Gordon Bond, chief operating officer of the highly
successful US operations, has been appointed chief executive of the printing
and writing paper operations in Europe.
This involves responsibility for the European carbonless papers, fine papers
and coated papers divisions. He will also be in charge of Ceasa, the group's
pulp mill in Spain.
Bond is being replaced in the US by Dale Schumaker, currently chief
operating officer of Appleton Papers.
Meanwhile, Ian Kennedy, formerly an executive director at AWA and a
non-executive since July 1992, has resigned, having reached normal
retirement age.
