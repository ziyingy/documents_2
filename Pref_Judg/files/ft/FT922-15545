SWEDEN will allow increased competition in its electricity market in line
with developments in the European Community, the government said yesterday.
Customers will be free to shop around for suppliers offering the lowest
electricity prices in future, and power and other companies will be able to
import and export electricity to neighbouring countries.
Those companies which have a concession to operate power lines in certain
areas will be forced to open their lines to other suppliers and users. In
addition, the government said it was preparing legislation concerning
competition in the electricity market, and promised that its competitiveness
would be 'continually monitored'.
The proposals were welcomed by the Confederation of Swedish Industry
yesterday. Mr Lars Gunnar Larsson, head of the CSI's energy and environment
division, said industry members had been eager to see more competition on
electricity prices.
The government has started to reform the electricity industry already.
Vattenfall, the state-owned electricity company which supplies about half
the country's electricity, is being prepared for wider ownership as part of
the government's ambitious privatisation programme, although no date has
been set yet.
The remaining electricity suppliers are mainly owned by the local
authorities or by private companies. One company - the big forestry group
SCA - recently agreed to sell its power operations in view of the
forthcoming changes in the electricity market.
In the past, many of the electricity-intensive industries had their own
power suppliers so that they could be independent of the regional power
monopolies.
The government said 'substantial gains stand to be made by making the
electricity sector more efficient, and by facilitating increased trade in
electricity across borders'.
