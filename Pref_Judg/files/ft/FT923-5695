PERU has temporarily withdrawn from the Andean Pact, the five-nation trade
bloc which groups it with Bolivia, Colombia, Ecuador and Venezuela, adding
further confusion to the patchwork of trading arrangements developing among
the Andean countries.
Peru will assume observer status in the pact until the end of 1993, when it
is scheduled to resume as a full member. The Peruvian government blamed its
current economic difficulties for its decision to withdraw.
The pact has been in difficulty since Venezuela broke off relations with
Peru in April over the suspension of the Peruvian constitution by President
Alberto Fujimori.
However, the other four members finalised an agreement reached last December
in Colombia on common import duties on a series of products. The duties at
four levels, from 5 to 20 per cent, will take effect on October 31. There
will be a transitional period until the end of 1993.
It also emerged that Colombia and the new government of Ecuador would try to
negotiate their own free trade pact to come into force on September 30.
The governments also agreed to allow member countries greater freedom to
negotiate their own free trade arrangements.
