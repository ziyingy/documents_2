ABOUT 20 Labour back-benchers staged a revolt last night by joining Liberal
Democrat MPs in voting against the bill seeking to ensure that changes in
the boundaries of constituencies are implemented before the next general
election, Ivor Owen writes.
Mr Roy Hattersley, Labour's deputy leader, rejected allegations that the
Boundary Comissions Bill would enable the Tory party to secure between 10
and 20 extra seats. He said it would be wrong to vote against the second
reading.
Labour leaders abstained when the bill was given a second reading by a
government majority of 246 (290-44).
One of the most vociferous of the Labour rebels, Mr Tony Banks, MP for
Newham North West, said the measure should be called the 'Save The Tory
Party at the Next Election Bill'.
Mr Hattersley said he did not believe the bill would damage the Labour party
in the way suggested.
Mr Kenneth Clarke, home secretary, said the bill set a deadline of December
31 1994 for the completion of reviews of the 651 constituencies by the
Boundary Commission.
