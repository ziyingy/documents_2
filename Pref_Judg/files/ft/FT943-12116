The defence secretary yesterday rejected a call for the government to
provide a guaranteed two-year, Pounds 50m workload for Tyneside shipbuilder
Swan Hunter to save it from closure.
Mr Malcolm Rifkind told executives from Constructions Mecaniques de
Normandie, the sole prospective bidder for Swan Hunter as a going concern,
that work could not be directed to the yard and that all future contracts
must be won by competitive tender.
However, Mr Rifkind and Mr Roger Freeman, defence procurement minister, said
they would look at a proposal from the French-based company designed to keep
Swan Hunter in business while it competed for more work.
The CMN plan would require the Ministry of Defence to place the Pounds 6m,
three-month refit of the Royal Fleet Auxiliary tanker Olwen with Swans while
still in receivership.
It is understood that CMN has proposed to underwrite the Olwen contract. It
hopes that increasing the yard's dwindling workload will enable Swans to bid
for new work, especially a ministry ocean survey vessel worth about Pounds
45m, due to be ordered in January.
CMN still says it will only buy the shipbuilder, in receivership since May
1993, if the company has a two-year Pounds 50m base workload. Winning the
ocean survey vessel would satisfy this requirement.
Last week Swans heard that it had lost to Rosyth the refit of the landing
ship Sir Bedivere, but won the Olwen. The government said, however, that
Olwen would go to the next lowest bidder if Swans were not on a firm
financial footing by August 1. CMN hopes the ministry's response to its
proposal will be clear by Friday.
Last night receivers Price Waterhouse said it did not know what CMN's
proposal was, so could not comment.
