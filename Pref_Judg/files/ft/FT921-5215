DAIMLER-BENZ, Germany's largest company, has signalled an important
reorganisation of its electronics activities by carving a new
microelectronics company out of two subsidiaries, AEG and Deutsche
Aerospace, writes Leslie Colitt in Berlin.
The new unit, to be set up in July, was said by DB to mark an important step
in its transition from car producer to integrated technology concern. The
goal was to concentrate similar technologies within the multi-faceted group.
Mr Ernst G. Stockl, AEG chairman, and Mr Jurgen E. Schrempp, chairman of
Deutsche Aerospace, said it would also help substitute future-oriented
civilian activities for declining defence sales.
The company will produce everything from semiconductors to sensors, hybrids
and complete systems.
The as yet unnamed new company is expected to have sales this year of about
DM2.4bn (Dollars 1.4bn) and 16,500 employees.
