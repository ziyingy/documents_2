RESULTS DUE
BRITISH Telecommunications is expected to report on Thursday a drop in
pre-tax profits for the year ended March to about Pounds 2.5bn from Pounds
3bn a year earlier. The fall will be, however, after redundancy payments of
about Pounds 500m and exceptional costs of around Pounds 200m for
restructuring, redemption of bonds and other items. Underlying profit growth
last year was therefore around 2 to 3 per cent. Inland call volumes rose,
helping to offset lower tariffs. Further redundancy costs are expected this
year with the market looking for profits in the Pounds 3.2bn-Pounds 3.5bn
range.
J Sainsbury, the food retailer, is forecast to report on Wednesday a hefty
increase in pre-tax profits for the year ended March to around Pounds 740m
from Pounds 628m a year earlier. Unlike Tesco it has managed to maintain its
growth momentum on sales volume while retaining a grip on costs.
Grand Metropolitan is expected to report first half pre-tax profits of
Pounds 400m to Pounds 413m on Thursday, 2 to 3 per cent ahead of last year's
result, excluding exceptionals. Trading profits from the IDV spirits
business will be boosted by currency translation but the favourable exchange
rate is unlikely to compensate entirely for lower dollar profits from US
food operations.
Royal Dutch Shell group will announce its first quarter results on Thursday
with analysts forecasting a wide range of income figures of between Pounds
600m and Pounds 800m on a replacement cost basis which strips out
stockholding losses and gains. The company reported a profit of Pounds 770m
in the same period last year, but this was buoyed by one-off exceptional
items. The results will signal how successful the company has been at
cutting costs and maintaining its profits against a background of falling
oil prices and deteriorating sales margins.
Body Shop is forecast to report on Wednesday a drop in pre-tax profits for
the year to February of about 20 per cent to around Pounds 20m. While
international expansion continues apace, UK prices and margins have slipped
and volume growth has faltered.
