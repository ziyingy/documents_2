EMPLOYERS paid a total of Pounds 470,000 in compensation to employees in 120
racial discrimination cases brought to industrial tribunals by the
Commission for Racial Equality last year. The comparable figure for 1990 was
little more than Pounds 150,000.
The increase partly reflects a number of substantial damages awards and
agreed settlements by employers. The Metropolitan Police, for example, paid
about Pounds 20,000 last year in settlement of one case of alleged racist
abuse.
The rise in compensation also reflects the continuing increase in the number
of people bringing complaints - the commission says the number has risen by
about 10 per cent a year for several years.
Of 1,203 individuals who approached the commission last year, 19 won their
cases at tribunals and 101 accepted out-of-tribunal settlements.
More than 200 people complained of employers refusing to consider them for
employment or offer it to them, and a similar number complained that they
had been refused promotion because of racial discrimination.
About 800 complained of unfair dismissal while fewer than 20 complained of
victimisation after making complaints against employers.
The commission, which has been criticised for taking up only cases it knows
it can win, decided to give full advice in 342 cases.
By comparison, the Equal Opportunities Commission 'won' 40 of the 58 cases
of discrimination at work that reached a conclusion in 1990. Seven
applicants won their cases in tribunals while 33 settled out of tribunal.
