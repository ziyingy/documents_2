China is using new religious laws to crack down on foreign missionary
activity with the arrest in the past week of seven foreign Christians.
Amnesty International, the human rights organisation, urged China to release
all those arrested.
US officials in Beijing said they had been informed that three American
citizens among the seven arrested had been released.
Earlier this month, China gave notice that it was cracking down on foreign
missionaries with the publication of new laws aimed at improving religious
'management'.
News of the arrests of foreign Christians in central Henan province
coincides with Beijing's efforts to persuade the outside world that it is
improving its human rights record.
President Clinton is obliged within the next few months to decide whether
China has made an 'overall, significant improvement' in its human rights
performance that would justify renewal of its Most Favoured Nation trading
status. International human rights organisations including Amnesty
International have intensified pressure on China and on the US
administration in the lead-up to the MFN decision.
An estimated 96 per cent of China's exports to the US are covered by MFN.
China's new religious decree expressly bans foreigners from setting up
religious organisations, schools or offices.
Foreigners have also been forbidden to cultivate religious disciples among
Chinese citizens, and appoint religious clergy.
