ABSENTEEISM may have taken over from strikes as the British disease,
according to evidence published today by the Industrial Society. It says
workers in Japanese-owned companies in the UK take far fewer days off sick
than those working for home-owned companies.
Sickness absence is two-thirds higher for UK organisations than their
Japanese counterparts. The absence rate - the percentage of working days
lost a year - is 3.9 per cent for UK companies and 2.35 per cent for
Japanese-owned groups.
The findings come from a survey of 600 organisations by the Industrial
Society following employer concern about levels of absence among workers.
Government figures show that more than 200m working days and more than
Pounds 9bn in production is lost each year.
But the survey also shows that the absence rate for UK companies is down
substantially from 5.05 per cent in 1987. The recession was seen by managers
to have had a mixed effect - some employees improved their attendance
because they feared for their jobs, but others suffered increased stress.
The survey found Japanese companies could have greater success in
controlling sick leave because of better employee communications about the
number of absences and smaller working groups. Japanese companies were more
likely to ask candidates about their attendance record at interviews, and
find out why employees were away after every absence, however short.
Overall, managers did not always believe the reasons for absence offered by
workers. More than half of managers felt emotional and personal problems and
stress caused more absence than their employees were prepared to admit on
certification forms.
