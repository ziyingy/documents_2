OF ALL diseases, none has a more fearsome reputation than rabies. For
reasons no one can explain, it died out in Europe during the later part of
the 19th and first half of the 20th century. In 1939, though, there was an
ominous outbreak close to the Polish-German frontier. Since then  - spread
mainly by red foxes - the virus has travelled inexorably west across Europe
at a rate of about 40 kilometres a year.
Rabies was eradicated from Britain by 1903, but with fox-borne rabies now
only just across the English Channel, some scientists are convinced that it
will soon be back. In 1986, James Murray, professor of mathematical biology
at Oxford University, published a computer model warning that rabies will
return to Britain - and will spread rapidly.
Prof Murray points to the rarity of deaths from rabies in Britain, where it
seems never to have reached epidemic proportions.
In Murray's view, however, the Channel Tunnel will be an irrelevance as far
as the spread of rabies is concerned. English sentimentality about animals
and the vast number of pleasure craft crossing the Channel make it
inevitable that one day a pet animal will come ashore somewhere - and
reintroduce the virus.
When that happens, the British, like their neighbours and most of the rest
of the world, will need to become accustomed to viewing parks, woods and
fields as the haunt of a lurking killer.
In the early 5th century, St Augustine of Hippo compiled a daunting list of
the disasters that may at any moment fall on our defenceless heads:
insanity, bankruptcy, imprisonment, torture, fire, stroke. Among them he
included rabies.
Fifteen centuries later, does rabies really deserve its horrifying image?
After all, rabies vaccine is available both as a prophylactic and for
treating those who have been in contact with an infected animal. Vaccinated
bait is widely and expensively used in programmes intented to control the
spread of the disease among wildlife.
Yet the horrors of rabies can hardly be less fundamental today than when it
stalked the cities of Roman North Africa. There is still no known cure. Once
clinical symptoms appear - fever, headache and 'a sense of apprehension' -
its victims are doomed to a horrible death.
Both in France and in England, it used to be common practice to suffocate
victims under mattresses. Read any description of the effect of rabies and
one sees the case for euthanasia. In its most common form, furious rabies,
sufferers develop hydrophobia - a dread of water  - which has been described
by Prof David Warrell, an expert in tropical medicine, as 'the most terrible
and mysterious symptom in the whole of medicine.' Rabies, says Warrell,
'remains the most . . . hopeless of human infections.'
In short, there is little room for late 20th-century complacency. All the
more reason, then, to look with interest, if bemusement, at an extraordinary
healing cult that flourished in a small village in north-west Europe for
nine centuries. Fear does strange things to people and so does hope. Those
two emotions, working powerfully together, with a dash of the profit motive
thrown in, played a large role in the extraordinary and little-known history
of St Hubert of the Ardennes.
St Hubert was an early 8th-century bishop of Liege who preached Christianity
in the Ardennes. A century after his death, monks carried his holy (and
still incorrupt - ie, not mouldy) corpse from its grave in a church in Liege
to an impoverished monastery high in the forest of the Ardennes.
The abbot and his monks badly needed a miracle-working relic to boost morale
and attract pilgrims, and St Hubert conveniently started to perform healing
miracles in his tomb. After miraculous cures, many grateful pilgrims settled
nearby, some of them with useful trades to ply, such as blacksmith.
And so, thanks to a saint's holy bones, a village sprang up. Today
Saint-Hubert-les-Ardennes is a charming, slate-roofed town modestly famous
as the birthplace of the flower-painter Redoubte - and for the fetes de
Saint-Hubert.
St Hubert is still known and loved throughout catholic northern Europe as
the patron saint of hunters. The tourist office, housed in the former
mansion of the mighty abbots of Saint-Hubert, dispenses leaflets telling the
picturesque legend of the saint's conversion. Sadly - but not untypically -
the legend has nothing to do with the real St Hubert. It is a barefaced
example of monastic plagiarism, lifted from the Life of St Eustace.
The story goes that Hubert, a young nobleman, went hunting on Good Friday
and was confronted by a white stag with a crucifix between its antlers.
Christ reproached Hubert, whereupon he decided to enter the Church.
On September 25 and November 3, mass is celebrated in honour of St Hubert in
the town's magnificent gothic church, punctuated by huntsmen blowing
fanfares. Tourists turn up for the fete in September, which is modestly
promoted by the Belgian tourist office as a hunting festival: St Hubert
still has a role to play in bringing revenue to his town. In November, the
atmosphere is more obviously spiritual. Local people bring dogs and even
horses to be blessed.
In all this ceremony, there is nothing to remind visitors that the key to St
Hubert's centuries of fame was his reputation as the saint who could prevent
 -and cure - rabies. As early as the 11th century, a monk wrote that it was
standard practice for people bitten by rabid dogs and wolves to visit the
shrine.
What happened there was very odd indeed and quite without parallel in the
history of medieval shrines. A priest would make a cut in the pilgrim's
forehead and push in a thread pulled from the saint's episcopal stole.
Later, the monks claimed that this stole had been woven in Heaven by the
Virgin Mary and flown down to the saint by an angelic messenger.
As for the origin of the ritual, known as la taille, it is surely an
instance of sympathetic magic. In antiquity, rabies was one of many diseases
blamed on worms - relatives of the poet William Blake's 'invisible worm that
flies in the night.' Worms, under a dog's tongue or in its anus, were
thought to cause rabies. It could well be that someone decided that because
a white thread resembles a worm, it might expel the diabolic sickness of
rabies if placed inside the head, close to the soul. With the saint
literally under their skin, people would not only be 'inoculated' against
the risk of rabies: it was claimed they could be cured of the disease.
The disappearance of St Hubert's holy relics when Huguenots sacked the abbey
was - and is - keenly felt. However, the holy stole was safe, so the
pilgrimage was unaffected. Moreover, it was said that the holy stole never
became any shorter. Whether or not that is true, today it is a length of
silk 105cm by 42mm of 11th- or 12th-century workmanship. Normally, it can be
seen in a reliquary on one of the altars. However, on November 3, after
mass, when the church has almost emptied, a priest holds it to the heads of
the more devout.
In the 17th century, doctors of Paris University attacked the credibility of
the stole and were furiously rebutted by supporters of this enormously
popular pilgrimage. Proof of its appeal is the sheer size of the church, its
marble floor and magnificently carved stalls. Records, kept at the shrine
from 1653, were continued even after the abbey was secularised in the French
revolution. Early in the 18th century, a monk had noted that in four years,
1,956 people had been given la taille. Between 1806 and 1834, some 4,800
were still seeking out St Hubert's healing power.
La taille still had its devotees in the 1920s. It was said to be common for
people fearful of contracting rabies to go to the Pasteur Instititue in
Paris for inoculation, and - just to make sure - visit St Hubert.
What, we may ask, was going on? How could people have been deluded for so
long into thinking that a visit to this saint's shrine had power over this
most terrible of diseases? On the face of it, the pilgrimage must seem like
a mockery, a tragic waste of effort and expense. The only justification
would seem to be that during an agonising period of uncertainty, as
sufferers and families waited to see if the dread symptoms appeared, the
pilgrimage offered solace.
But there are more things to be said in explanation of the long 'success' of
the pilgrimage to St Hubert. Many of the pilgrims must simply have made a
mistake. They thought they had been bitten by a mad beast, but it ran off so
they had no proof. Only pilgrims brought to the abbey from homes within a
few days' journey could possibly have had furious rabies, since death occurs
swiftly.
Many raging, barking, convulsing wretches who were tied to an iron ring by
St Hubert's altar to await la taille must have been malades imaginaires.
They were suffering from rabies hysteria, a strange phenomenon which has
been well documented in countries where rabies is prevalent. Deluded
sufferers are said to exhibit a terrifying range of symptoms associated with
furious rabies.
Doctors today suspect that they are dealing with this bizarre phenomenon
whenever the symptoms follow hard on the heels of an animal bite. One of the
horrible features of rabies is that the virus commonly lies dormant for
between 12 and 60 days. The hysteric gives the game away by claiming he or
she has been bitten only hours or a day or so earlier. At the shrine, many
an hysteric was no doubt swiftly 'cured' the instant they received the
supernatural thread.
Conversely, and tragically, there were people who made the journey on foot,
horse, or latterly by train, received la taille and, once they got home,
faithfully kept the novena, the nine days of ritual observance. It appeared
they were cured, for the virus can take two years to become active. In the
end, they succumbed.
Did anyone then think to inform the priest at Saint-Hubert, let alone accuse
St Hubert of impotence?
The 'fail-safe' principle that explained the success of so many healing
cults was not that Christianity taught that God's power, and that of his
saints, worked automatically; on the contrary, God's power was an abyss
which the mind of man could not plumb. The silk stole of a saint was like a
ladder over the abyss.
Many would cross in safety thanks to the power of their faith and the
prayers of their loved ones. But some would perish. Even here, though, faith
held out comfort to the bereaved - the thought that all those hours of
racking agony would surely incline God to mercy at the hour of judgment.
Today, rabies is at large once more in Europe. But there is no sign, so far,
of a return of the cast of mind which, for nine centuries, gave St Hubert's
stole its power.
