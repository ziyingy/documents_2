INTERNATIONAL Business Machines is exploring the possibility of selling all
or part of its Federal Systems Company, a US-based division that sells
computers and services to the Federal government.
IBM said it had been contacted by several companies interested in acquiring
all or part of FSC. In the past, similar inquiries have been turned down.
