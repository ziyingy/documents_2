PT Barito Pacific Timber, Indonesia's largest manufacturer of timber
products, said net income in the first six months of 1994 rose to Rp103bn
(Dollars 47m) from Rp82bn a year earlier.
The company also reported that net sales increased to Rp481bn from Rp462bn
the year before.
Barito Pacific has come under fire recently for management at its forest
concessions.
The company, which ranks as the world's largest tropical hardwood plywood
manufacturer, is majority owned by Mr Prajogo Pangestu.
Mr Pangestu recently agreed to allow the Indonesian government to take a 49
per cent stake in two of the forest concessions he operates and which supply
Barito Pacific with timber.
The Ministry of Forestry said that the move was aimed at improving
management at the forest concessions.
