Sir, I should like to correct the alarmingly optimistic figure for the area
of this planet which is covered by tropical forest, given in your article,
'FAO cuts estimate of tropical forest loss' (March 9). This states that 37
per cent of the planet is covered in tropical forest.
It states correctly that, according to FAO figures, 1.75bn hectares of
tropical forest remain; however, this is not 37 per cent of the planet. It
is 3.4 per cent of the total area of the planet and 11.6 per cent of the
total land surface of the planet.
More alarming for those of us trying to preserve the biodiversity of the
species-rich tropical rainforest is that it has now been reduced to 0.83bn
hectares, or only 5.5 per cent of the total land surface.
There is no room for complacency if we are to preserve this ecosystem which
is so vital for the functioning of our planet.
