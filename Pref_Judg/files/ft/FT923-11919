MR LOU Guttman, chairman of the New York Mercantile Exchange, the world's
largest energy market, has been forced to take a leave of absence from his
duties, effective July 31, because of possible civil charges against him
from the Commodity Futures Trading Commission, the US futures industry
regulator.
Earlier this month, the CFTC's enforcement division served notice on Mr
Guttman that it was preparing to ask the commission to file an
administrative complaint against him and a former partner, Mr Harold Magid,
because of a series of allegedly pre-arranged trades in 1989.
With that notification, the CFTC invited a response from Messrs Guttman and
Magid, and once they have replied the commission will vote on whether to
bring charges. The supposedly prearranged trades, which were executed by Mr
Magid for the Guttman-Magid trading partnership called Harley Futures, did
not involve customer monies and therefore do not entail charges of fraud.
The joint venture was liquidated in 1990.
In a letter to the board of Nymex, Mr Guttman emphatically denied that he
was responsible for any wrongdoing.
Mr Barry Bohrer, Mr Guttman's lawyer, says that Mr Guttman will respond to
the CFTC by the end of the month, arguing that the Nymex chief should not be
held responsible for the allegedly illegal trades because he had nothing to
do with them.
Mr Guttman has been Nymex chairman since 1988 and was not actively engaged
in his trading partnership. He decided on taking a leave of his day-to-day
duties as Nymex chairman in order not to have a cloud over the exchange. The
futures industry has frequently been rocked by trading scandals and Mr
Guttman appears to want to leave Nymex as untarnished as possible.
In 1990, Mr Karsten Mahlmann, then chairman of the Chicago Board of Trade,
was forced to resign from his post because his trading firm, Stotler &amp;
Company, was charged with fraud.
