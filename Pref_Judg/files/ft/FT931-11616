THE cost to the Church of England of compensating clergy who decide to
retire in protest at November's decision to permit women's ordination may
run into millions.
Mr Michael Alison, answering on behalf of the church commissioners, said the
cost of compensation was likely to be 'in the region of Pounds 1m per 100
clergy retiring per annum'.
