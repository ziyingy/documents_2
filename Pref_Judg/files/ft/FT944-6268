Michael Watson, 52: Bought traditional tobacconist's in Newcastle with
redundancy payment from Post Office administration job in 1990 - the last
year it made a profit. Turnover in steady decline because of 'smuggled
tobacco' brought across the Channel for personal consumption, then sold
illegally in pubs, clubs and car boot sales.
Politics: A Conservative voter, he is outraged at the government's lack of
action on this revenue-loser. May not vote in next general election.
Wanted: Expected no help from the Budget, or the government.
Said yesterday: 'I'm disappointed he hasn't been more positive about tobacco
smuggling. But I'd expected maybe a bit more tax on cigarettes. The National
Insurance holiday for taking somebody out of work for two years won't affect
me. Until they get this cross border smuggling sorted out there's no
likelihood I will be able to employ anybody. Will it make me more likely to
vote Conservative next time? No, I don't think so. There's just something
not right with them at the moment.'
