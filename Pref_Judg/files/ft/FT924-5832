The Indian government was yesterday urged to scrap a Dollars 190m (Pounds
125.8m) contract to import high-technology railway locomotives from Asea
Brown Boveri (ABB), writes Stefan Wagstyl in New Delhi. India's railway
advisory panel said it should develop its own advanced locomotives instead
of buying foreign imports. The Dollars 4m spent on commitment payments to
ABB should not inhibit reconsidering the contract. ABB declined comment
before studying the report.
