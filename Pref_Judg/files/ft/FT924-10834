THE State Energy Commission of Western Australia said yesterday it would
consider a revised proposal from Asea Brown Boveri (ABB), the Swiss/Swedish
engineering group, to develop a ADollars 2bn (Pounds 840m) power station,
writes Kevin Brown from Sydney.
The project appeared close to collapse two weeks ago after the state
government indicated that it would not accept ABB's proposed electricity
prices, or its attempts to win state-government financial support. The
commission said a revised bid would be considered by a special board meeting
next week.
