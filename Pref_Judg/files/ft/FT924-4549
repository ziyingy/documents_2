MR Kenneth Clarke, Britain's home secretary, sounds more than usually smug
these days.
'There's no member state actually proposing to remove all its frontier
controls (on people) during 1993,' he said after Monday's meeting of EC
interior minister - their last gathering before the single market deadline
of January 1.
For Britain, which has always opposed lifting controls on people, the
unwillingness or inability of more enthusiastic countries to abolish
passport checks is a relief.
It reduces the risk of embarrassment on December 31, when, as president of
the EC, the UK will be duty-bound to declare the single market open.
Mr Martin Bangemann, EC internal market commissioner, has long since shelved
threats of legal action against countries which retain controls. There is
still nothing to stop federalist MEPs or free-travel zealots taking the UK
to the European Court for retaining passport checks and breaking EC rules on
free movement of people - but Britain claims it will not be alone in the
dock.
The nine members of the Schengen free-travel zone - all the EC countries
except the UK, Denmark and Ireland - are unlikely to abolish their controls
before the middle of next year. They are worried because agreements to
strengthen external EC frontiers are not yet in place, and their own
information system - linking immigration authorities - is not ready.
EC airports, which have to rebuild terminals to separate international and
EC flight arrivals, have been given until December 1993 to get ready for the
new regime.
Denmark and Ireland, for different reasons, will retain checks at borders at
least until the continental EC countries have completed their free-travel
zone, if not longer.
So as far as passport controls are concerned, what will change on January 1?
The short answer is nothing. In practice, travellers across most land
borders on continental Europe will not have their passports checked; air
travellers will. British controls at air and sea borders will be unaltered.
A two- or three-speed Europe, in which passport controls are lifted only
gradually, seems inevitable.
But Mr Clarke's intransigence has still angered Britain's EC partners. At
Monday's meeting, he refused to endorse a compromise proposal which would
have pledged EC countries to remove 'systematic' border checks during 1993.
Afterwards he said there would be no point in talking about border controls
again until other member states had made further progress.
They point out that Mr Clarke's claim that nobody is ready to lift controls
obscures one basic difference between Schengen and Britain. Schengen
countries are still determined to abolish passport checks. But the most
Britain will do is move to a minimal system of controls on EC travellers at
sea-ports,
which would still be unacceptable to the Schengen countries.
For all Mr Clarke's smugness, it is clear that the question of border
controls has only been delayed, not solved.
Plans for EC-wide co-ordination of the fight against drug trafficking were
blocked yesterday by a dispute between interior ministers about where a
European drugs unit should be located. The ministers, meeting in London,
decided to pass the issue on to the Edinburgh summit.
