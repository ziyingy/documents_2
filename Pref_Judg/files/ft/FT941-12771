Mrs Eva Maria Geer no longer believes the politicians in Bonn. 'Why should
I? They made all these promises about rapid prosperity in east Germany,' she
said, holding her youngest daughter. 'From my experience, when people talk
about becoming competitive, it means cutting jobs. That makes it all the
more depressing for my chances of re-entering the labour market.'
Like many of her friends, Mrs Geer used to work in the local shipyards in
the east German city of Rostock. Before reunification in 1989, the yards
employed more than 25,000 people. Today, fewer than 5,000 work at the docks.
In 1991, Mrs Geer became pregnant. Her husband fell ill. At the end of her
maternity leave, she received a letter stating her job was no longer
available.
Mrs Geer dismissed the 30-point economic plan unveiled by the government
last week as rhetoric. Aimed at increasing workplace flexibility and
improving competitiveness, it is regarded by many of east Germany's
unemployed as irrelevant. The plan includes help for start-up companies in
the form of low-interest loans, encouragement for the long-term unemployed
to take low-paid work and the promotion of part-time employment in the state
and private sectors.
But such proposals only induce scepticism among voters. As the campaigning
gets under way for a marathon round of local and state elections in March,
the plight of east Germany's 1.17m unemployed and the cost to the west
German taxpayer are starting to dominate the political debate.
Candidates are finding it an uphill struggle to convince east Germans that
the labour market will improve, even though their economy is forecast to
grow by about 6 per cent this year.
Apart from the official unemployment statistics there is an additional
problem: nearly 2m east Germans are classified as working but are either on
short-time, retraining, or job-creation schemes. The combined cost to the
government of east German unemployment benefits, plus funding for the
schemes, was more than DM45bn (Pounds 17.1bn) last year.
Unemployment in east Germany has been exacerbated by several factors. First
among them is the unrealistic wage agreement between IG Metall, the
engineering union, and west German employers to equalise eastern and western
wages by 1996, despite eastern productivity rates running at about 50 per
cent of those in the west. Second, the rush towards privatisation has meant
the closure of many enterprises in east Germany.
Mr Rainer Schondube, a board member of Germanischer Lloyd, the Hamburg-based
shipping insurance company which took over its east German counterpart in
1990, said: 'Wage levels are the main contributing factor to unemployment.'
But Mr Schondube believes it would have been more socially acceptable for
the government to subsidise unnecessary jobs temporarily than to support
large numbers of unemployed in east Germany.
'We have heard all the arguments about over-employment in the east German
enterprises, which is true. But for political stability and for the morale
of the people, it would have been better to finance jobs rather than
unemployment,' he said.
Amid the disillusionment at broken promises about how reunification would
improve living standards in east Germany - and, in Chancellor Helmut Kohl's
memorable words, lead to 'a blossoming landscape' - there is no shortage of
east Germans willing to go to extremes to find work.
Mr Werner Rosler is one of 360,000 commuters who work in west Germany. For
the past two years, he has each Sunday evening made the two-and-a-half-hour
train journey from Rostock to Hamburg. During the week, he works at
Germanischer Lloyd, a tall building overlooking the docks.
'I'm one of the lucky ones, especially at my age. I am 51. I have had the
chance to retrain and have a permanent job. Of course, I would prefer to
spend time with my family in Rostock. But I have to make compromises,' he
said.
Across Hamburg, in the north-east of the city, is Otto Versand, the giant
mail-order business which last year had a consolidated turnover of DM21.2bn
and employs 44,000 worldwide. Otto Versand continues to expand. Despite
Hamburg's unemployment rate of 9.2 per cent, the management cannot find
local staff for the packaging department.
'They are too qualified, or else they do not want to do this kind of work,'
explained Mr Detlev Livonius, head of public relations.
Instead, the company employs more than 500 commuters from the north-eastern
state of Mecklenberg-Vorpommern, part of the former East Germany. 'Each day,
we send buses to collect these commuters. Over 80 per cent are women. They
work in the evening shift which starts at 5pm. And we bring them back home
at 11pm.'
Mr Livonius said Otto Versand is reaping no benefit on labour costs. 'We pay
the commuters from eastern Germany the same rates as here in Hamburg. We
cover insurance and everything else. The big difference is these people are
highly motivated and flexible. They work really hard.' The commuters travel
a total of 100 miles each day.
On the other side of Germany, Miss Katarina Fend, 21, from Rostock is living
in Coblenz. She finished studying as a midwife last year. But there were no
jobs in Rostock, her home town. 'The birth rate is plummeting in eastern
Germany. Jobs in hospitals and private practices are at a premium. So last
year I applied for a place near Coblenz. I got it. But I miss my friends. I
hope to return to Rostock, if and when the economy picks up,' she said.
Once a month she returns home to the east. 'There is no point in
complaining. There's no point in waiting for a job to turn up at home,' she
said.
Miss Fend is one of the lucky ones. As unemployment rises in west Germany,
the numbers commuting from the east are falling. In 1991, more than half a
million east Germans travelled either to west Germany, or to west Berlin, on
a daily or weekly basis. 'The official figures show unemployment has stopped
rising in eastern Germany so maybe some commuters have found work at home,'
said Ms Melanie Nassauer, an official at Berlin's federal employment office.
In 1992, the unemployment rate in east Germany topped 17 per cent. Last
year, it dipped to 15 per cent.
'But you have to look at the reality behind the official statistics,' she
added. 'What is happening is that some people, many women, for example, have
dropped off the unemployment register and now only receive welfare. In
addition, job-creation schemes are being cut because there's no money. So
these people, who are in fact jobless, do not show up on the unemployment
figures. It's pretty dismal.'
Neither Ms Nassbauer, nor her colleagues in the employment offices in
Hamburg or Rostock, can decide if unemployment benefits are so high that
they act as a disincentive for people to seek work. Although wages in the
east are only about 75 per cent of those in west Germany, benefits are
calculated on the same scale and based on the last monthly salary. For those
on short-time work, the outlook is better: they receive federal short-time
pay (equal to unemployment benefits) but remain on a company's books and can
be called upon to work.
'To tell you honestly, I had enough money to live on when I was put on
short-time work,' said east Berliner, Ms Silke Richter, a 33-year-old
languages graduate and mother of three, who works as a personal assistant.
'From late 1991 until April 1992, I received DM1,400 a month, or 90 per cent
of my last (net) salary. But there was hardly any work to do. We call it
null, or zero work. I was then made redundant, so for a while I received 72
per cent of my net salary. Later I received unemployment money, which is 67
per cent of my last salary. But I had to get a job because I was going
crazy.'
For the unemployed in Rostock, the commuters in Hamburg and the re-employed
in Berlin, reunification has brought differing experiences. But they are
united on one thing: the need to get east Germany working is paramount. It
is not enough to receive federal money to remain at home, when factories are
closing daily and west German taxpayers are resentful about the level of
subsidies for the east.
'The politicians keep telling us about how much they are spending on the
unemployed in the east,' said Mrs Geer. 'But don't they understand that
paying us to stay at home cannot compensate for our sudden loss of dignity
and status? If any party can come up with a plan to create jobs, I'll give
it my vote.'
