MILLIONS of workers in third world countries are subject to forced labour
and governments are not doing enough to stamp it out and punish offenders,
the International Labour Organisation said yesterday.
The ILO's annual World Labour Report highlights cases of traditional slavery
in Africa, debt bondage in Asia, forms of 'white slavery' in Latin America
and sale of children to sweatshops and brothels.
Traditional slavery persists in Mauritania and in Sudan, where it appears to
be on the increase because of the nine-year civil war, the report says.
Unofficial militia groups in Sudan, allegedly aided by the government, have
raided villages of the Dinka tribe, looting property and taking slaves.
Sudanese peasants are also selling their children, mostly boys aged 7-12 who
fetch about Dollars 70 (Pounds 49), the ILO says.
The report says 20m workers, including 7.5m children, may be bonded
labourers in Pakistan, in the brick-kiln industry, fish-cleaning,
shoe-making, agriculture and quarrying.
