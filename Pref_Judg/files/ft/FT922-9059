TO SAVE that camellia and beat the hosepipe ban, you splash down two flights
of stairs with last night's bath water in a leaking can. Now the bath tub is
scratched, the carpet is wet and your right shoulder hurts. Surely there
must be a better way for you and the garden to survive these greenhouse
summers?
There is. In fact, there are three:
Water less but better.
Catch and store rain water.
Recycle bath and sink water without using buckets.
All these solutions are simple. All could contribute to more beautiful
gardens and reduce water consumption. A garden sprinkler uses as much water
in 30 minutes as a family of four consumes in a day of eating, drinking,
bathing and flushing. This information comes from Thames Water, the company
supplying water to much of London and surrounding areas. Thames has joined
the Royal Botanic Gardens at Kew to produce a guide on how to quench a
garden's thirst without wasting water or damaging the plants.
Kew has cut back drastically on its watering over the past few dry years,
with no harmful effects to its collection. These are its basic tips:
Help the soil to retain moisture by digging-in bulky organic material such
as manure or compost.
Mulch exposed soil with compost, manure, gravel or bark.
Water new plants thoroughly when planting.
Remove weeds regularly; they take moisture and nutrients from the soil.
Water thoroughly but infrequently - this encourages stronger growth.
Ensure that plant species from dry climates are not over-watered.
Use rainwater to supplement the mains supply.
A modest house, or even a garden shed, can catch a surprising amount of
water from the roof - around 12,000 gallons a year from a small house. The
easiest and cheapest way to store it is in a simple plastic butt, available
from garden centres or by mail order for under Pounds 30. None of these
predominantly green tubs is pleasing aesthetically, but they can be hidden
behind a climber or painted to camouflage their presence.
Some garden centres also stock large oak barrels which have been converted
into butts. These cost around Pounds 80 and look a lot better than the
plastic versions. They must never be allowed to dry out and should also get
a yearly coat of oil or wood preservative.
Butts can be placed some distance away from the downpipe by using special
attachments that connect to it and a length of hose. Two of the most popular
are the Rainmate (Pounds 19.95 from Agriframes) and the Rainmiser (Pounds
15.95 from Blackwall). Both are installed as an integral part of the
downpipe, allowing water to flow to the tank but cutting it off when the
butt is full.
A drawback is that a typical butt stores about 45 gallons, which is only a
little more than a sprinkler could consume in about 30 minutes. A number can
be joined by connecting the overflows, although a row of butts can look very
unsightly.
If you have the space and the need, then it might be sensible to buy a big
tank and bury it, say, under the lawn. This might sound rather radical (and
impossible for many town gardens); but as Britain's climate, especially in
the southern part of England, becomes more Mediterranean, it might be
prudent to do what Mediterraneans have been doing for centuries - storing
water underground.
Once the hole has been covered and the lawn restored, the garden will
benefit from a few thousand gallons of rain water stored prudently over the
winter and extracted in the summer with a small electric pump. Tank
stockists are listed under horticultural and farmers' supplies in the Yellow
Pages.
Prices for a 1,000-gallon tank run from about Pounds 300 (second-hand tanks
are about a third of that) without installation. Expect to pay around Pounds
500 for the whole job.
Such tanks are especially useful if you want to store and recycle your bath
and sink water - called grey water - by using it on the garden. This water
might not be suitable for drinking, but it is only slightly murky, and many
plants appear to thrive on a little Fenjal or Fairy Liquid.
There are three main options for recycling grey water; all involve a
reasonably intelligent plumber. A simple solution is to instal a storage
tank in the loft. This is connected to a valve and pump which fills it
automatically when you pull the plug. The tank is connected to your hosepipe
with pressure supplied by gravity. Alternatively, an underground tank could
be filled directly from the bath and sink and the water pumped through the
hose when needed.
It is essential to separate grey and rain water, using different tanks, and
to use grey water quickly. This is because it contains organic matter that
will both spoil the fresh rain water (ideal for pot plants) and cause an
unpleasant smell as it rots. There is also a small risk of disease. .
A more complicated solution is to purify your grey water. While this is
realistic only for very big gardens or hotels, the idea is quite simple and
sensible.
Before being stored, grey water is filtered through sand or reed beds.
Bacteria living on the roots of the reeds eat the organic matter in the
water. Such a purification system can be made a feature of the garden,
disguised as a pond or fountain.
In the UK, there two bureaucratic problems may hinder potential water
recyclers. Water companies claim they 'own' the grey water and that it is
not necessarily ours to recycle. Their main concern is that devious
consumers will simply run the bath tap to fill their storage tanks during a
hosepipe ban.
Also, environmental health officers might be concerned about a DIY water
treatment works being set up in an urban area. It would be wise to check
with the authorities before spending.
Of course, there is a much simpler but more labour-intensive solution for
re-using grey water. Fit a hose connection to the bath drainage pipe before
it joins the sewer. Position your hose, or connect it to a seepage watering
system, and yell for someone to pull the plug.
