Gambro, the new Swedish recruit to the Wallenberg domain, said yesterday it
was expanding its US operations through the purchase of Dial Medical, a
Florida-based company which produces and markets dialysis concentrates.
The move increases Gambro's share of the US market for dialysis
concentrates, which are used in dialysis machines for kidney treatment, to
around one-third from 7 per cent.
The purchase will also lift annual sales of Gambro's COBE US subsidiary by
Dollars 30m from last year's Dollars 500m level.
COBE Renal Care said the purchase, on undisclosed terms, would broaden its
product range and provide a production capacity it had lacked. It said Dial
Medical had an extensive distribution system for its products.
