Tokyo's financial community welcomed the government package yesterday
although much of the buying had been done last week, when the government had
initially hoped to announce the measures.
The Nikkei average of 225 leading shares, which fell 287.03 points on
Monday, rebounded 236.83, or 1.2 per cent, to 20,251.23.
The bond market, recently depressed by fears of extra supply of government
bonds to finance the income tax cut and economic package, gained ground. The
yield on the No 157 10-year benchmark fell 2.5 basis points to 3.5 per cent
as investors regarded the over-supply factor as already discounted in the
yield.
