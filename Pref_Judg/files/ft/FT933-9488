VENEZUELAN firemen and civil defence crews were yesterday pulling bodies out
of the wreckage of shanty towns ringing Caracas, after tropical storm Bret
hit at the weekend.
The storm killed about 150 people in the capital, according to reports.
Hundreds have been injured and thousands left homeless. Yesterday, residents
were clearing up after the rains (picture left).
Most of the damage occurred in the Caracas metropolitan area, where heavy
rains on Sunday morning battered slum dwellings perched on the city's many
hills, causing mudslides and burying people alive.
The total number of victims was still in doubt yesterday and the government
had not issued official figures.
Caracas newspapers estimated fatalities nationwide could exceed 300.
The US National Weather Service said yesterday that Bret, which was breaking
up as it moved off the Colombian coast, could gain strength before passing
over Central America.
The government of Venezuelan President Ramon Jose Velasquez of has declared
a state of national mourning.
Despite a big fiscal deficit, officials are looking for ways to release
funds for emergency relief.
