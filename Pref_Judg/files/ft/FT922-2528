ICL, the UK-based computer manufacturer in which Fujitsu of Japan has a
majority stake, and Hughes STX, a wholly-owned subsidiary of Hughes
Aircraft, are joining forces to offer large customers security products to
protect their computer networks against intruders, such as hackers.
The companies said yesterday that they had concluded a agreement to jointly
market security systems based on technologies they have developed for the
defence market.
The market for data security products is reckoned to be worth about Dollars
5bn at present and growing at over 20 per cent a year.
The industrial logic of the joint venture is that both companies have long
experience of developing systems to protect military computer networks
against hackers, spies and other unauthorised intruders.
Mr Andrew Roberts, director of ICL's mid-range systems division, said: 'We
have technology and products which were originally developed for the British
government defence market.
'The agreement with Hughes enables us to make them available to the American
defence community. Hughes will assist us in tailoring them for the
commercial market in North America.'
ICL, with a turnover last year of Dollars 3.3bn, is looking for new ways to
penetrate North American markets. In co-operation with its Japanese parent
it is already a leading supplier of point of sale systems.
Hughes, with revenues of about Dollars 8bn, specialises in information
security and systems integration for government and commercial customers.
Its range of products includes masking devices which can make computers
invisible to electro-magnetic eavesdropping.
The threat to commercial networks has grown as companies have developed
networks with a few hundred to many thousands of terminals powered by
computers from several different manufacturers.
The two companies are hoping to generate revenues of Dollars 100m in annual
sales within four years.
