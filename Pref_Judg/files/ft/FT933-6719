THE FIRST UK trial of gene therapy for cystic fibrosis, the country's most
common serious genetic disease, will start today at the Royal Brompton
Hospital, London.
In the four years since the genetic defect responsible for cystic fibrosis
was discovered, scientists have devised two techniques for delivering
correctly functioning copies of the gene to patients' lungs. Lung damage is
the main cause of illness and death from cystic fibrosis.
A US group started clinical tests four months ago using a modified virus to
insert the gene into lung cells. But that trial has been suspended because
the virus seems to inflame patients' lungs.
The Brompton trial uses a different approach, developed by Professor Bob
Williamson's team at St Mary's Hospital Medical School, London, with Dr
David Porteous and colleagues at the Medical Research Council Human Genetics
Unit in Edinburgh.
The new gene is packaged in tiny fat globules called liposomes, which fuse
with the cell membrane. The gene can then work inside the cells to produce
the protein whose absence destroys the lungs of cystic fibrosis patients.
The UK scientists say their technique is 'milder' than the viral approach
and less likely to cause complications. It has successfully corrected CF
symptoms in laboratory mice.
Nine young men are taking part in the first phase of the Brompton trial. One
of them, Mr Darren Keen, 23, from Hemel Hempstead, Hertfordshire, said
yesterday: 'I'm very pleased to be able to help. I'm sure there are no risks
involved.'
The trial has been approved by the government's gene therapy committee and
the hospital's own ethics committee. Dr Duncan Geddes, clinical director of
respiratory medicine, said: 'This raises absolutely no ethical issues. We're
using a gene to treat a disease and not to modify future generations.'
The scientists expect to have preliminary results from the trial within four
months.
