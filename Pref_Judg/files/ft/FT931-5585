NIREX, the controversial planned store for nuclear waste at Sellafield,
might have to be 10 per cent larger than expected if British Nuclear Fuels
wins backing for its proposals for treating foreign customers' nuclear
waste.
BNF, which is battling to get approval for its Pounds 2.8bn Thorp plant for
reprocessing nuclear fuel, has repeatedly said Sellafield would not be a
nuclear dustbin for other countries' waste because plutonium, uranium and
highly radioactive waste would be sent back to customers.
Under proposals for 'waste substitution' being considered by the government
BNF would send back to foreign customers' a greater degree of high-level
radioactive waste but keep the more bulky low-level and intermediate-level
waste in Britain.
BNF said storage of that waste could push up the necessary capacity of
Nirex's proposed rock chamber by 10 per cent.
Critics have argued that the plant might not generate the cashflow that BNF
projects - Pounds 900m in the first decade of operation - partly because
waste storage costs could rise.
BNF denied that its substitution plans had any effect on Thorp's economics.
'Substitution is just a more elegant solution because it means shipping back
a lower volume,' it said.
One tonne of reprocessed fuel produces 10 cubic cm of high-level waste, a
cubic metre of intermediate-level waste and six cubic metres of low-level
waste. Environmentalists have attacked the Nirex proposals because of the
possible risk of groundwater contamination.
Nirex, which agreed with BNF's estimates of the possible increase in
capacity, said 'it would not be a problem in any case - our estimates of
storage are plus or minus 10 per cent'.
