Higher oil and gas prices helped YPF, Argentina's privatised oil group,
increase net profits 14 per cent in the third quarter to Dollars 181m from
Dollars 159m a year ago.
However, operating profit fell slightly over the same period to Dollars 223m
in the quarter to September 30, from Dollars 228m.
Exploration costs more than doubled to Dollars 122m in the first nine
months, part of the company's ambitious investment plans over the next 10
years.
Mr Jose Estenssoro, YPF president and chief executive, said the rise in net
income was due to 'higher crude oil production and prices, higher natural
gas prices and lower asset taxes'. However, increased depreciation and
exploration spending kept operating income flat.
In the first nine months, net revenue from sales slipped 1.3 per cent to
Dollars 2.99bn, partly as a result of 'weather problems' in the second
quarter, but in the third quarter revenue was up by 3.8 per cent to Dollars
1.09bn.
YPF denied local press reports that it had made an oil discovery in Rincon
de los Sauces, in Argentina's central Neuquen basin, but it did confirm that
it was exploring the area.
Mr Christopher Ecclestone of brokers Interacciones said the results were
'good at the bottom line' but that YPF was 'losing position in some areas'
with lower sales of gasoline, diesel and fuel oil. He also pointed out that
bottom-line results were helped by taxes of only Dollars 2m against Dollars
14m a year ago.
