FEARS OF a tighter sugar supply/demand balance in 1992-93 are supporting the
world market, according to reports from two London trade houses.
Raw sugar prices have recently touched eight-month highs, nudging 10 cents a
lb in the New York market, on fears of tight nearby supplies following
damage to the South African crop because of drought.
The trade houses, ED &amp; F. Man and Czarnikow, both point out in reports
published today that in the short term the changing export potential in
several countries will keep the lid on prices. The increasing likelihood of
a 1m-tonne increase in Thailand's crop, compared with the previous season,
together with the availability of exportable surpluses from India and Cuba,
should 'keep significant advances at bay', Man's latest sugar report says.
Man believes that reports of a catastrophic Cuban crop this season at 5m to
5.5m tonnes are unsupported by the evidence and estimates that the crop will
come in at about 6.5m tonnes. It is forecasting a crop of more than 5m
tonnes in Thailand and 12.6m tonnes in India.
The overall balance for the 1991-92 season remains marginally in surplus,
Man says, but it suggests that the situation is likely to be even more
tightly balanced in 1992-93.
Czarnikow's sugar review points out that the extent of the South African
drought has raised questions about the timing and coverage of the El Nino
weather phenomenon.
'Already a major drought is developing in Thailand which, if relief does not
arrive this month, could have serious implications for the next crop,' the
Czarnikow review says. 'If this is part of a regional phenomenon there might
be problems later in the year with the monsoon in India and this will need
to be monitored carefully.'
