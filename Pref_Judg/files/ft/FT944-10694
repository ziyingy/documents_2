London Commodity Exchange COFFEE futures prices leapt yesterday as traders
took the view that Brazil's official crop estimate for 1995-96, expected
today, might be at the lower end of the range of recent forecasts.
The January contract closed at Dollars 3,570 a tonne, Dollars 10 off the
day's high but still Dollars 131 higher on balance, after Brazilian broker
Wolthers and Associates predicted that the crop would be 13.95m bags (60kg
each). On October 26 the Brazilian Government it made a preliminary estimate
of 13m-15m bags.
Traders said the sudden move higher triggered stop-loss buying orders,
especially just above Dollars 3,500 on the January contract. And the move
higher was helped by a rumour highlighted in a Brazilian newspaper that the
government was considering a 10 per cent export tax on coffee.
White SUGAR futures recovered earlier losses to trade at fresh four-year
highs in late afternoon.
'Sentiment is still very firm,' said one trader. 'People are expecting the
market to go even higher.' He cited continued confusion over the future of
the Russian/Cuban oil-for-sugar deal as one of the main bullish factors.
At the London Metal Exchange BASE METALS prices recouped early losses and,
aided by a strong rally in copper and aluminium, ended with most showing
gains at the close.
'A sharp correction was on the cards early today but they turned round
quicker than expected. I think a lot of the afternoon buying was
short-covering,' a trader said.
'These markets are still rather nervous but the (speculators) are not
letting go. . . we could be testing the highs again soon,' said another.
ALUMINIUM had dictated the early trend. News that extra metal from the US
north-west might be available as a result of additional power and of a
possible potline restart at Ghana's Valco sent prices lower.
But once the initial wave of selling had been absorbed an across-the-board
fall in stocks, except for aluminium alloy, was the signal for buyers to
return and movements became rather choppy.
Quality buying and short-covering helped lift the GOLD prices after a
bearish start.
A firmer opening in New York also contributed as the London bullion market
price rose Dollars 2.05 to close at Dollars 385.10 a troy ounce. But
resitance appeared to be capping the recovery, a dealer said.
