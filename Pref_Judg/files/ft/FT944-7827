The Commons agriculture committee will today recommend a wholesale change in
government policy on quarantine for pets, saying it should be replaced
immediately with a cheaper system of vaccinations and blood-testing.
The proposed change, under which pets would require health 'passports',
would apply to dogs and cats entering the UK from other European Union
countries and countries free of rabies. The six-month quarantine would
continue for pets from other destinations.
The committee says: 'We consider that a system such as we propose would
effectively decrease the likelihood (of rabies entering the UK) not least
because the costs of the new procedure, a small fraction of the expense of
quarantine, would no longer provide an incentive for many to smuggle their
animals into this country.'
The cost of quarantine for a 'sizeable dog' can vary between Pounds 600 and
Pounds 1,500, the committee says. The MPs are calling for compensation for
owners of quarantine kennels wishing to leave the industry or convert their
businesses.
But the British Veterinary Association yesterday opposed the immediate
ending of quarantine, saying the EU should first be free of rabies.
The MPs point out that the incidence of animal rabies in the EU has fallen
sharply from 8,506 in 1989 to 1,207 last year, and that the European
Commission believes it will be eradicated within two or three years.
The agriculture committee admits it may have difficulty persuading the
government of its case. 'Neither reform nor replacement of the quarantine
system is under active consideration by the Ministry of Agriculture, which
is adopting a position of Olympian detachment on the issue.'
Under their proposed changes, modelled on measures adopted by Sweden in May,
dogs and cats due to be imported into the UK from approved countries would
be identified by a unique number carried in an implanted microchip or
tattoo.
The animals would have to be vaccinated at the age of three months or above,
undergo a blood test four months later to establish their immunity, and
spend at least six months in the approved country before entering the UK.
Pets would be allowed in for up to 12 months after the initial vaccination,
with frequent travellers requiring annual boosters. Vaccination records and
other health certificates would be carried in a passport relating to the
animal.
However, Mr Paul DeVile, president of the British Veterinary Association,
said yesterday that tattooing was difficult and microchip technology
insufficiently advanced, while standards of health certification differed
across the EU.
The committee also considered health controls on imported farm animals. It
concluded that the European single market had not resulted in the 'disease
time-bomb' some experts predicted.
