The world's highest chances of meeting a femme fatale are probably in
Switzerland. Not only does almost every able-bodied male citizen have a
rifle and ammunition at home against the dreaded day when the country is
invaded, but the 2,500-strong Swiss Women's Military Service are now allowed
to pack pistols.
The service's head Brigadier Eugenie Pollak says the weapons are purely for
self-defence. And although she knows of no occasion when one has been used
against an attacker, she can quote statistics to show that the pistols are
at least not proving a danger to the women soldiers themselves.
They have fired 81,000 shots in practice, without a single accident.
