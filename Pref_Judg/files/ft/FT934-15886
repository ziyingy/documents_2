FRENCH leaders have agreed a compromise on revisions to the constitution on
asylum to enable France to join EC partners in implementing the Schengen
free travel accord.
Both socialist President Francois Mitterrand and Mr Edouard Balladur, the
conservative prime minister, wanted a compromise to avoid having to put
constitutional changes to a referendum on an issue they feared would have
given racists a platform.
The asylum argument arose in August when the constitutional court ruled
against France's participation in an EC convention stating that an asylum
application refused in one EC country is deemed to be refused in the other
11 EC states.
The convention is designed to prevent refugees exploiting the removal of
border checks by 'shopping for asylum' around the Twelve. But France's
constitution, the court held, obliges it to consider all asylum demands.
The compromise revision, to be approved by parliament, would write into the
constitution provisions for France to reach asylum accords with its EC
partners, while giving the government the right, but no longer the
obligation, to examine asylum requests refused by other EC states.
