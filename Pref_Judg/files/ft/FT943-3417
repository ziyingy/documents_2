The enthusiastic response to Caradon's interim figures risks being
misinterpreted. The company has under-performed the market by some 25 per
cent this year and yesterday's 4 per cent bounce in its shares reflects the
lack of unpleasant surprises rather than any particular piece of good news.
Certainly Caradon has pushed up the margins at the Pillar businesses
acquired from RTZ last year, without drawing heavily on provisions. But
there must be some uncertainty over its ability to halt the decline in
margins in US security printing. The rise in UK base rates also raises
doubts about whether housing market turnover will be sufficient to generate
much increase in spending on the building materials in which it specialises.
If it does not, Caradon will still have the prospect of further enhancement
of margins at Pillar. That might justify a slightly higher rating than
comparable companies with which it is now level-pegging. Extra investment on
efficiency and restructuring is unlikely to prevent a further drop in
gearing, though, and that leads on to another uncertainty. At this rate,
Caradon could become ungeared in about 18 months. If organic growth is weak,
the temptation then will be to go for another large acquisition. The market
will not necessarily look kindly on that, despite the evident skill with
which Pillar is being absorbed.
