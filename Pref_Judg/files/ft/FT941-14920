The executive search profession was unimpressed by the first episode of the
BBC's Headhunters drama on Sunday night; TV reviewers panned it too. The
Daily Mail's said it was as 'thrilling as a tour round a processed pea
factory'. Apart from cameo appearances by Andrew Neil - editor of The Sunday
Times - and jazz singer George Melly, all the characters were a little
stiff.
But the story line - what happens when a headhunter poaches a team of
hot-shot entertainment lawyers from a fuddy-duddy law firm - is not utterly
daft.
After all, Russell Reynolds, one of the flashier international headhunters,
has just poached Roddy Gow, a former chief executive of Goddard Kay Rogers,
a smaller and more conservative firm which is still recovering from the
untimely death in an air accident of one of its founders David Kay.
Rather a case of kitsch, not art, imitating life.
