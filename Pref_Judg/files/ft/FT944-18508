The outer bow door of the Baltic ferry Estonia was ripped off in heavy
storms, allowing water to surge in and capsize the vessel in minutes,
investigators said last night.
The three-nation accident team said video footage of the stricken vessel,
lying in 80 metres of water, showed a 1m gap along the top edge of the
normally water-tight bow ramp. The opening had allowed water to rush into
the cavernous car deck, rapidly destabilising the ship and causing it to
sink.
More than 900 lives were lost when the Estonia went down last Wednesday in
stormy seas off Finland. The vessel had been sailing from the Estonian
capital Tallinn to Stockholm.
Mr Raimo Tiilikainen, head of the rescue operation, acknowledged yesterday
that there had been a 30-minute delay before news of the Estonia's distress
was passed from Finnish to Swedish rescue authorities. He promised a
separate inquiry into the delay.
Accident commission members, including representatives from Finland, Sweden
and Estonia, highlighted the failure of a bow door locking device. They said
they had seen video footage of broken hinges but had not been able to locate
the visor-style outer bow door itself.
'The water inflow through the partly dislodged forward ramp has been of
sufficient magnitude to result in a lack of stability and the capsizing of
the ferry. The water-tight bow ramp behind the visor is still in place
although there is a 1m gap along the top edge,' the investigators said.
The findings confirm eye-witness testimony and expert opinion that only an
event as dramatic as the tearing off of the bow door could have caused the
Estonia to capsize so quickly.
Finland's transport minister, Mr Ole Norrback, said yesterday he would
consider banning the use of bow doors on ferries.
In a pre-emptive move, Nordstrom &amp; Thulin, the Swedish joint owner of the
Estonia, said it would permanently seal the bow doors of the Vironia, a
replacement ferry which is due to start sailing between Stockholm and
Tallinn later this month. The company said all loading and unloading would
take place through the stern in an arrangement which it claimed would
'totally remove possible safety risks' at the front of the ship.
Meanwhile, Swedish inspectors yesterday stopped a ferry sailing from Sweden
to Denmark after discovering serious faults in the bow section. The Lion
Prince, operated by Lion Ferry, a Stena Line subsidiary, was taken out of
service before it sailed from Varberg, south of Gothenburg, to Grenaa on the
Jutland peninsula.
