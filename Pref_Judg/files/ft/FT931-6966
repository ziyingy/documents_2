BRITISH Gas saw profits in its core UK business decline by Pounds 276m in
1992 as a result of warmer weather, loss of market share and lower prices
for the supply of household gas. But this was partly offset by an increase
in earnings from the company's overseas divisions.
On 12 months' turnover of Pounds 10.25bn (Pounds 10.49bn) group pre-tax
profits came out at Pounds 1.05bn, after exceptional charges of Pounds 320m,
compared with Pounds 1.71bn.
Mr Philip Rogerson, British Gas's director of finance, pointed to a strong
improvement in fourth quarter profits at the exploration and production
division, where income doubled from Pounds 60m to Pounds 128m, following the
increase in production at its South Morecambe bay field in the North Sea.
For the full year, exploration and production, where most revenues come from
overseas, increased slightly to Pounds 224m compared with Pounds 221m.
The overseas gas supply business saw a rise in profits for the year to
Pounds 137m, against Pounds 125m, following an increase in sales volumes
abroad and a drop in the purchase price of gas. The rise came mainly in the
fourth quarter, which accounted for Pounds 42m (Pounds 33m).
Mr Robert Evans, chairman, said the overseas divisions provided a 'welcome
contribution,' to profits, accounting for roughly 25 per cent of the total.
He hoped the two divisions would provide 60 per cent of profits by the end
of the decade.
The profits of the UK gas business fell from Pounds 1.5bn to Pounds 1.2bn
last year. Factors behind the decline were the warmer weather, which
accounted for Pounds 140m of the drop; the squeeze on prices as a result of
the tough new formula imposed by the regulator, leading to a fall of Pounds
50m; and the loss of market share in the industrial market, taking out
Pounds 70m.
Non-gas costs also increased and pipeline revenues improved.
In the final quarter of 1992, the UK gas business showed a roughly stable
profit of Pounds 626m, compared with Pounds 636m.
Earnings per share were 15.8p for the full year, compared with 27.3p. In the
final quarter earnings per share were 5.4p (11.3p).
The company declared a final dividend of 7.8p, which made a total for the
year of 14.2p - a rise of some 6 per cent from 10.25p for the previous 12
months.
Mr Rogerson said: 'The policy of increasing the dividend in real terms and
the ability to maintain it depends to a significant degree on the outcome of
the MMC inquiry.' British Gas is currently under review by the Monopolies
and Mergers Commission.
The company had a net cash outflow of Pounds 1.5bn, slightly higher than
analysts had forecast. This was chiefly because of heavier tax and dividend
payments during the 12 months after changing the reporting period from the
tax year to the calendar year.
British Gas's level of gearing rose to 33 per cent from 25 per cent.
