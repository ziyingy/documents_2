British Telecommunications operators have voted to strike against proposals
to reduce allowances for working unsocial hours.
The vote for action was 85 per cent on a 68 per cent turnout among the 9,078
operators. The executive council of the UCW communications union meets today
to discuss the implications of the vote.
