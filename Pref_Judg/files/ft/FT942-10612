Foreign companies can execute documents in the UK without the need to apply
a common seal, following the introduction by the UK government of new
regulations under the 1989 Companies Act. This will mean anyone eligible to
sign documents under the foreign company's own domestic law will also be
eligible to sign them under British law.
