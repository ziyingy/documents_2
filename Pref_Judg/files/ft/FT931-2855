PROFIT-TAKING hit US equity prices yesterday afternoon, sending stocks
broadly lower in late trading, writes Karen Zagor in New York.
The Dow Jones Industrial Average was finally down 16.21 at 3,426.74. The
Standard &amp; Poor's 500 lost 3.06 at 448.31 and the Nasdaq composite fell 8.07
to 687.40. Trading volume on the New York SE amounted to 241.3m shares, and
declines led rises by 1,161 to 719.
Late profit-taking contributed to the broadly based decline, but there was
an underlying softness to the market reflecting some concern about
inflation, following reports that the core consumer price index rose by 0.5
per cent in February, above the anticipated 0.3 per cent. Including the
mercurial food and energy components, the index was 0.3 per cent higher for
February.
Micron Technologies plunged Dollars 4 to Dollars 23 7/8 after the Commerce
Department said it would subject South Korean competitors to surprisingly
light tariffs. Dynamic random access memory chips, known as D-RAMs, made by
South Korean companies, will be subject to duties of 0.74 per cent to 7.19
per cent. The industry had expected duties of at least 10 per cent.
The ruling also hurt shares in Texas Instruments, which dropped Dollars 2
3/4 to Dollars 59 5/8 .

controls on pharmaceuticals prices, and drug company stocks were among the

Dollars 17 after signing an agreement to buy Melville's Chess King division.
A bout of profit-taking pushed down casino and gambling-related issues after
strong gains in recent weeks. The sector was also hurt by vague speculation
that congress might try to propose a moratorium on Native American gambling
compacts with states. Arizona, and some other states, have recently tried to
restrict gambling. President Riverboat Casinos fell Dollars 3 7/8 to Dollars
52 7/8 and Promus Dollars 3 7/8 to Dollars 68 5/8 .
Carnival Cruise firmed Dollars  3/8 to Dollars 38 1/4 after stating that it
had agreed to sell one of its cruise ships to a new company to be formed by
three companies, including Carnival. Each of the three cruise lines, which
include Miami-based Dolphin Cruise Line and Epirotiki Lines, will have an
equal stake in the new company.
