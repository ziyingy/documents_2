PLANS TO phase out the dumping at sea of sewage sludge and industrial waste
are on course Mr John Gummer, the agriculture minister, last night told
delegates at the opening of a meeting of the London Dumping Convention.
Mr Gummer said the sewage ban would 'give the environment the benefit of the
doubt'.
He added: 'This applies especially to the sea, which is a common inheritance
of all nations.
'In the UK, major investments are being made to develop land-based
alternatives to sea dumping of industrial wastes and of sewage sludge.
'This will enable us to phase out our last remaining licences for sea
dumping of industrial wastes by early next year and to cease sea dumping of
sewage sludge by 1998.'
The London Dumping Convention was set up in 1972 to curb the disposal of
harmful wastes in the oceans.
