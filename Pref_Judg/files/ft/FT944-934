After years of delay caused by worries about crime and waves of refugees,
border controls within Europe will be eliminated next March 26 - at least in
seven of the 12 members of the European Union. The accord 'is a historic
step on the way to full freedom of movement in all Europe and means an
increase in security for our citizens', Mr Bernd Schmidbauer, the German
minister responsible for European affairs, said yesterday in Bonn. Ministers
from the participating countries met in Bonn to complete the accord, which
means that inner-European border controls, which already have partly
disappeared, will fall away completely. It applies from the Mediterranean to
the North Sea. The participants are Portugal, Spain, France, Germany,
Luxembourg, Belgium and the Netherlands. Italy and Greece have said they
will join when they overcome technical problems. The only EU members not in
the pact are Britain, Ireland and Denmark. Austria, one of three countries
joining the EU in 1995, is expected to accept the elimination of border
controls with EU countries, but the others, Sweden and Finland, will not.
