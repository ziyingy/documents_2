Sir, The Dean of Salisbury (Fashion, October 31) does not give us his views
on women priests, but it is obvious that to him women are creatures of
fantasy who do not even belong to the same species ('these loud confident
people in their black ties and these loud confident women in their
extraordinary dresses').
If clerical outfitters succumb to the vapours at the prospect of dressing
these delicious beings, with their glorious contours, auburn curls etc,
their military or legal counterparts, who have had longer to get used to
them, should be able to bring them round soon enough with the cold water of
realism.
