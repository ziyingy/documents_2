SHARE prices rose slightly yesterday, as denials by a former prime minister
regarding his involvement in an alleged bribery scandal relieved the market,
writes Emiko Terazono in Tokyo.
The Nikkei average recovered 52.31 at 21,025.55, after a day's low of
20,742.53 and high of 21,093.90. Volume picked up to 160m shares from 130m
in trading dominated by arbitrage-related activity.
In spite of the improvement in the Nikkei, declines led advances by 507 to
370 with 210 issues unchanged. The Topix index of all first section stocks
ended 0.85 easier at 1,535.97, and in London the ISE/Nikkei 50 index lost
0.77 to 1,172.17.
The market focused on the testimony by Mr Zenko Suzuki, the former prime
minister, before the lower house budget committee. Mr Suzuki denied
allegations that he had played an active role in connection with an alleged
bribery scandal involving Kyowa, the bankrupt steel frame builder and
property developer.
The futures market gained strength in the afternoon after the parliamentary
hearing.
Traders said there were lingering hopes of an early cut in the discount
rate. Mr Kozo Watanabe, minister of international trade and industry, called
for a discount rate reduction. 'The market now looks to the Bank of Japan's
quarterly survey of business sentiment,' commented Mr Shigeru Akiba of UBS
Phillips &amp; Drew.
Brokerage stocks fell on reports that securities companies were helping
investors to window dress their accounts by selling loss-carrying
investments to other clients.
The chairman and vice-president of Cosmo Securities, a second-tier brokerage
house, resigned after Cosmo announced an out-of-court settlement with
Skylark, a restaurant chain, which claimed that it had incurred losses due
to Cosmo's trading practices. Cosmo was untraded due to a lack of buyers and
closed at an offered price of Y540, down Y30, and Daiwa Securities fell Y28
to Y970.
Nippon Telegraph and Telephone rose Y7,000 to Y708,000 on comments by a
finance ministry official in favour of a stock split. An increase in the
stock's liquidity is likely to make it more attractive.
High-technology issues suffered losses on earnings worries. Fujitsu declined
Y6 to Y715 and Matsushita Electric Industrial dipped Y10 to Y1,340. Oki
Electric Industry initially fell after reports that its non-consolidated
pre-tax profit will fall 95 per cent to Y1bn, but late bargain hunting left
the issue a net Y5 up at Y514.
In Osaka, the OSE average slipped 92.07 to 22,581.90 in volume of 192.5m
shares. Heavy window dressing by companies and financial institutions
wishing to realise profits ahead of the March fiscal year-end pushed up
activity.
