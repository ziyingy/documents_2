MECKLENBURG-West Pomerania, the most rural and thinly populated of the new
east German Lander (states), is seeking foreign private investment in the
water, sewage, housing and tourist industries, said Mr Berndt Seite, its
prime minister, Peter Norman writes.
Visiting the UK, Mr Seite said seven British companies were interested in
investing in the state, including companies in the building material and
food sectors. He said it could take 20 years before the state caught up with
western Germany's standard of living. But it could offer a wide range of
financial inducements to potential investors and had good contacts with
industry in former communist countries.
