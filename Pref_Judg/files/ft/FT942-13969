The international Human Genome Project - aimed at mapping and identifying
the estimated 100,000 human genes - is stimulating rapid advances in
laboratory automation. The latest comes from a collaboration between the
Imperial Cancer Research Fund, a London-based charity, and two UK companies:
Linear Drives of Rayleigh, Essex, and Genetix of Christchurch, Dorset.
The three partners have developed a robotic system to help scientists
produce the huge numbers of cloned cells required for genetics research.
The system locates clone colonies growing on culture plates with a CCD
camera. It then 'picks' healthy-looking colonies with a block of 96
spring-loaded pins and moves the cells to dishes for further growth and
analysis.
