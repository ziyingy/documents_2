SPENDING BY the offshore oil industry in the UK sector of the North Sea is
expected to fall only modestly in during the next four years. This is in
spite of the fact that the UK continental shelf is now a mature area for oil
and gas production.
Between this year and 1997 annual spending on existing and new fields should
fall by less than Pounds 1bn from this year's level of Pounds 8.5bn, says
Scottish Enterprise, the development body, which yesterday published its
biennial forecasts for UK and worldwide petroleum activity.
The forecasts contrast with those Scottish Enterprise made in 1991, which
suggested a rather steeper decline in spending on exploration, development
and operations from an all-time peak in 1991. In that year spending in the
UK continental shelf was Pounds 9.3bn.
The continued high level of development spending, measured in 1993 prices,
follows the record levels of exploration and appraisal reached in 1990, when
214 wells were drilled.
Only 137 exploration and appraisal wells were started last year and Scottish
Enterprise does not expect more than 105 to be drilled each year up to 1997.
The study suggests this is partly due to the removal in the March Budget of
petroleum revenue tax relief for exploration and appraisal work.
About 41 new oil or gas fields are expected to come on stream in the
northern North Sea and 29 in the southern sector between 1993 and 1997.
