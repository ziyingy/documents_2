India yesterday denied it had received 12.5 tonnes of heavy water that
Norway said was diverted from a 1986 shipment it sold to Romania, AP-DJ

heavy water was legally imported only from the Soviet Union and was used in
atomic power reactors under international safeguards. 'The question of
smuggling of heavy water does not arise.'
