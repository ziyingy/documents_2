A CONTRACT won in April by a consortium led by ABB Asea Brown Boveri, the
Swedish-Swiss power engineering group, to build the Shaijiao C coal-fired
power plant in Guangdong province of China has been extended to include an
expansion from the originally planned 1,310MW capacity to 1,980MW.
The value of the enlarged contract is to rise from an amount in excess of
Dollars 1bn (Pounds 500m) to over Dollars 1.4bn, and the share of ABB's US
subsidiary, ABB Combustion Engineering Systems, rises from Dollars 270m to
