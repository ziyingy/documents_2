The Court of Session, Scotland's supreme civil court, is to try to speed up
its handling of commercial cases, which has been heavily criticised by
companies for its slowness.
Lord Hope, the Lord President, who is the senior judge in Scotland's legal
system, yesterday nominated Lord Penrose, one of the 27 judges of the Court
of Session, to concentrate purely on commercial cases. Two other judges,
Lord Cullen and Lord Coulsfield, will supplement him.
Lord Hope said there was great reluctance among Scottish companies to bring
commercial litigation in the Court of Session. They considered it
time-consuming and found the court lacking in expertise. He wanted them to
stop feeling that they had to take their civil actions to England, 'which
would be a great misfortune'.
Although much Scottish law differs from English law, most of the law
governing commercial matters applies to the whole of the UK. The judges of
the Court of Session administer both civil and criminal cases, and
commercial cases are often delayed because the judge has to hear criminal
cases.
Under the new system, which comes into effect this month, commercial
litigants will be able to opt for a faster procedure. The same judge will
handle all stages of a case and will take an active role in pushing cases
forward rather than allowing the parties involved to set the pace.
The summons needed to start a commercial action will be expected to be short
and non-technical, and to identify the issue which the litigant wishes to
have resolved.
When the case comes to the main hearing in court, parties to the action
should expect the judge to be familiar with the documents and not need to be
taken through them stage by stage.
