Texaco, the US energy group, faces a close vote tomorrow in its attempt to
buy out the minority shareholders in its 78 per cent-owned Canadian
subsidiary.
The largest minority shareholder, Canadian 88 Energy, yesterday raised the
value of its own counter offer for the company, Texaco Canada Petroleum. The
independent exploration and production company also reaffirmed it would
reject the Texaco offer.
Mr Greg Noval, president of Canadian 88, said Texaco needed the support of
holders of at least half the remaining 22 per cent before it could mount a
compulsory buy-out of all the shares. On that basis, Canadian 88, which in
the last two weeks has built its stake in Texaco Canada to 9.8 per cent,
requires only a few other shareholders to thwart the US group's plans.
Texaco's offer of CDollars 1.40 a share for the 22 per cent of the Canadian
company it does not already own was countered by a CDollars 1.60-a-share
offer from Canadian 88. Yesterday, the Canadian independent, with market
capitalisation of CDollars 125m (USDollars 91.4m), lifted its offer to
CDollars 1.65 a share, valuing Texaco Canada at CDollars 208m.
Mr Noval said the bid was a genuine attempt to acquire the company, and not
simply a move to force Texaco to increase its own offer.
The dispute centres on the value of Texaco Canada's assets, which include an
interest in a partnership which owns gas assets in British Columbia and
direct ownership of oil reserves in Alberta.
