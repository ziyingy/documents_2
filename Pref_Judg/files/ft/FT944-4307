Today's European Council summit in Essen ought to be cause for celebration
but risks turning into a wake.
Essen was at first billed as a defining moment in the German-led strategy to
build a wider European Union incorporating the former communist countries of
central and eastern Europe. To the dismay of Chancellor Helmut Kohl,
however, the two-day summit seems certain to be haunted by Bosnia.
All 12 EU leaders present, and Mr Jacques Delors, the outgoing president of
the European Commission and potential candidate for president of France,
recognise the corrosive effects of the Bosnian conflict as it poisons
relations within the Atlantic alliance and with Russia.
The question is whether the rift between the US and Europe over strategy
toward the Balkans will spread to the European Union, which next year takes
in Sweden, Austria and Finland. France and the UK are acutely aware of
German public opinion in favour of US calls to lift the UN arms embargo
against the warring parties, which would help the Bosnian Moslem government.
Yet lifting the embargo is anathema. It would trigger withdrawal of the
23,000-strong UN peacekeeping force, to which France and the UK have
contributed generously, and deepen the rift in Nato.
Mr Kohl will therefore do his utmost to prevent a split. He knows that it
would rekindle fears of France, Germany and the UK going their separate ways
in the Balkans - a repeat of history at the end of the 19th century and,
briefly, in December 1991 when Germany put pressure on its reluctant EU
partners to recognise its favoured states Croatia and Slovenia.
Even if Mr Kohl succeeds in papering over differences, he will not be able
to conceal the impotence of the EU in the face of a crisis in its own
backyard or its apparent indifference to the destruction of a multi-ethnic
state recognised by the international community.
'You cannot underestimate the psychological damage caused by Bosnia,
particularly on European public opinion,' says a Commission official.
The same debilitating effect is evident in the item second on the Essen
agenda - unemployment. True, the European economy is on the mend; but it is
a jobless recovery. Europe still has about 18m people out of work, and there
is little prospect of shortening the dole queues by much. 'The EU has failed
to answer the most fundamental question: What's in it for me?' says one
Commission official.
Today in Essen, Mr Delors will again spell out the competitive challenge
posed by the US and Asia. He will urge fresh measures to create jobs.
One idea is the multi-billion-dollar trans-European rail, road and
telecommunications networks; others are the new 'information highway' and a
more imaginative approach to labour markets.
The third item on the agenda is eastern Europe, and it remains the issue on
which the success of the summit is likely to be judged. In the run-up to the
Essen meeting, much has been made of Mr Kohl's hesitation about inviting the
leaders of Poland, Hungary, the Czech republic, Slovakia, Bulgaria and
Romania, which all hope to join the Union.
Doubts grew after the German presidency of the EU soft-pedalled on trade
liberalisation measures and avoided a commitment to reform of the structural
funds and the common agricultural policy, both of which are necessary if the
costs of eastward enlargement are not to be prohibitive.
Sir Leon Brittan, chief EU trade negotiator, rejected much of the criticism
this week. He singled out a planned blueprint for EU accession setting out
steps for adapting laws, state aid, norms and standards to allow the six
eastern European states to adjust progressively to the single European
market.
German officials agree that the package for eastern Europe reaches the
limits of what other countries - notably the Franco-Spanish-led 'Club Med'
bloc - would tolerate.
France underlined the point by insisting that EU funds for eastern Europe
over the next five years would have to be matched with more money for the
Mediterranean, specifically North Africa.
This linkage between eastern Europe and the Mediterranean is new. Perhaps
France and Germany are striking a sensible bargain for joint EU action to
counter instability on the EU's periphery; but France may also be seeking to
counter the eastward pull of a unified Germany with its own shift to the
south.
This would mark a division of Europe into old-style spheres of influence, an
arrangement which falls short of the proclaimed European Union created by
the Maastricht treaty.
But, as Mr Delors is likely to point out to the leaders over dinner tonight,
the Union is not living up to its name: its common security and foreign
policy is a sham; and the loose inter-governmental co-operation supposed to
deal with justice and home affairs has failed to produce a single
achievement in the past 12 months.
The Commission blames British and Spanish blocking tactics, but also singles
out unyielding French opposition to diluting the power of its own national
police forces, led by Mr Charles Pasqua, the right-wing interior minister.
The Euro-activists, whose champion is Chancellor Kohl, believe they have the
answer: a faster route to political and economic union, buttressed by
greater powers to the European Parliament and the European Commission, led
by an inner core of integrationist-minded EU states. Their target date for
action is the inter-governmental conference of 1996 to review the Maastricht
treaty.
Those of a more passive persuasion, particularly UK prime minister Mr John
Major, will resist. Their political survival depends on stopping a Great
Leap Forward in Europe. Still, as Mr Major disclosed this week, there may be
contingency plans for referendums on Maastricht 2, specifically any move to
join a single European currency.
The struggle between these two opposing camps will be one of the sub-texts
of the Essen summit. Its outcome will have a decisive influence on how the
EU resolves the official item on today's summit agenda: the integration of
western and eastern Europe.
