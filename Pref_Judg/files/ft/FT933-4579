WITH ALL its three companies reporting substantial profits increases,
Telemetrix, the electronics and information systems company, saw pre-tax
profits jump to Pounds 7.93m in the six months to June 30, though last
time's Pounds 673,000 was struck after exceptional provisions of Pounds
2.93m.
Group turnover advanced to Pounds 61.5m (Pounds 46.8m).
Operating profits more than doubled to Pounds 7.95m (Pounds 3.88m), with
continuing operations contributing Pounds 8.13m (Pounds 4.22m).
This was largely thanks to GTI Corporation, the data communications
subsidiary which was 60.6 per cent owned by Telemetrix during the period.
It made operating profits of Dollars 9.8m (with an exchange rate of Dollars
1.50/Pounds 1), against Dollars 5.7m (Dollars 1.80/Pounds 1) last time.
Since June 30 GTI has lifted its holding in Valor, its networks components
arm, a further 6.4 per cent to 97.2 per cent for Dollars 10.5m in promissory
notes, since redeemed by a public offering of 400,000 common shares in GTI.
This reduced Telemetrix' holding in GTI to 58.3 per cent, though Mr Curtis
said that his company's stake in Valor rose from 55 to 56.7 per cent with no
outlay of cash.
Valor's sales, mainly in the US, grew 61 per cent to Dollars 45.1m,
accounting for some 70 per cent of GTI's Dollars 64.2m (Dollars 49.6m) total
sales, though Mr Curtis acknowledged that this rate of growth in Valor's
local area network business could not continue.
Zetex, the UK manufacturer of specialist semi-conductors, 70 per cent of
which are sold outside the UK, raised profits to Pounds 1.25m (Pounds
809,000) on turnover of Pounds 9.37m (Pounds 7.02m). Shorn of its
defence-related operations, sales at Trend, the telecommunications test
equipment maker, fell to Pounds 6.76m (Pounds 7.46m), but operating profits
rose to Pounds 680,000 compared with Pounds 247,000.
Further growth in its current markets would be sufficient, said Mr Tim
Curtis, chief executive, but the group was looking for acquisitions to
broaden its product range or to move into a new technology.
It currently has Pounds 6.6m cash.
Earnings per share emerged at 3.8p (losses 1.6p).
