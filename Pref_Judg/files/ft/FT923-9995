This is the Californian Tree Poppy, a semi-shrubby perennial with stiff,
5ft-6ft stems, some of which might survive the winter, but others are likely
to be killed to ground level except in mild places. Stems and leaves are
grey-green; the sweetly scented flowers, which are large and poppy-like, are
pure white with a big central boss of golden stamens. This is a very
beautiful plant, which thrives in warm, sunny places and fertile, porous
soils. It is difficult to transplant and should be obtained in pots, from
which it can be planted out without root disturbance.
