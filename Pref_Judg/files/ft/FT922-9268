MR KRAAI van Niekerk, the South African agriculture minister, yesterday
announced a R3.8bn rand (Pounds 740m) drought aid package, which he called
the most significant rescue bid ever for the country's farmers.
'These measures are being established in order to relieve the effects of the
most serious drought yet experienced in South Africa this century,' he said.
The four-year package includes R1bn already announced for drought relief in
the national budget in March.
'Without intervention by the state, serious disruption of the South African
economy can take place,' Mr van Niekerk said.
The economy is gripped by its longest recession since the second world war,
sapped by years of sanctions and labouring under weak world prices for the
country's main export, gold.
Because of widespread crop failure, South Africa, normally a leading
exporter of maize, is seeking to import 5m tonnes.
