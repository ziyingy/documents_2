AMERICAN Cyanamid, the US pharmaceuticals and specialty chemicals group, is
facing a probe by US government authorities over allegations that false data
was submitted to the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) for several new
animal drug applications.
Dozens of American Cyanamid's veterinary drug applications have been halted
while the FDA checks the research data. The Justice Department is
investigating an American Cyanamid employee, believed to have altered the
research results, and the FDA is exploring if Cyanamid's management knew of
any data falsification. The news spurred trading in American Cyanamid's
shares, which fell Dollars 1 5/8 to Dollars 58 7/8 at close of trading on
the New York Stock Exchange.
Mr Leonard Bogner, an analyst at Prudential Securities, said most of the
suspended new product applications were linked to Cyanamid's Cygro chicken
feed supplement which had estimated US annual sales of only Dollars 2m
before it was withdrawn in 1990. Cyanamid's Cydectin and BST products were
not included in the list, and most analysts did not expect its human
healthcare products to encounter any regulatory problems. The FDA said
yesterday the safety of Cyanamid's products was not in question, although
the effectiveness of the Cygro products is being investigated.
The company said it was reviewing internal controls in the animal health
area 'to assure that applicable regulatory requirements are followed and
that scientific data meets the highest possible standards'.
The FDA's ability to monitor scientific data has been questioned by the
General Accounting Office, the investigative arm of Congress. A GAO study,
said weaknesses in the FDA's two main controls over data submissions might
impede its ability to detect fraud in animal drug data.
