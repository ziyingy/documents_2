Argentina's charm offensive against the Falkland Islands gathers pace. Guido
di Tella, the urbane Argentine foreign minister is to be guest of honour -
the less generous might say sitting target - on one of the BBC World
Service's more sensitive shows, Calling the Falklands.
The one-hour programme will go out live on June 18 and the Beeb promises
that neither questions nor responses will be edited. Whose idea was it?
'That's a bit hazy,' says a member of the BBC production staff. But di Tella
clearly has an agenda; he recently sent the Falklanders a letter telling
them how nice the Argentines really are.
On that occasion they politely told him to sling his hook. On air, they may
have some fruitier comments. But di Tella, a former Oxford don, is cooler
than a cucumber.
