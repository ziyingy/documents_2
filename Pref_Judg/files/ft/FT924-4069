FIREFIGHTERS in the northern Spanish port of La Coruna were struggling
yesterday to contain a blaze on the Greek-registered tanker Aegean Sea which
ran aground entering the harbour yesterday morning, spilling thousands of
tonnes of crude oil into the sea from its shattered hull, Peter Bruce
reports from Madrid.
The tanker, whose captain has been held for questioning, was carrying 80,000
tonnes of North Sea crude. It grounded in bad weather while approaching a
refinery owned by the Repsol oil company. All 29 crew were taken off the
vessel, which was rocked by large explosions, sending a pall of smoke over
the city (pictured left). It was unclear how many of the nine segregated
storage tanks have been ruptured. Ecologists said they feared the spillage
would cause extensive damage to the area.
