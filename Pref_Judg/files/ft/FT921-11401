CUSTOMS AND EXCISE has received Pounds 614,000 seized from drug smugglers -
its first reward for co-operation on international operations to reduce
trafficking.
Most of the money comes from joint activities with the US, which allows drug
smugglers' assets to be distributed to agencies involved in catching them.
In the UK, money goes to the Home Office Seized Assets Fund.
