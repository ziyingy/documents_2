INDUSTRY cannot afford the Pounds 13bn cost of sick days off work, Mrs
Virginia Bottomley, health secretary, warned yesterday.
Alcohol, smoking-related diseases and mental illness were mainly
responsible, she told a Confederation of British Industry conference.
Mrs Bottomley said: 'Avoidable ill-health is a burden the country cannot
afford.
'In 1979 strikes cost our country 29m lost working days. Today we lose twice
that through alcohol and tobacco-related illness every year.'
