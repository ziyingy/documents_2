SURPLUS SUGAR stocks in Pakistan are set to eliminate the country's need to
import sugar, although the potential for export remains unclear.
Pakistan's total production is expected to hit 2.6m tonnes by the end of the
1992-93 fiscal year, up from 2.3m tonnes in 1991-92. Government officials
estimate that private traders are holding 132,000 tonnes of stocks, and that
is expected to start rising next month as the new production season begins
at sugar mills.
The rise in sugar production has partly resulted from an increase in the
number of sugar mills as well as improvements in the recovery rate of sugar
cane and beet. Pakistan started with 2 sugar mills with a daily sugar cane
crushing capacity of 1,500 tonnes at the time of its independence in 1947;
today there are 54, with an aggregate capacity of 175,000 tonnes.
The rise in production has allowed cuts in sugar imports. In June this year,
imports of white refined sugar fell to just 538 tonnes, down from 3,480
tonnes in May. Last year, 36,819 tonnes was imported in June, following
48,290 tonnes in May.
However, the country's sugar export potential remains unclear. With
countries such as Brazil and Cuba having lower costs of production,
Pakistani sugar might not be able to compete, said one senior official.
Up to 100,000 tonnes of sugar is estimated to be smuggled annually to
neighbouring Iran and Afghanistan. That has made it difficult to assess if a
surplus will be left after meeting domestic consumption, including
smuggling, in order to set aside large quantities for export. However,
Pakistan will at least save valuable foreign exchange by meeting its sugar
requirements domestically. Last year Dollars 36.8m was spent on importing
sugar, which was down from Dollars 160.5m, a year earlier.
