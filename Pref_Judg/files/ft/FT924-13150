IM SKAUGEN, one of Norway's largest shipowners, fell to a loss of NKr338m
(Dollars 56.71m) in the eight months to August, from a profit of NKr114m in
the same period last year.
The group has been undergoing a sweeping restructuring which has resulted in
a NKr2.229bn consolidation of the balance sheet, to NKr1.752bn.
Freight income on a time-charter basis fell to NKr774m from NKr1.319bn due
to a reduction in the size of the fleet.
The group suffered a NKr61m loss on sales of ships compared with a NKr234m
gain last year, but net financial costs were reduced by half to NKr41m.
