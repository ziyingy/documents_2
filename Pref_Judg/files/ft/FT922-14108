TORY-held Dover, Britain's gateway to the rest of Europe, will open Labour's
door to government tomorrow if Mr Colin Bartholomew has his way.
Mr Bartholomew and Mr Joe Nicholas, two veteran seamen cooks laid off by
Sealink last year, have started up a coffee shop in Dover's city centre.
'It's time for a change. It's certainly changed us,' said Mr Bartholomew
declaring his intention to vote Labour.
Mr Gwyn Prosser, the Labour candidate - himself an ex-Sealink officer
engineer who took voluntary redundancy last autumn - was at the shop's
opening this week. If he upsets the Conservative incumbent, Mr David Shaw,
defending a 6,541 majority, Mr Prosser may pop by again for a slice of
celebratory cheesecake.
The cooks' transition from ship to shore symbolises the transformation
confronting Dover as it grapples with the prospect of large job losses in
port-related activities in the next few years. The opening of the Channel
tunnel in nearby Folkestone in 1993-94 threatens to choke off Dover's
livelihood.
Dover Council officials estimate that 5,000 further jobs will go by 1995,
with staff reductions on the ferries, the ending of tunnel construction
work, and job losses among freight forwarders as the liberalised single
European market comes into force.
Mr Shaw said he was confident of holding on in tomorrow's seven-way fight.
Latest canvassing returns gave him 44 per cent across this highly disparate
constituency, down only two per cent from last time, he said - pouring scorn
on recent telephone polls by local newspapers putting Labour well ahead.
Mr Prosser says that there is sufficient anger in the town over rising
unemployment that he will score a majority of at least 3,000. He underlines
the need to concentrate resources on bringing in new industrial investment,
and even talks of Dover applying for regional aid. Whoever wins, Dover's
future will not be plain sailing.
