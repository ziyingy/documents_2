Good news for whales. A group of islands in the Caribbean is fighting about
the creation of a whale sanctuary in Antarctica. Their input could tip the
balance at this week's International Whaling Commission meeting in Mexico.
Whales are spotted but rarely in these waters - and caught still more
infrequently. But Dominica and its neighbours, Grenada, St Lucia and St
Vincent, have emerged as important players in global whale politics. Japan,
which wants commercial whaling to continue, has been jolly generous to the
islands with the result that they have happily toed its line.
However, environmental activists have been working hard to keep tourists
from visiting the Windwards and the campaign is starting to bite. Last week
Dominica broke ranks and said it would support the sanctuary idea. St Lucia
might follow.
But the Vincentians are standing firm. They obviously just won't risk
missing that very occasional whale that swims by.
