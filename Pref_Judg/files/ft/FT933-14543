THE number of people referred by police to the Crown Prosecution Service in
England and Wales has fallen and fewer cases are coming to court in spite of
record levels of crime, the CPS annual report said yesterday.
The report said that in 1992-93 police referred 1.5m cases to the CPS -
83,000 fewer than in 1990-91 and 41,000 fewer than 1991-92.
