IMMIGRATION officials in California fear that thousands of illegal Chinese
emigrants may be on board ships headed for the west coast of the US,
following the apprehension of about 500 Chinese landing along the coast over
the past two weeks.
Two trawlers, each carrying a human cargo of about 150 Chinese immigrants
packed into the holds, were seized earlier this week as they landed at
fishing harbours near Monterey and San Francisco. The coastal vessels are
believed to have picked up their passengers five days earlier from off-shore
'mother ships' which crossed the Pacific.
Last month, in an even more brazen attempt to smuggle people into the US,
the Pai Sheng, a Chinese freighter, sailed under the Golden Gate Bridge
right into San Francisco Bay to drop off about 270 passengers at a disused
city pier. Most were detained after a chase by police and immigration agents
through city parks and streets.
These incidents are further evidence of what US authorities say is a
large-scale smuggling operation with suspected links to Asian organised
crime rings in the US and Hong Kong.
The immigrants, most of them men in their 20s, pay fees of between Dollars
20,000 (Pounds 13,000) and Dollars 40,000 for their passage to the US,
according to investigators. They scrape together about Dollars 1,000,
typically borrowed from relatives, to board the ships, and are then indebted
for the balance of their 'fare'.
Most of the illegal immigrants set off from the coastal Chinese provinces of
Fujian and Guangdong. Many, however, come from China's hinterland where
people feel they are being left behind by the economic boom in more
prosperous areas of the country. A widening economic gap between country and
city is contributing to the desperation of many young Chinese.
Although they come to the US seeking jobs and economic prosperity, the
immigrants instead become slaves to their smugglers and many resort to crime
to pay off their debts, according to the Federal Bureau of Investigation.
'They are selling their souls. What are these people going to do to pay off
the smugglers? ' asks Richard Held, a FBI Special Agent in San Francisco.
'Does that mean moving heroin or cocaine? That is a distinct possibility.'
The recent influx has raised suspicions in the US of complicity by the
Chinese government in the human trafficking. But in Beijing officials deny
'turning a blind eye' to illegal emigration. 'The Chinese government has all
along been opposed to illegal emigration and has adopted a series of
measures to stop it,' said Mr Wu Jianmin, the Chinese foreign ministry
spokesman.
Mr Wu insisted that Chinese security organisations had 'intensified their
efforts' to stop illegal organisations trafficking in immigrants.
However, some of the immigrants landing in San Francisco this week spoke of
paying additional fees to bribe Chinese government officials to let them
leave the country, according to US investigators.
With millions of dollars being extorted from the passengers of the Chinese
smuggling ships, it seems unlikely that the practice will end soon. So far
this year, the US Coast Guard has detained over 1,600 illegal Chinese
immigrants, more than twice the number in 1992.
The rising numbers could, however, reflect a change of route, rather than a
growing volume of illegal immigrants. US investigators speculate that the
smugglers are now cutting out 'middle men' in other countries and attempting
to maximise their profits by landing their passengers directly on US shores.
Chinese officials charge that the willingness of some countries (including
the US) to grant 'political asylum' to Chinese emigrants is encouraging
human smuggling.
Indeed, US immigration lawyers representing some of the passengers of the
Pai Sheng say that they will seek asylum and note that the judicial process
may take as long as 10 years, giving their clients time to seek legal US
residency.
