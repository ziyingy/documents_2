Jim Howe, the doctor who treated Hillsborough coma victim Tony Bland,
dismissed as 'foolish' a former priest's threat to launch a private
prosecution against him for murder. Mr Bland died in a West Yorkshire
hospital on Wednesday after a court ruled that his life support systems
could be switched off.
