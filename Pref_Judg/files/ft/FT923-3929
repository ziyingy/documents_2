A SENIOR United Nations official said yesterday that the creation of an open
internal market in the European Community could hamper the war on drug
trafficking, Reuter reports from Rome.
'The liberalisation that we are all hoping for has its negative aspects. One
of these aspects is crime,' said Mr Giorgio Giacomelli, head of the UN's
anti-drug programme. 'In an integrated Europe, we need to create new
safeguards to keep crime under control,' Mr Giacomelli added.
Rotterdam city council said yesterday that it may start giving free heroin
to drug addicts in an experiment to cut drug-related crime in the Dutch
city, Reuter reports.
