THIS section summarises the tax and national insurance proposals in the
Budget.
The effect of these changes on government revenues is set out in the table
below.
INLAND REVENUE
Income tax: There will be no change to income tax allowances or the income
limit for age-related allowances for 1993-94.
The 20 per cent tax band will be widened from Pounds 2,000 to Pounds 2,500
for 1993-94, and by a further Pounds 500 to Pounds 3,000 for 1994-95. The
basic rate limit is unchanged at Pounds 23,700.
From 6 April 1994 tax relief for the married couple's allowance, and
allowances linked to it, will be restricted to 20 per cent. The married
couple's allowance for those aged 65 and over will be increased by Pounds
200.
Measures will be brought forward to simplify the assessment and collection
of personal tax from 1996-97.
The proposals, which were outlined in the Inland Revenue consultation paper
'A Simpler System for Assessing Personal Tax' published in November 1992,
offer the option of self-assessment to all who pay tax by assessment; apply
the same rules for assessment and payment of tax to income from different
sources; and simplify tax for the self-employed by assessing income for each
year as it arises instead of on the preceding year' basis.
Benefits and expenses: The car benefit scale charges will be increased by 8
per cent from 6 April 1993. From 6 April 1994 they will be replaced by a
charge of 35 per cent of the list price of the car, with discounts for
business mileage and for cars four or more years old. These scale charges
are used for employers' national insurance contributions as well as income
tax.
The scales for assessing the benefit of fuel provided by employers for
private use in company cars will be increased by 20 per cent, and the
reduction in the charge for 18,000 or more business miles a year will be
abolished, from 6 April 1993. The scales are used for employers' national
insurance contributions as well as income tax. The fuel scales for VAT will
be similarly amended.
The existing charge on vans made available by employers for private use will
be replaced from 6 April 1993 by a standard charge of Pounds 500 a year, or
Pounds 350 if the van is four or more years old. Any benefit from a van
weighing more than 3.5 tonnes will be exempt from tax.
The benefit-in-kind of workplace sports facilities will be exempt from tax
from 6 April 1993.
There will be a ceiling of Pounds 8,000 per move on expenses and benefits
which qualify for tax relief when paid or provided by employers as part of
relocation packages.
In future, relief will be available whether or not employees sell their old
home. The relief will be put onto a statutory basis.
Concessionary relief for payments made to help meet additional housing costs
following a job related move will be withdrawn.
The changes will apply to employees who start a new job on or after 6 April
1993, but there will be transitional arrangements to protect employees who
are already committed to moving.
Outplacement counselling provided to redundant employees will be exempt from
income tax with effect from 16 March 1993, and restrictions which in some
cases prevent employers getting tax relief on the costs will be removed.
Tax relief on mortgage interest will be restricted to 20 per cent with
effect from 6 April 1994. Relief will remain at 25 per cent for those aged
65 and over who take out a loan to buy a life annuity.
The stamp duty threshold for transactions in land and property will be
raised from Pounds 30,000 to Pounds 60,000 for instruments executed on or
after 16 March 1993 and not stamped before 23 March 1993.
Borrowers will be entitled to mortgage interest relief where, on or after 16
March 1993, a lender substitutes a borrower's new home for a previous home
as security for a loan.
Under present law, relief is available only if the new home is bought with a
new loan.
Temporary relief for mortgage interest will be extended to: borrowers who
move out of their home without taking out a loan to buy a new home, provided
the property is put up for sale; elderly people who move out of a property
used as security for a loan which is used to buy an annuity, provided that
the property is put up for sale.
These changes will apply to mortgage interest paid on or after 16 March
1993.
Two further minor changes to the tax treatment of housing are: new rules
will be introduced for stamp duty on property purchased under the rent to
mortgage and rent to loan schemes being created by the Housing and Urban
Development Bill; Inland Revenue will be given clear statutory authority to
recover amounts overclaimed by MIRAS lenders, together with appropriate
interest and penalties, with effect from Royal Assent.
Savings and financial services: Business Expansion Scheme tax relief will no
longer be available to individuals who obtain loans which are connected in
any way with shareholdings they acquire through the scheme.
This applies for shares issued on or after 16 March 1993.
The maximum level of earnings for which pension provision may be made with
tax relief will remain at Pounds 75,000.
A new scheme will be introduced to replace the special reserve fund and
enable Lloyd's underwriters to build up a tax-free reserve to meet losses.
Gains on assets representing invested premiums will be chargeable as trading
profits rather than to capital gains tax. The tax treatment of certain
reliefs and expenses will be simplified.
Two minor measures are: repayments to friendly societies for their
non-pension exempt business will be put onto a statutory basis; a number of
minor amendments will be made to the administrative rules for Personal
Equity Plans.
Charities: The minimum size of single donations to charities which qualify
for relief under the Gift Aid scheme will be reduced from Pounds 400 to
Pounds 250 from 16 March 1993.
The annual limit on charitable donations qualifying for income tax relief
under the payroll giving scheme will be raised from Pounds 600 to Pounds 900
from 6 April 1993.
Tax relief for voluntary contributions by an employer towards costs incurred
by a charitable agency in running a payroll giving scheme will be put onto a
statutory basis.
Residence rules: The rule under which someone who has accommodation
available for use in the UK is considered resident for tax purposes for any
year in which they visit the UK, will be abolished. This applies to income
and capital gains tax and takes effect from 6 April 1993.
Taxation of dividends: The value of tax credits attached to dividends paid
after 5 April 1993 will be reduced from 25 per cent to 20 per cent.
The income tax charge on dividends will be reduced from the basic rate of 25
per cent to the lower rate of 20 per cent.
This means that basic and lower rate taxpayers will have no more tax to pay
on their dividends, and no part of the tax credit will be payable to lower
rate taxpayers. Higher rate taxpayers will continue to be liable at the
higher rate of 40 per cent, of which 20 per cent will be met by the tax
credit.
Charities with dividend income will be able to claim special payments for a
four year period to ease the transition to the new lower rate of tax
credits.
The rate of advance corporation tax (ACT) will be reduced from 25 per cent
to 22 1/2 per cent for 1993-94 and to 20 per cent from 1994-95.
Business taxation: A consultative document is being issued with a view to
legislation in 1994 on a proposal which would allow companies to reclaim
surplus ACT which arises from certain dividends paid out of foreign income
which has borne foreign tax.
The Government intends in any event to legislate in 1994 for such a scheme
for international headquarters companies.
The tax treatment of foreign exchange gains and losses will be reformed so
that gains and losses on all monetary assets and liabilities will be taxed
or relieved as income as they accrue.
The date for implementation of these changes will be announced in due
course.
A number of changes will be made to limit the scope for tax avoidance:
interest accruing after 31 March 1993 which is payable within multinational
groups on certain loans and other forms of debt will become chargeable to
tax as it accrues rather than when it arises; group companies will no longer
be able to set certain capital losses against capital gains where the losses
arise outside the group and are brought in by a company joining the group.
This will apply to disposals on or after 16 March 1993, where a company
joined the group after 31 March 1987; where there is a change in company
ownership, in certain circumstances it will no longer be possible to set off
ACT paid after the change against corporation tax paid before it; UK
companies which control foreign companies will (subject to certain
exclusions) be liable to UK tax on the profits of the foreign company
arising on or after 16 March 1993 where the overseas tax paid by that
foreign company is less than three-quarters (previously one half) of the tax
that would be payable if it were resident in the UK; the capital allowance
provisions for connected persons will be extended to qualifying hotels,
commercial buildings in enterprise zones and scientific research assets, and
will be amended so that elections are available only where both parties are
entitled to capital allowances; the provisions which limit capital
allowances for assets leased overseas will be amended to ensure that they
operate as originally intended; the basis on which contributions by
employers to approved occupational pension schemes may be allowed for tax
purposes will be clarified, with effect from 6 April 1993; changes will be
made, with effect from 16 March 1993, to the capital gains rules applying to
exchanges of shares and securities under company take-overs, reconstructions
and reorganisations of share capital.
European Community (EC) agricultural quotas for ewe and suckler cow premiums
will qualify for rollover relief from 1 January 1993.
Other qualifying assets may be introduced in future by Treasury Order.
Other changes are: the period for which businesses can claim relief for
costs incurred before trading begins will be extended from five to seven
years.
Relief will also be extended to trade related charges paid by companies, and
costs of preparing waste disposal sites, incurred before trading begins;
some improvements will be made to the Pay and File rules which come into
force on 1 October 1993, including provision for a wider range of people to
sign company returns; the capital gain chargeable to tax when a company
grants a share option to an employee under an approved scheme will be
limited to the amount, if any, actually paid for the option by the employee;
the rules for the recovery of under-deductions of PAYE by Government
departments will be brought into line with those for the private sector from
1993-94.
Oil taxation: The rate of petroleum revenue tax (PRT) will be reduced from
75 per cent to 50 per cent from 1 July 1993, and PRT will be abolished for
fields which get development consent on or after 16 March 1993.
Subject to transitional arrangements, spending on exploring for and
appraising new fields may no longer be set against PRT arising from existing
fields.
Similar changes will be made for future development costs in fields for
which PRT has been abolished. The special PRT allowance for tariff receipts
will not be given when tariffs are paid from a new non-PRT field.
Double taxation relief will be made available to reduce a PRT liability on
certain non-oil production receipts.
Capital gains tax: The capital gains tax annual exempt amount will remain at
Pounds 5,800 for individuals and Pounds 2,900 for most trusts.
Entrepreneurs who sell shares in their own company will not be liable to
capital gains tax when the gains are reinvested in unquoted shares in other
qualifying trading companies. This takes effect from 16 March 1993.
The capital gains tax retirement relief provisions will be changed to relax
the shareholding condition to a single 5 per cent test and allow full-time
working employees, as well as directors, to qualify for the relief. This
takes effect from 16 March 1993.
Inheritance tax: The threshold for inheritance tax will remain at Pounds
150,000.
Some minor changes will be made to inheritance tax: the three year period
after death during which land and buildings may be sold and the sale price
substituted for the value at death, will be extended to four years for sales
from 16 March 1993; where an estate contains investments with quotations
that have been suspended within a year after death, the investment, if
unsold, may be valued for inheritance tax purposes at the value one year
after death.
This will apply where the death occurred on or after 16 March 1992; in
inheritance tax appeals, the Special Commissioners will be given powers to
refer questions about the value of land to the Lands Tribunal.
CUSTOMS AND EXCISE
Value added tax: VAT will be charged on domestic fuel and power at 8 per
cent from 1 April 1994 and at the full standard rate from 1 April 1995.
The turnover threshold above which traders are required to register for VAT
will rise from Pounds 36,600 to Pounds 37,600 from 17 March 1993, in line
with the increase in the RPI in the year to December 1992. The
deregistration threshold will rise from Pounds 35,100 to Pounds 36,000 from
1 May 1993.
All major VAT penalties on late returns and misdeclarations will be reformed
during 1993. The reforms are the outcome of reviews announced by the
Chancellor in his 1991 and 1992 Budgets and consultation with traders.
Traders will be able to claim VAT relief on bad debts after six months
rather than a year, from 1 April 1993.
More small businesses will be able to benefit from the cash accounting
scheme, under which VAT is handled on the basis of cash paid and received
rather than invoiced. The turnover limit below which firms may join the
scheme is being increased from Pounds 300,000 to Pounds 350,000 a year from
1 April 1993; and businesses will no longer have to make a written
application to Customs and Excise to join.
There are a number of minor changes to VAT: new arrangements are being
introduced to simplify the taxation of so called 'triangular' transactions
involving traders located in different EC member states from 1 August 1993;
the VAT relief on samples is to be simplified and widened to help businesses
provide samples, with effect from Royal Assent.
This will help the music industry in particular; a scheme is being
introduced to extend the number of horse owners eligible for VAT
registration; for the second year of the Payments on Account scheme starting
in October 1993, businesses are to be included on the basis of their VAT
liabilities in 1992-93.
Under this scheme certain large businesses are required to make a monthly
payment on account towards their quarterly VAT bills; a special scheme
covering gold sales between registered traders will be introduced from 1
April 1993, to minimise the increased scope for fraud arising from the
introduction of the single market; the law on input tax will be clarified to
ensure that businesses only reclaim VAT on goods and services purchased for
making taxable supplies, with effect from Royal Assent; controls will be
introduced, with effect from Royal Assent, to protect VAT and customs duty
on vehicles brought into the UK.
The previous controls lapsed when car tax was abolished in November 1992;
all training, including work experience, provided under Government funded
training programmes will be exempt from VAT from 1 April 1993.
This widens an existing exemption for certain training; the zero-rating on
certain protective boots and helmets approved by the British Standards
Institution will be extended to similar products meeting equivalent EC
safety standards; parts and equipment for some ships and aircraft, other
than those used for recreational purposes, will be zero-rated from 1 April
1993.
Excise duties: Most excise duties will rise from 6pm on 16 March 1993. The
duty on spirits is not being increased.
The duty on road fuels will be raised on average by at least 3 per cent in
real terms in future Budgets. This will encourage more efficient use of fuel
and reduce emissions of carbon dioxide. Developments in charging for road
use will be taken into account in determining the appropriate level of duty.
The National Lottery, which is due to start in 1994, will be taxed at a rate
of 12 per cent of gross stakes.
Most rates of gaming machine licence duty will be increased by 20 per cent
from 1 May 1993, except for the duty on small prize machines costing less
than 5p per play which is unchanged and will be abolished from 1 November
1993.
The exemption limit for fairground bingo will be increased to Pounds 25 from
5 April 1993.
Hydrocarbon oil duties will be extended to all fuel substitutes including
orimulsion (a fuel oil substitute), rapeseed diesel and certain motor fuel
additives from shortly after Royal Assent.
The definition of hand rolling tobacco will be revised from Royal Assent.
This is to stop pipe tobacco, which has a lower rate of duty, being marketed
for rolling into cigarettes.
Vehicle excise duties: Duty on cars, light goods vehicles, vans and taxis
will rise from Pounds 110 to Pounds 125 from 17 March 1993. A range of minor
rates, including those applying to motorcycles, trade licences, and small
lorries, are increased by a similar percentage.
The rate for special type vehicles will be increased to Pounds 4,250 from 17
March 1993, and to Pounds 5,000 from Budget day in November 1993.
Concessionary rates for vintage motorcycles will be simplified. Other VED
rates, including the majority of those for lorries, are unchanged.
BUSINESS RATES
England and Wales: Rate bills for properties in England and Wales which are
in transition to higher bills as a result of the 1990 reforms will not
increase in real terms in 1993-94. This change will reduce the total rates
bill in England and Wales by 2.6 per cent. Bills will rise in line with the
uprating of business poundages already announced in November 1992 which is
based on the rise in the RPI in the year to September 1992 (3.6 per cent).
Scotland and Northern Ireland: Scotland and Northern Ireland have different
arrangements for business rates but their total rates bill for 1993-94 will
also be reduced by 2.6 per cent.
National insurance contributions: From 1 April 1994 the main rate of
employees' national insurance contributions will be increased by 1
percentage point to 10 per cent and the Class 4 rate of contributions for
the self-employed will be increased by 1 percentage point to 7.3 per cent.
