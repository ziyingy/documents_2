TWELVE Danes have begun a private legal case to try to block the Maastricht
treaty, Reuter reports.
The Copenhagen city court has yet to decide whether to accept the case,
which challenges the treaty on the grounds that it would enable Community
law to overrule the Danish constitution.
Mr Poul Nyrup Rasmussen, prime minister, said the group had no case. But the
12 are hoping to delay ratification of the treaty in Denmark and prevent it
going into force throughout the EC.
Mr Rasmussen claimed that Maastricht would make 'no changes in the
relationship between the constitution and EC law'. He added: 'A ruling from
the EC court which conflicts with the Danish constitution is totally
improbable.'
