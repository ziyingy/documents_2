Amoco has decided to limit its gas exploration activities in Poland dropping
a USDollars 8m concession won 18 months ago on two tracts totalling 2.7m
acres, one south of Warsaw and the other south east of Lublin near the
country's eastern frontier, writes Christopher Bobinski in Warsaw.
The company blames a fall in oil and natural gas prices as well as the
Polish government's failure to extend tax breaks.
Both Amoco and British Gas which won similar rights last autumn have made a
start to full scale exploration operations contingent on the extension of
tax concessions.
Amoco says it will nevertheless be bidding for new exploration tracts in
Poland and will continue with a USDollars 10m exploration programme for coal
bed methane on a 120,000-acre patch in Silesia.
Amoco had originally planned to spend USDollars 20m on exploration in
Poland. British Gas is planning a USDollars 20m programme and a Shell/Exxon
consortium is also negotiating with the Poles for exploration rights.
