PRESIDENT George Bush yesterday asked Congress for Dollars 7.6bn (Pounds
3.81bn) in emergency aid to help clean up after Hurricane Andrew, which left
an estimated 250,000 people homeless in Florida and Louisiana last month,
writes George Graham in Washington.
Mr Bush said he was confident there would be no 'gridlock' between him and
Congress over the aid package.
