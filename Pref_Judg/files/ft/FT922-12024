SCOTLAND Yard said yesterday it was concerned that a confidential report
about intelligence on IRA activities in Great Britain had been leaked in the
Republic of Ireland.
The Irish Times reported that the document showed the Metropolitan police
had 'little intelligence' on IRA active service units said to be behind the
recent bombing campaign in London. The newspaper claimed the document said
that the level of threat remained high and that an attempt at a
'spectacular' incident could not be discounted.
