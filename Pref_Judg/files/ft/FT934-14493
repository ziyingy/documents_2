BRITISH AIRWAYS is to ban smoking on its longest routes on a trial basis
from Jan-uary 1. BA chairman Sir Colin Marshall said the ban on flights to
and from Australia and New Zealand was being introduced because demand for
smoking seats had been falling rapidly on many routes.
The no-smoking trial will apply to all BA flights to Sydney, Melbourne,
Brisbane, Adelaide, Perth and Auck-land via both Singapore and Bangkok.
