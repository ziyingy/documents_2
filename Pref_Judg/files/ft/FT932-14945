ARGENTINA is to begin privatising YPF, its national oil company, in June or
July, instead of October as planned.
YPF's net worth is estimated at Dollars 8bn (Pounds 5.2bn) and is to be
floated on local and international equity markets. The sale will be the
country's biggest privatisation.
Mr Daniel Marx, Argentina's chief financial negotiator, said yesterday: 'We
feel the opportunity (of) markets being receptive generally to stocks,
particularly oil and Latin American stocks. The stars have not been aligned
like this for a long time.'
He denied the new timing was due to domestic political factors or to
worsening government cash-flow. He said the privatisation's detailed
planning and marketing strategy would have to await appointment of advisers.
However, he said the government had already decided to sell as much of the
company as quickly as possible. It holds 100 per cent of YPF stock and is
legally required to retain a 20 per cent stake.
