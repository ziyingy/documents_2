THE MINISTRY of Defence has lost tens of millions of pounds by failing to
use flight simulators instead of aircraft in training, according to a report
published today.
The National Audit Office, the public-spending watchdog, points to errors
including the mothballing of a Pounds 25m simulator for the Harrier GR7
because of delays completing the site in Germany which will house it.
Storage is costing Pounds 95,000 a month.
It concludes: 'There is an urgent need for the development and maintenance
of databases on the cost and effectiveness of current methods of training
including simulators.'
Simulators are used to cut the cost of training pilots. The operating costs
of simulators are about 10 per cent those of aircraft - which use fuel, need
extra maintenance and can be damaged by trainees.
The three armed services have so far spent more than Pounds 450m between
them on simulators and intend to spend a further Pounds 700m over the next
decade.
However, the watchdog points out that some of the simulators do not do their
job. The simulator for the Tornado GR1 fighter aircraft, for example, 'does
not realistically represent the experience of low flying'.
Another simulator, the Air Navigation Trainer at RAF Finningley, 'is so old
that interest has been expressed in it by the Science Museum'.
Many of those that do work are not used enough, the watchdog continues. On
average, simulators are used for less than five hours a day, compared with
the 14 hours available. The report notes that simulators used by British
Airways are used for 20 hours a day.
The report adds that the MoD now recognises that simulators should be
developed alongside aircraft and that both should enter service at the same
time.
