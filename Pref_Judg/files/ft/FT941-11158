Tens of thousands of users of the Internet, a global 'information highway',
have had their passwords stolen, leaving their private computer files
andmessages vulnerable to intruders.
Internet is an international web of computer networks linking about 2m
computers in businesses, government offices, universities and homes. Use of
the Internet has grown fast, especially in companies which see it as a
low-cost international electronic mail system. Up to 1m new users per month
are tapping into the Internet, according to data traffic counters.
'Intruders have already captured access information for tens of thousands of
systems across the Internet,' says an advisory issued by the Computer
Emergency Response Team, a US-government funded panel of computer experts
that oversees Internet security.
The alert was issued on Thursdaynight. 'All systems that offer remote access
(to the Internet) are at risk,' CERT warned. 'Intruders have already
captured access information for tens of thousands of systems across the
Internet.'
Secret passwords have apparently been collected illicitly by people using
sophisticated surveillance software programs called 'sniffers' that record
the first several words typed by a legitimate Internet user to establish a
link with another computer on the Internet. This usually includes a user's
name and password.
CERT has recommended that all Internet users change their passwords. This is
only a short term solution because new passwords may also be illicitly
recorded. Expert advice is that computer systems be isolated from the
Internet to prevent invasion.
Security on the Internet is a rising problem, said Mr Bruce Baker, head of
information security program at SRI International. 'There are now many, many
peopledoing unethical things on the Internet.'
Thesecurity problems on the Internet raise questions about future
'superinformation highways' that the Clinton administration is promoting as
a boon to the US economy and society.
