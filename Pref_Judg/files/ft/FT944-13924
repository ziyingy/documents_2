Electricity prices for the domestic customer have fallen 2 per cent in real
terms since the privatisation of the electricity industry five years ago,
says the Centre for the Study of Regulated Industries.
In its annual report on charges, the centre says typical bills have risen by
10 per cent since privatisation, excluding the effects of the introduction
of value added tax, but in that period inflation was 12 per cent.
