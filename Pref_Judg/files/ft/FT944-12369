Russia has suspended shipments of oil to Cuba because the Caribbean state
has not met its promised level of sugar exports to Russia, Mr Oleg Davydov,
the Russian trade minister, said yesterday. The cut in supplies to a country
which once enjoyed the closest links with the former Soviet Union is
expected to further damage the recession-hit Cuban economy.
The decision is in line with Russia's attitude to other countries which once
enjoyed oil imports for barter, or at prices far below the world market
level - including former Soviet states which are now independent countries.
Mr Davydov said Russia had exported 1.5m tonnes of oil to Cuba, but had
received only 500,000 tonnes of sugar - 550,000 tonnes short of the amount
agreed. He said Russia would sell the remaining 1m tonnes of oil it had
agreed to ship to Cuba on the world market, 'adding around Dollars 120m to
the national budget'. 'If after our own sugar harvest the need arises to
import more sugar cane, then we are prepared to open negotiations again with
Cuba on this issue in 1995,' Mr Davydov said. He added, however, that the
barter of sugar for oil was unprofitable.
An official of the Cuban sugar organisation, Cubazucar, said the deal,
agreed last December, was still active - although only partly fulfilled. 'It
doesn't mean the accord has stopped.' However, Cuba would not be able to
deliver sugar until December or January, after this year's harvest.
