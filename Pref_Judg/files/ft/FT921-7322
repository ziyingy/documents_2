MRS MARGARET Thatcher, the former prime minister, joined Conservative
Euro-sceptics in the Commons yesterday in an attempt to reopen issues raised
by the Maastricht Treaty.
They failed to force a vote on a bill to secure a referendum on the treaty's
provisions for European political union.
A procedural manoeuvre, encouraged by government whips, resulted in the
debate being adjourned, effectively killing the Referendum Bill.
Mrs Thatcher favours a referendum in the event of the main political parties
agreeing that sterling should be abandoned in favour of a single European
currency.
The efforts by the whips to prevent a widening of divisions in Conservative
ranks over the European Community were reflected in a speech last night by
Mr Jonathan Aitken, MP for South Thanet. Acknowledging his role as a
'leading Euro-sceptic', he told a constituency meeting that he supported the
'negotiating success' of Mr John Major at Maastricht.
Mr Aitken is chairman of the policy committee of a group of backbench
Euro-sceptics which yesterday issued a statement opposing Britain's
involvement in a single European currency. The group warned such a currency
could lead to the payment of 'massive subsidies' to most other member
states.
The statement also advocated Britain's withdrawal from the European Monetary
System - a step opposed by Mr Aitken in his speech. Mr Peter Lilley, trade
and industry secretary, said yesterday Europe was 80 per cent of the way to
a single market.
Of the 282 measures drawn up seven years ago, 235 had been agreed by the EC
and the rest were scheduled for completion by the beginning of next year,
when the single market began. Britain takes the EC presidency for six months
from July. Mr Lilley said the main task was to finish the process.
