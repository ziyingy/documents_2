SANCTIONS against China and Taiwan for illegal trading in rhino horns will
today be considered by the 120-nation UN Convention on International Trade
in Endangered Species (Cites), David Gardner writes from Brussels.
The standing committee of Cites, meeting in Brussels, is examining
allegations that these countries have failed to stamp out the trade, banned
since 1976.
The sanctions could take the form of a ban on virtually all wild animal
products from and into China and Taiwan, not just products from rare
animals, according to the Environmental Investigation Agency.
The last Cites standing committee meeting in Washington last March decided
to defer any decision until after further consultations with China and
Taiwan.
The EIA and the World Society for the Protection of Animals say that in July
 -a month after both governments claimed to have ended the trade - their
teams found a one-tonne stockpile of rhino horn in China, equivalent to the
number of rhinos now surviving in Zimbabwe. In Taiwan, 19 out of 24
pharmacies admitted to stocking rhino horn - used for reducing fever - while
two-thirds of Hong Kong chemists had rhino horn for sale.
