DE NATIONALE Investerings-bank, the Dutch banking group with strong links to
the government, has set up an Ecu500m Euro-medium-term note programme in a
move to expand and diversify its funding base.
The programme will be used to 'tap the international capital markets on a
more systematic basis' than in the past, said Mr Peter van der Lugt, a
member of the DNIB board of managing directors.
The bank's borrowing programme is set to increase from Fl 2.5bn (Dollars
1.57bn) this year to more than Fl 3bn in 1993, as its balance sheet grows.
Also, demand from corporate clients for loans denominated in dollars has
increased its need for foreign currency borrowing.
In future, About half of the bank's funding will be sought in the
international capital markets, through the MTN programme and Eurobond
offerings.
The programme, arranged by Morgan Stanley, has been rated AA plus by
Standard &amp; Poor's and Aa3 by Moody's.
