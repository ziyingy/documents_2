Sir, Your report, 'Gas industry and users step up call for legislation'
(September 8), implies that all consumer groups want the government to
introduce competition in the domestic gas market at the earliest
opportunity. This is not the case.
The National Consumer Council believes much more information needs to be
made available before domestic consumers can be confident that the changes
will be to their benefit.
The ordinary gas user is caught between British Gas warning of steep price
rises and independent companies promising cuts. How can consumers make up
their minds when there is no detailed information on the new industries'
obligations and no independent cost-benefit analysis?
While we believe competition benefits consumers when it increases choice, we
are concerned that any real choice in a domestic gas market might only be
available to more affluent consumers living in particular geographical
areas. It certainly seems unlikely that companies will fight over the custom
of low-income households using pre-payment meters.
Regulation of gas supply since privatisation has led to lower bills for
consumers in real terms. We do not want to see a successful system
dismantled before the advantages of an open market for all consumers have
been established.
