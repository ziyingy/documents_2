It was a grim coincidence that the first comprehensive exhibition of
artefacts recovered from the Titanic opened at the National Maritime Museum
in Greenwich a few days after the sinking of the ferry Estonia.
The fascination surrounding the loss of the supposedly unsinkable Titanic,
on its maiden voyage, was overshadowed by the shock of the sinking of a
modern ferry at a cost of more than 900 lives. The Titanic went down after
it struck an iceberg off Newfoundland on April 14, 1912. Only 705 of the
2,228 passengers and crew survived.
Timing apart, historians and naval experts see other parallels between the
two doomed vessels. Both were designed and built to prevailing standards but
both were found wanting.
The Titanic was launched when the number of lifeboats carried reflected the
cubic footage of the vessel devoted to passenger accommodation rather than
the number of passengers and crew. Its designers added a 12 per cent safety
margin to the minimum required by the Board of Trade but there were still
only enough lifeboats for half those on board.
A more comprehensive sub-division of the Titanic by internal bulkheads - a
design issue which is again being hotly debated after the Estonia sinking in
October - might have saved the liner, some experts think.
For 73 years the Titanic lay undisturbed, up to two miles down on the floor
of the Atlantic Ocean. The prospect of ever finding the vessel and answering
the unsolved mysteries of its sinking appeared remote.
But in 1985 the wreck was discovered by a joint French-US expedition.
RMS Titanic Inc, a New York-based company, was declared 'salvor in
possession', meaning that it had unique rights to explore the vessel and
raise material.
The company has since carried out three expeditions, the most recent in
July, using a submersible provided by the French Oceanographic Research
Institute. It has raised a total of 3,600 artefacts.
RMS Titanic is committed to raising material from the Titanic and putting it
on general display. It is pledged not to sell any of its finds.
Some 150 objects are on display at the maritime museum, include a ship's
porthole, metal deck bench ends and a letter from a manufacturer lamenting
the demise of the feather boa as a fashion accessory.
Video footage taken from the submersible shows the ship's rail, chandeliers
hanging in a long-abandoned state room and racks of plates.
The chance to stage the exhibition was offered to the maritime museum 'out
of the blue' by RMS, says Dr Eric Kentley, a curator.
There are no plans to take the exhibition to any other museums around the
world though the maritime museum and RMS are working on designs to establish
a permanent museum to display the material.
The Japanese meanwhile, have announced plans to build a full-scale replica
of the Titanic to act as a floating hotel and conference centre. All the
details of its interior would be replicated although there would be no
engines or steering gear.
As the Titanic sank into the darkness of the Atlantic it broke its back and
landed in two separate sections. When it hit the ocean floor the bow section
ploughed into the mud, obscuring to this day the details of how large a gash
was caused by the iceberg.
'The technology exists to remove the silt from the bow section but the
problem is to find the capital to get the equipment down there,' says John
Eaton, a historian with an interest in the Titanic going back more than 45
years.
Recovery of material has been limited to the sea around the vessel. A
decision to treat its interior as a grave site has meant that no attempt has
been made to raise artefacts from inside the hull. Although very few
survivors of the sinking are still alive 'people are very sensitive about
anyone going into the hull', comments Dr Kentley. Eaton confesses to finding
this ban 'very frustrating'.
Although the intense cold, the absence of light and low oxygen levels on the
ocean bed have slowed the deterioration of the Titanic, chemical attack and
sea-bed bacteria have eaten into the metal, staining many objects black.
A comparison of the photographs taken in 1986, and those from a descent in
1993, show a marked deterioration of the wreck, says Eaton. Dr Kentley
thinks there may be as little as 10 years left to continue work on the hull
before it disintegrates.
RMS and its backers are keen to raise more material from the wreck. However,
even if a sudden deterioration was to halt work, enough has been raised to
create a powerful reminder of the fate of the Titanic, and any other vessel
and its crew which underestimate the power of the sea. The exhibition, says
Dr Kentley: 'Is a timely reminder that the sea signs no treaties.'
The Wreck of the Titanic. Until April 2, 1995.
