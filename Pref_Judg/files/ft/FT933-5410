Sir, I am surprised that your article on the problems at Euro Disney ('Mr
Grumpy at the door', September 1) concentrates on purely technical reasons
for the company's current difficulties. Although I have yet to visit the
place myself, I have discussed it on several occasions with visiting French
friends and business colleagues, and have been surprised at the consistency
of their antipathy to the venture. What comes across is a strong feeling
that the whole idea is alien to French culture, to the extent that they will
have nothing to do with it. These same people would, I suspect, not hesitate
to visit Disneyland or Disneyworld while en vacances in the US, where both
would be clearly seen as integral parts and manifestations of the indigenous
culture.
I suspect that Euro Disney and its shareholders may have to face the
unpalatable fact that the decision to site Euro Disney in France, a country
with, at best, an ambivalent attitude to the virtues of imported American
culture, was a big strategic error. Perhaps the opening of Eurotunnel next
year will make Euro Disney accessible to sufficient numbers of Anglo-Saxons
to make a real difference to its fortunes. The UK would have provided a far
more congenial home for Mickey Mouse and his relations.
