The oil sector remained very much in the front line as the market reassessed
the implications of changes in petroleum revenue tax and the proposed
changes in advance corporation tax.
The market quickly made up its mind that the biggest winner from the Budget
moves was British Petroleum, whose shares followed Tuesday's 9 gain with a
further rise of 9 1/2 to 304 1/2 p, the stock's highest closing level since
November 1991. Turnover was a hefty 22m shares. Shell Transport, however,
settled 2 off at 578p. Enterprise Oil jumped 13 to 505p and Lasmo edged
forward 3 to 189p.
One sector specialist said: 'The simple conclusion has to be that the moves
favour the big companies at the expense of the so-called tiddlers; the
companies paying high levels of petroleum revenue tax, for example BP and
Enterprise Oil, as well as Lasmo, are the major beneficiaries. The small
companies who have organised their assets in a tax efficient manner are
having the rug pulled from beneath them.'
The smaller stocks edged higher at the outset but quickly came under severe
pressure. Clyde Petroleum settled 7 1/2 down at 52 1/2 p, Goal dropped 4 1/2
to 61p and Aran dipped 2 1/4 to 25 1/4 p.
