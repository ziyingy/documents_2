Very seldom is a whale caught off the eastern Caribbean island of St
Vincent. Never mind; let's have a row anyway. Dominica, Grenada, St Lucia
and St Vincent are, peculiarly enough, facing flak over commercial whaling.
Environmental lobbyists have long accused them of actively opposing efforts
to ban commercial whaling and supporting Japanese efforts to frustrate
whaling bans.
The heat will intensify when the International Whaling Commission meets in
Mexico in two months. France is proposing a 'no-whaling' sanctuary in
Antarctica; Japan is opposing it - which way will the four islands jump?
Don't get your hopes up, Greenpeace. According to an observer at last
month's Whaling Commission meeting in Australia, 'delegates from St Vincent,
St Lucia, Dominica and Grenada constantly had to hold special hallway
meetings with the Japanese to receive direction on how to vote'.
