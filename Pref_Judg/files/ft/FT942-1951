Mr Ron Brown, US commerce secretary, yesterday reported a decline in US
merchandise exports for last month, writes Our Foreign Staff.
Noting that the US trade position had deteriorated in every major foreign
market area except Latin America, he cited lower shipments of non-monetary
gold as a big factor in last month's decline. Analysts have attributed the
trend to business cycle factors. The secretary said the US trade balance in
services, led by travel expenditures, improved last month while the deficit
in goods deteriorated.
