BANANA production, the cornerstone of Ecuador's agriculture, is facing
change. Not only are exports threatened by European restrictions, but
domestic overproduction, the Sigatoka disease and low per acre productivity
will also demand action by producers.
Last year Ecuador produced a record 3.5m tonnes of bananas. The increase
over previous years (3m tonnes in 1990 and 2.5m tonnes in 1989) is largely
due to new plantations started in 1990 and 1991 - when banana prices rose -
and which have now come into production. These largely unauthorised
plantations are ballooning the supply and depressing prices.
Of great concern to Ecuador is the reform of the European Community's banana
import regime with proposals to impose a banana import quota of 2m tonnes
next year and tariff on 'dollar bananas' imported from exporters from Latin
America of up to 70 per cent. Ecuador last year exported 2.7m tonnes of
bananas worth nearly Dollars 800m.
Restrictions would affect a large percentage of Ecuador's banana exports.
Approximately 40 per cent of the fruit it produces is sold to the EC.
While the spread of the Black Sigatoka disease, which has endangered the
tropical fruit for some time, has been halted, it is not likely to be
eradicated. Measures introduced by the French Institute of Fruit and Citrus
Investigations, part of an aid programme of the French government, have had
much success in combating Sigatoka, but have not able to eliminate it
completely.
The productivity of Ecuador's banana fields is below that of its world
competitors. While the productivity in Honduras is 2,800 boxes per hectare
and 3,000 in Costa Rica, Ecuador merely produces 1,400 boxes per hectare.
Yet lower overall costs make Ecuador competitive internationally.
To give producers an incentive while continuing to protect consumers, the
government is to implement a price reform of the principal agricultural
goods whose prices have so far remained fixed.
Supply and demand will determine the prices of sugar, rice, maize, soya,
milk and barley within a certain parameter set by the ministry of
agriculture. The bottom end of the price bracket will ensure farmers a
minimum revenue. When prices hit the top end, distributors are allowed to
search for cheaper imports on the international market.
The importance of coffee and cacao, which cover nearly a third of the area
sown with primary agricultural products, is likely to decrease. Given low
prices and an over-supply of coffee on world markets, agriculture minister
Mr Mariano Gonzales Portes has indicated that some of the coffee
cultivations will eventually have to be replaced with other crops.
In spite of a sugar cane production of over 3.5m tonnes annually, Ecuador
has had to import sugar this year. Producers hope to cover domestic demand
next year but need considerable credits from the Andean Development
Corporation to do so.
Few major crops have seen their production increase significantly recently.
One exception is the soya bean; its production has nearly quadrupled in the
past years and is expected to grow in the future.
One of the reasons producers have not been able to significantly increase
the yield of their crops in past years, says Mr Gonzales, has been the lack
of sufficient investment in agricultural research. Only 0.3 per cent of
gross domestic product has gone into agricultural research in the past
years, he says.
The government plans to reverse that trend and, with the help of the
Institute of Agricultural Investigations which became autonomous only in
July, intends to promote new and higher-yielding agricultural products.
INIAP has recently developed a new type of yuca whose yield is three times
that of the traditional type when processed into flour and 10 times as high
when processed into starch.
The institute also engages in other activities, such as giving technical
advice to indigenous groups in the central province of Chimborazo on the
cultivation of the traditional crop quinua. This cereal, grown by the Incas
centuries ago, has a high nutritional value.
Although a promising crop, the efficient commercialisation of quinua is
difficult, says Mr Gonzales, because of the unfavourable size of land
parcels in the areas in which quinua is grown. Land holdings in the
mountainous Sierra region are much smaller than in the coast and are
typically used for subsistence farming.
Thirty per cent of land holdings in the Sierra are classified as small (10
hectares or less), while 52 per cent are medium sized (10 to 100 hectares)
and only 18 per cent are more than 100 hectares. Land holdings in the
coastal provinces of Manabi, Guayas, and Los Rios are generally larger and
used in commercial monoculture such as banana, cacao or coffee.
In the past two-and-a-half decades the amount of land used for livestock
production has more than tripled to nearly 5m hectares, which in part
explains Ecuador's dazzling rate of deforestation. Settlers continue to
slash-and-burn as a way to clear areas of forest on which to grow beans and
maize for one season before turning it into pasture.
The most rapid expansion of pasture has occured in the coastal areas,
especially in the province of Esmeraldas where huge tracts of land have been
cleared by settlers as well as lumber companies. In the Sierra the increase
of pasture is more due to the abandonment of agricultural activities.
A large potential for growth lies in Ecuador's horticulture, according to Mr
Gonzales, especially tropical fruits but also flowers which have found an
increasingly strong market in the US and Europe.
Yet the volatility in the production of such fruits for the export market is
exemplified by the Babaco fruit. Production in 1987 reached 3,834 tonnes but
then steadily declined over the years and in 1991 equalled only 510 tonnes.
Although outside the hurricane zone, Ecuador suffers repeatedly from the
shifting precipitation patterns caused by the Pacific current El Nino. The
current carries warmer waters to the coast and causes droughts in some parts
of the country and floods in others. This year 22 people were killed and
30,000 hectares of rice, banana, cotton and maize crops were lost. The
damage in the coastal areas alone is estimated to have been Dollars 70m.
At a time when droughts have caused hydroelectric plants to reduce their
output, the government plans to revive a decade-old project to irrigate
nearly 30,000 hectares of arable land on the Santa Helena peninsula west of
the port city Guayaquil. The four dams along the river Daule are also to
provide the area with electricity and drinking water. So far Brazil, Italy
and Spain have agreed to co-finance the project.
