EUROPE'S three remaining indigenous large computer manufacturers have formed
a joint venture to develop trans-European systems for public authorities.
Groupe Bull of France, Olivetti of Italy and Siemens-Nixdorf of Germany said
yesterday they had created a new company, Trans European Information Systems
(TEIS), which would have its headquarters in Brussels.
The new company, which will have the legal structure of a European economic
interest group, is a further step in a scheme to build a European-wide
computer network - the 'European Nervous System' - which the three
manufacturers have been exploring for well over a year. They have already
established a number of laboratories to work on technical aspects of the
system.
The European Nervous System had its origin in an idea floated by the
European Commission but it has been seized on enthusiastically by Europe's
beleaguered computer manufacturers.
The two major benefits are an increase in sales of data processing equipment
through a form of public procurement which could not be seen as financial
aid and the opportunity to gain valuable experience of large scale projects.
They complain that US computer companies have benefited greatly from their
involvement in large public sector and defence projects.
The purpose of the new company will be to provide local authorities with
applications that improve the availability of information technology
services within the framework of the single European market.
Computer systems in each of the member-states which 'talk' to each other is
seen as a prerequisite for the establishment of harmonised services in areas
such as healthcare and environmental protection.
The applications which will run on the trans-European network will include
systems to guarantee the free movement of people, goods and capital
following the dismantling of intra-Community barriers.
