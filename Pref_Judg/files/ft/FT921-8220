WESTERN countries must make more money available to help meet the estimated
DM12bn (Pounds 4.1bn) cost of making nuclear power stations in Russia and
the rest of eastern Europe safe, according to Mr Adolf Huttl, head of the
KWU energy division of Germany's Siemens industrial group.
He said the foreign exchange portion of this, to finance imports into the
affected countries of vital equipment such as new control instruments, could
be kept to about DM4bn.
Western industry also had to work closely with the countries to build up the
volume of local supplies and contracts in such work. This would account for
the other DM8bn.
Mr Huttl said the figures applied only to the 63 pressurised water reactors
 -just over half of which are in Russia - built with Soviet technology.
The 16 Chernobyl-type reactors were not worth improving as their faults were
too basic. The company believes they should be closed.
Mr Huttl said the funds so far made available by the EC, equivalent to a few
hundred million D-Marks, were insufficient and only covered studies and
planning work.
It was unrealistic to expect Bulgaria, Czechoslovakia, Hungary and most of
the former Soviet Union republics to close their nuclear power plants at
once, since they depended on these for electricity.
