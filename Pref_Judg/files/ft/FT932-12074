FRANCE, the first European Community country to ratify the Schengen free
travel agreement, yesterday forecast that the conditions for lifting border
checks on travellers would not be met 'before the end of this year, or even
for quite a long period'.
Mr Alain Lamassoure, France's new EC affairs minister, told parliament
France would be 'intransigent' in maintaining police controls on its borders
with other signatories of the 1990 Schengen pact until a variety of
political and technical problems were solved. Such problems included, he
said, Germany's difficulty in ratifying Schengen until it changed its asylum
law, and Italy's 'inability to reinforce its external border controls' and
its recent referendum decision to de-penalise drugs, as the Dutch have done.
But France's tougher stance towards Schengen also reflects the new
centre-right government's intention to crack down on crime and illegal
immigration. An opinion poll released yesterday showed that four out of five
French people want illegal immigrants systematically expelled from the
country.
An adviser to Mr Charles Pasqua, the hardline interior minister, recently
claimed that while French tribunals regularly order the deportation of some
25,000 people each year, only about 10,000 actually leave the country.
