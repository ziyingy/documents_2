Two more regional electricity companies have responded to last week's
price-capping agreement by the power generators.
Yorkshire Electricity said it would freeze prices for domestic and smaller
business customers from April. It also said it was passing on the benefits
of lower prices to big electricity users.
London Electricity said its cuts would average 1 per cent to 2 per cent for
business customers using more than 100kWh a year.
