THE Church of England will today be warned about the increasing financial
difficulties it faces.
The Church Commissioners will tell parishes that they must prepare to meet a
far bigger proportion of clergy stipends. The commissioners now finance an
average of 41 per cent of stipends but this is likely to fall below 30 per
cent by 1996.
The commission's report to the church's general synod meeting in York will
be the first presented by Sir Michael Colman, chairman of Reckitt &amp; Colman
and the recently appointed first church estates commissioner.
