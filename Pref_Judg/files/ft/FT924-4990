NEVER MIND what else Columbus did in 1492, so far as the Cubans are
concerned, he discovered the cigar. For those who are sticklers for detail,
the Taino Indians he encountered on the Caribbean island were seen puffing
some rolled-up leaves they called Cohiba. Anyone visiting Havana these days,
as I did earlier this month, will find much evidence of the famous admiral.
Columbus's presence is manifest not only in statues, busts and paintings but
in the Cohiba cigars made famous by his fortuitous landfall five centuries
ago this month. The name Cohiba, in fact, was revived only a few decades ago
by Fidel Castro, the Cuban leader, and was applied to a tiny selection of
special cigars destined for various heads of state and the diplomatic
community.
Cubatabaco, the state tobacco company, began giving the brand a commercial
push in the 1980s, but its creation to be the 'best-of-the-best' of the two
dozen or so famous marques of Havana cigars meant supplies falling well
short of demand.
In planning last year for the 1992 anniversary, Cubatabaco started to take
customer demand seriously by increasing output and broadening the existing
six-size range to a full family of 11 different sizes, the five new ones
simply being called Linea 1492.
This means that Cohiba now comes in all the basic sizes, but there is room
for further expansion as the market develops. No-one is predicting that its
range will be as varied as the popular Romeo y Julieta, which has 22
different lengths and widths. The new Linea 1492 types are known simply as
Siglo 1, 2, 3, 4, 5 or, in English, Century 1 to 5. Their lengths range from
4in to 6 3/4 inches, and their widths, or ring gauge, take a middle path
from a minimum 40/64th of an inch in diameter to 46/64.
These will add to the existing six sizes which form the outer edges of the
range - the Lanceros, Coronas Especiales and Panatelas at the narrower end
and the hefty Esplendidos, Robustos and Exquisitos at the other. Prices for
the full Cohiba family range between Pounds 5 per cigar to Pounds 15.
The Cohiba has generally been described as a full-flavoured cigar but the
various sizes and shapes will each have individual flavours thanks to
careful leaf selection and use of special leaves that have undergone a third
fermentation, which gives them a special heft.
Cubatabaco admits that one of the incentives to expand the Cohiba range came
from the departure from the Havana trade a few years ago of Davidoff, the
Swiss-based cigar maker. Most merchants take the view that eventually all
roads taken by discerning cigar smokers will lead to Havana, so the Davidoff
move to the Dominican Republic represents something of a risk.
Davidoff only shifted manufacture after a prolonged and complicated row with
the Cuban authorities, mainly about money, marketing and brand ownership.
This year, Davidoff has its 16 different Dominican sizes on the UK market.
These range in price from Pounds 4.60 apiece, to its top range Anniversario
No 1 at Pounds 20, one of the most expensive cigars on the market. Its
continued high prices reflect its confidence that its Dominican dash will
pay off. Smokers will have to decide for themselves, but a case can be made
for saying that Davidoff has bridged the gap between Havana and non-Havana.
