THE EUROPEAN Community is becoming less self-sufficient in fish and
shellfish at a time of rising consumption, according to a report from Frost
&amp; Sullivan, the international market research organisation.
Landings of fish for human consumption are forecast to rise from 3.96m
tonnes in 1990 to 4.18m tonnes in 1996 after touching a low of 3.95m tonnes
this year. This compares with consumption of 4.94m tonnes in 1990, rising to
5.32m tonnes in 1996.
The retail value of the EC fish market is expected to reach Dollars 22.4bn
in 1996, compared with Dollars 20.8bn in 1990.
Shellfish landings totalled only 1.33m tonnes in 1990 out of a total world
catch of 98m tonnes. EC landings are expected to rise to 1.52m tonnes in
1996, when consumption is expected to be 2.35m tonnes, up from 1990's 1.92m
tonnes.
Fish farming is expected to be supplying the market with 372,000 tonnes of
fish and 760,000 tonnes of shellfish in 1996, compared with 263,000 tonnes
and 656,000 tonnes respectively in 1990.
Until 1988 the EC was self-sufficient in fish and shellfish. The report
points out that it can still be argued that the EC lands enough fish to
support itself, as only 65 per cent of the total 1990 catch of 10.6m tonnes
in 1990 went for human consumption.
The report suggests that as supplies of common varieties such as cod,
herring and mackerel fail to meet demand, consumers are being forced to eat
less common varieties which would previously have gone for processing into
fish meal and other industrial purposes.
'The EC figures, as a percentage of the world catch, are disturbing,' says
the report. 'This is not just because they are low, but because the trend
has remained negative despite aquaculture progress.'
