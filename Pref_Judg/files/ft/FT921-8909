A WOMAN'S decision to open a personal pension plan will in most cases
improve her retirement income only marginally, according to a study
published today by the Equal Opportunities Commission, Norma Cohen writes.
'The great bulk of women are on low earnings, and the prospect of them
making a significant contribution to a personal pension is almost nil,' said
Mr Bryn Davies, an actuary who carried out the EOC research.
The study concludes that many women face poverty after retirement because
much public and private pensions provision is earnings-related. The top 10
per cent of women's salaries are earned by 50 per cent of all male workers.
The EOC calls on the government to increase the state pension, now Pounds 52
per week. It says the basic pension offers the best hope for women in
low-paid or part-time employment. At the moment, the basic state pension is
the only retirement income earned by most women.
