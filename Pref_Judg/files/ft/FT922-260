THE SIX-YEAR moratorium on commercial whaling will be challenged this week
as 37 nations gather in Glasgow for the annual meeting of the International
Whaling Commission.
Japan, Norway and Iceland still have whaling industries and want a
resumption of the hunting of minke whales. They say stocks have recovered
sufficiently to permit whaling in the Antarctic and in the north-east
Atlantic.
Mr John Gummer, secretary of state for agriculture and fisheries, who is to
open the week-long meeting tomorrow, is expected to say there can be no
resumption of commercial whaling while there is no humane way of killing
whales.
France, which is proposing the creation of a whale sanctuary in the
Antarctic, is leading the opposition. It is backed by Britain and other
European countries.
The International Whaling Commission introduced a moratorium on commercial
whaling in 1986. The moratorium has not been complete, however, partly
because Japan, Norway and Iceland carry out scientific whaling, which they
say is conducted for research.
Yesterday 3,000 people at an anti-whaling rally in Glasgow were urged by Mr
Tony Banks, Labour MP for Newham North-West, to boycott products made by the
three whaling countries.
