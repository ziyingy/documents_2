THE Gulf war, which bought Iraqi Scud missiles exploding close to El Al's
headquarters at Tel Aviv's Ben Gurion airport, turned out to have a bright
side for Israel's state-owned airline, its annual results show.
The carrier announced 1991 net profits of Dollars 38.9m, up almost three
times from the Dollars 14.1m returned in 1990. It was the sixth consecutive
annual profit for El Al, despite remaining officially in receivership where
it was placed in 1982 to rescue it from heavy debts and losses.
Although the Gulf conflict affected tourism to Israel in the first half, El
Al benefited by being the only operator bar one that continued to fly in and
out of the country during the war. It consequently took almost 100 per cent
of the traffic, where usually it has only a 50 per cent share.
With space limited, prices were also at a premium. After the war, when
passengers returned in large numbers, they were often booking at short
notice, again paying top prices. Sales were up 12 per cent at Dollars
877.6m, although the number of passengers carried fell slightly to 1.75m.
Ironically, a spokesman said yesterday profits in 1992 might not reach the
1991 level, despite a dramatic recovery in passenger traffic, because of
heavy competition and discounts on forward booking.
Last year, a trend to charter flights in the second half was reflected in a
sharp increase in contributions from El Al subsidiaries, up by more than
twice to Dollars 8.1m.
Little progress has been made so far in long-standing government plans to
privatise El Al, which would help raise much needed capital for the airline.
The company, however, has gone ahead with a big modernisation programme,
financing the purchase of seven new Boeing 757 aircraft from its own
resources. It is seeking government guarantees to help it finance the
purchase of two Boeing 747/400 aircraft in 1994.
