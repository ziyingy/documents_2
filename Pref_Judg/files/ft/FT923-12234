The grandly-named Russian Ministry of Security is trying to prove to its
countrymen that it has utterly renounced its past as the KGB and is now
really looking after their interests. Hence it has helped to organise an
exhibition of cultural contraband: Russian works of art confiscated by the
KG . . . - sorry, security ministry's officers from people attempting to
spirit them out of the country illegally.
The official line is that the attempted smuggling - which increased sharply
during the 1980s - was mainly the work of international gangs of
professional smugglers, robbing Russia of works of art to sell them abroad.
But there's evidence to suggest that many of the 'smuggled' goods were the
private property of emigrants, rather than stolen goods for sale.
Either way, the result is a fine, if eclectic, collection of icons, rare
books, paintings, jewellery and other objets d'art. The only snag is that no
catalogues are available.
There should have been, because a couple of years back a Western businessman
offered to produce some free of charge, and the delighted organisers duly
handed him the necessary photographic and written material. Alas, nothing
was ever delivered.
But that wasn't the organisers' fault. How could they have known it was just
another empty promise from the late Robert Maxwell?
