Sir, David Goodhart's report of the OECD jobs study ('Rejecting the
unthinkable and the unacceptable', June 8) concludes that 'lobby groups will
simply pick out what they want in order to reinforce what they are already
doing.' My concern is that, by removing references to the link between
long-term unemployment and rising levels of crime and drug abuse, the OECD
report leaves a gaping hole in what public services the private sector and
drugs services should be doing.
A number of the submissions to government under the City Challenge programme
included tackling local drug misuse as part of a comprehensive package of
measures to improve local economic well-being. Yet the guidance issued by
the Department of the Environment for the new single regeneration budget
makes no explicit reference to tackling drug misuse. If the government is
serious in its attempts to tackle the economically damaging impact of drug
misuse and associated crime, it must ensure its constituent departments
speak coherently. Tackling drug misuse must be a priority area in the
regeneration budget for the future.
Also, we must expect local economic development agencies and training and
enterprise councils to focus on the deleterious effect of drug misuse in
many areas and particularly among young people. We must see a process begin
whereby those responsible at the local level for training, education and
enterprise development engage in a dialogue with health, criminal justice
and specialist drug services.
