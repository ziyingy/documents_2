Argentina's foreign minister, Mr Guido di Tella, has said he would consider
paying the Falkland Islands' 2,000 inhabitants to accept Argentine
sovereignty.
In an interview, Mr Di Tella said: 'We would be willing to pay some kind of
compensation in exchange for Argentine sovereignty, but we do not want them
to be paid to get out of the islands.'
Mr Di Tella did not mention a figure, but implied it could be substantial.
He said former UK government adviser Alan Walters had proposed a similar
solution to the dispute over the islands, which led in 1982 to a 74-day
conflict between the two countries.
Mr Di Tella reiterated President Carlos Menem's claim that the islands would
'revert' to Argentina by the year 2000 through peaceful diplomacy and by
convincing the islanders to accept Argentine rule.
However, Mrs Sharon Halford, a Falklands councillor, said: 'I don't think
this would be viewed very favourably. Money is not everything. If they
bought someone out, where would they go?'
Mr Di Tella denied that payments would be made to encourage people to leave
the Falklands and settle elsewhere. He said, 'We want to be very respectful
of these 2,000 people. They have lived there for a long time and have a
special way of life, and if necessary we are ready to consider monetary
compensation for the psychological disturbance' of ceding sovereignty.

Court's president and its No 3 judge on Saturday after finding them guilty
of soliciting bribes from a suspect in return for protecting him from
extradition.
