Ivory Coast's main opposition leader was arrested with hundreds of
supporters yesterday when an anti-government march degenerated into the
worst rioting seen in the west African country, Reuter reports from Abidjan.
Mr Laurent Gbagbo, leader of the Popular Front, was detained at a military
camp with other opposition leaders. Mr Alassane Ouattara, the prime
minister, said that they were held because the opposition had failed to
control the marchers, estimated at about 20,000.
