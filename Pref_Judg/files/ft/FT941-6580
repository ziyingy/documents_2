The government yesterday came under pressure to shed light on the Serious
Fraud Office inquiry into Butte Mining, the UK-quoted company which is
seeking to sue former managers and promoters for alleged fraud.
Mr Rhodri Morgan, MP for Cardiff West, is also planning to write a letter to
the attorney general demanding an early conclusion to the investigation,
which was begun in June 1992. Mr Morgan will be seeking a guarantee that
there will be no political interference in the the inquiry.
Mr Morgan's action follows a written question in the House of Commons to the
attorney general requesting information on the investigation into Butte and
related matters. The attorney general replied that the inquiry was 'a
complex matter involving several foreign jurisdictions'. However, it was
being 'pursued rigorously', he said.
Butte is seeking damages of Dollars 975m from former advisers, executives,
and shareholders. One of the defendants in the litigation is Mr Roy Bichan,
former chairman of Butte Mining and currently deputy chairman of the Welsh
Development Agency.
