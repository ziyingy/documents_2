The World Bank has approved an innovative Dollars 117.8m loan to India to
support cataract surgery aimed at restoring sight to more than 8m people by
the year 2000.
The loan illustrates a shift in the bank's development strategy towards
projects likely to provide tangible benefits for poor and disadvantaged
people.
'This loan marks a watershed,' said Ms Maria Donoso Clark, manager of the
bank's cataract project. Apart from the international effort to eradicate
river blindness, a disease cause by parasites, this was the first project
supported by a multilateral agency specifically aimed at combatting
blindness.
Reducing blindness would provide economic as well as social benefits because
25 per cent of people afflicted by cataracts were aged 45-60 and still
productive. However, it was not a project likely to be financed by the
private sector, she said.
About a third of an estimated global blind population of 35m live in India.
About 13m Indians are blind in both eyes, mainly because of cataracts; a
further 10m are blind in one eye. Indians, especially women and members of
remote tribal populations, are thought to be especially prone to cataracts
as a result of malnutrition and excessive exposure to the sun.
The loan - provided by the International Development Association, the bank's
concessional arm - will meet 90 per cent of the cost of an Indian government
programme to restore sight by treating a backlog of cataract cases. The
project will involve recruiting and training about 360 surgeons and about
1,700 nurses and other support staff.
The project represents one of the largest collaborative ventures between the
Indian central and state governments and the voluntary and private sectors.
The bank credit will, for example, provide seed money to enable private
ophthalmic surgeons to establish practices in poor remote areas and urban
slums.
