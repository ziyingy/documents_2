A West Bank settler rabbi was yesterday accused of being themastermind of an
alleged violent anti-Arab underground movement based in the Hebron area, and
charged with publishing racist material, conspiracy to purchase weapons, and
other crimes.
Rabbi Ido Elba, who lives in Kiryat Arba, the Jewish settlement overlooking
Hebron where Baruch Goldstein, perpetrator of February's Hebron mosque
massacre, also was a resident, is the fourth member of the alleged
underground to be charged. His lawyer, Mr Naftali Wurzburger, said the rabbi
made no secret of his views on killing Arabs 'if it spares your own people,'
but argued that merely to hold those views was no crime.
On Wednesday, two other Kiryat Arba residents, brothers Eitan and Yehoyada
Kahalani, were charged with attempted murder.
More than a dozen people, most of them from Kiryat Arba, have been arrested
in connection with the alleged underground movement over the past month. The
members of the network may have been responsible for four murders of Arabs
in the past year, and may have been planning an attack on the PLO's orient
house headquarters in Jerusalem.
However, more than half of those originally detained have been released. In
addition, settler leaders have been charging that no extremist Jewish
underground really exists. They claim the government has deliberately used
agents of the Shin Bet security services to target right-wing settler groups
which oppose its peace policies.
With the Cave of the Patriarchs, where Goldstein gunned down 29 Palestinians
at prayer, scheduled to finally reopen later this month, the government is
keen to minimise the threat from settler extremists.
Earlier this week, 18 settlers were issued with orders banning them from
visiting the Hebron shrine.
