Two-thirds of the City of London's famous Anglican churches would cease to
be used for regular worship under recommendations published yesterday.
A City Churches Commission chaired by Lord Templeman, a law lord, concludes
that plans by the Rt Rev David Hope, bishop of London, to make the church's
ministry and mission more effective will not be fulfilled while so many
resources are devoted to a 'fruitless attempt' to maintain all the City
churches as separate entities.
The commission proposes that there should be four parish churches in the
Square Mile. A further eight would remain in active use with full-time
incumbents.
There is, says the report, no demand for a remaining 26 and they would
become 'reserve' churches. Some might be 'locked up and merely maintained
wind and water tight'. Others could be used for ecumenical, philanthropic or
cultural purposes.
The commission recommends that St Ethelburga, destroyed in last year's
Bishopsgate bombing, should not be rebuilt. It says arguments that failure
to rebuild St Ethelburga would constitute a victory for the IRA are
'emotional and fallacious', and that many churches destroyed by war and fire
are not rebuilt.
Previous attempts to rationalise the City churches have failed, but recent
deterioration in the Church of England's finances make it probable that
action will be taken this time.
Under the commission's proposals City clergy would, as incumbents retire, be
appointed on five-year contracts. A new senior post of City dean would be
created.
