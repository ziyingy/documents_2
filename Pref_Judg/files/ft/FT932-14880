A method of turning sludge from sewage treatment plants into agricultural
compost has been developed by the French company Leas, of Saint-Ismier.
The first phase of the process is to extract the sludge and remove most of
the water and then add this to bark, sawdust and household waste to improve
the consistency and increase the proportion of carbon. Air is then
circulated through the mixture to create oxidation so that the organic
matter breaks down. The mixing and oxidation process is computer-controlled
and can be remotely monitored using a modem and telephone line. Leas:
