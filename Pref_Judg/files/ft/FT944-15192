Euro Disney, the France-based European theme park operator, is launching a
substantial advertising offensive, writes Andrew Jack in Paris.
It will spend three times as much over the next 12 months as it did in the
last year on television advertising in its most important markets, including
France and the UK, and will boost coverage in Germany and the Low Countries.
More money will also be spent on radio and newspapers advertising.
Mr Philippe Bourguignon, chairman, said the company had decided to defend
itself against attacks on it in the run-up to a broad financial
restructuring.
He also confirmed that Euro Disney would be holding back work on its second
park, next to the existing one, until after it had met its target to become
profitable in 1996.
Parc Asterix, the Paris-based theme park competitor to EuroDisneyLand,
reported a one-third increase in the number of visitors during its 1994
season, to 1.55m.
The park, which is backed by Barclays Bank and Compagnie Generale des Eaux,
among others, said it had broken into profit this year for the first time
with FFr15m (Dollars 2.9m) following heavy start-up costs since opening in
1989.
