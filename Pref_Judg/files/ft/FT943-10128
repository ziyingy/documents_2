Jupiter bears the dark scars of last month's cometary bombardment. Any
amateur astronomer with a telescope can see a band of bold black marks
across the giant planet, some as large as Earth.
The 21 fragments of comet Shoemaker-Levy 9 also made a powerful impact on
the public imagination - partly because professional astronomers had
prepared the ground well, for example laying on press conferences to brief
the media about what some predicted would be the greatest cosmic spectacle
since the invention of the telescope. Fortunately the show lived up to the
advance billing.
Why did it arouse so much interest and excitement? Although the television
pictures were impressive, showing fireballs and debris rising hundreds of
miles above Jupiter's thin atmosphere, we have seen more spectacular views
from space. Think of the close-ups of Saturn's twisted rings taken by the
two Voyager spacecraft in the 1980s, let alone man's first steps on the moon
25 years ago.
And for us as individuals, what we see in the heavens with our own eyes  -
for example an unexpected shower of shooting stars or the flicker of the
Northern lights - surpasses in beauty and visual impact anything we
experience through the electronic media.
The great appeal of Shoemaker-Levy lay in the event's unscripted cosmic
violence, spiced by imagining what would have happened if the series of
kilometre-sized rocks had hit here instead of Jupiter. They would have wiped
out most life on Earth, just like the giant meteorite that is believed to
have ended the dinosaur era 65m years ago when it left a crater stretching
180km across what is now Mexico's Yucatan peninsula.
The dark marks smeared across Jupiter's southern hemisphere are dust and/or
soot thrown into the upper atmosphere by the explosion of the cometary
fragments. Astronomers expect them to persist for many months. On Earth,
that much smoke and dust would plunge the whole planet into a sunless, icy
'impact winter'. As human agriculture and natural food chains collapsed, few
living creatures could escape starving or freezing to death.
Earth is a far smaller target than Jupiter; its surface area is 100 times
less and it weighs 300 times less. But the bombardment of Jupiter has
strengthened the hands of those who argue that we are at greater risk of
destruction by an aberrant asteroid or comet than astronomers had believed -
and that we should be doing something to protect ourselves.
Over the past 20 years or so, the view that Earth's history is punctuated by
cosmic cataclysms has moved from the bizarre sidelines of astronomical
theory to the mainstream. A respectable estimate now is that for an average
American or European the likelihood of dying because a comet or asteroid
hits Earth is similar to the chance of being killed in an air crash: about 1
in 20,000.
In Washington, the Shoemaker-Levy show has convinced doubting politicians
that the risk is real - not just a ploy by astronomers to extract federal
funds. Congressmen are rallying to support plans to spend Dollars 250m over
the next 20 years on an early warning network of telescopes. The proposed
Spaceguard system would map the estimated 1,000 to 2,000 asteroids and
comets whose paths may cross Earth's orbit around the sun.
Spaceguard would give warning times of impact with Earth ranging from
several decades for an asteroid with a circular orbit to perhaps a year for
a comet with a highly elliptical orbit. That might or might not be long
enough to send a rocket to detonate a nuclear weapon and deflect the
intruder into a non-threatening path.
However, for the thousands of astronomers, amateur and professional, who
observed the Jovian bombardment and are watching its aftermath, the
implications for Earth are very much a secondary consideration. They are
interested above all in learning as much as possible from the collisions
about the nature of Jupiter and of comets.
Few firm scientific conclusions have emerged yet from the vast mass of
observations. Previous space spectaculars, such Voyager's planetary fly-by
and Giotto's encounter with Halley's Comet, were based on specific
spacecraft, co-ordinated by mission controllers. The Shoemaker-Levy
collision, in contrast, is a free-for-all with no one in charge.
An unprecedent amount of data flew around the world's computer networks
during the bombardment, as astronomers exchanged the latest news by
electronic mail; indeed the event was said to have caused the first serious
jam on Internet. The lines are now humming with preliminary thoughts about
what to make of it all.
Key questions still to be answered include: how deeply the comet's fragments
penetrated Jupiter's atmosphere before they exploded; whether they arrived
as solid lumps or as loose aggregates of ice and rock; and what chemicals
were thrown into the upper atmosphere from the lower levels.
Shoemaker-Levy may have faded from the headlines but its marks on Jupiter
are proving longer lasting than astronomers had predicted. For Earth, its
legacy will be a better understanding of planetary science and - conceivably
 -an early warning system to save us all from a cosmic cataclysm.
