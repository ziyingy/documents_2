The Euro Disney creditor banks plan to hold a special meeting in Paris on
January 26 to discuss their strategy in the negotiations to produce a
financial rescue package for the stricken leisure group.
The banks, which have formed a steering committee to orchestrate the
restructuring led by Banque Nationale de Paris and Banque Indosuez, have
commissioned an investigative audit of Euro Disney's finances from KPMG Peat
Marwick, the accounting and consultancy group.
KPMG is expected by the end of today to produce a preliminary report on Euro
Disney, but will present the banks with a full audit at the January 26
meeting. It is also analysing Euro Disney's business plan to assess whether
the banks should demand changes in personnel and strategy.
The 60 international banks that hold Euro Disney's FFr20.3bn (Dollars
3.47bn) net debt are scheduled to attend the Paris meeting. The banks
include JP Morgan, Citibank, Deutsche Bank, Credit Suisse, Barclays,
National Westminster, Mitsubishi Trust and Bank of Tokyo.
One bank recently sold a FFr130m parcel of Euro Disney debt at 60 per cent
of its original value on the 'second hand' market. Three other creditors are
considering offers to sell their loans, according to New York analysts, but
are at present unwilling to sell for as little as 60 per cent.
Euro Disney and Walt Disney, its US parent company, have already outlined
proposals for the banks to halve the ailing leisure group's debt through the
combination of a rights issue and debt-for-equity swap. Walt Disney has
promised to provide financial support for Euro Disney until March 31, but
will then withdraw if the banks have not agreed terms. Euro Disney would
then go bankrupt.
