'1992-93 was a bad year for Quadrant,' Lord Rees, chairman of the
photographic and video equipment company, said yesterday as he reported
doubled attributable losses of Pounds 16.2m, against Pounds 8.44m
previously.
At the pre-tax level the year to February 28 suffered losses of Pounds 7.27m
(1.41m profit).
In Quadrant's continuing activities, operating losses grew to Pounds 2.6m
(Pounds 800,000) on turnover of Pounds 48.9m (Pounds 45.4m). Lord Rees
ascribed this to 'the internal upheavals within the group,' and 'the deep
recession in the UK economy.' The video systems and processing businesses
were particularly badly affected.
Extraordinary charges of Pounds 9.18m (Pounds 10.5m) included a Pounds 8.2m
write-down of the company's two liquid petroleum gas ships. They were
acquired in 1991 from a company controlled by Mr Robert Brothers, Lord Rees'
predecessor.
Mr David Coghlan, who became chief executive in December after he and Mr
Jean-Marc Cangardel, his partner, bought a 25 per cent stake for Pounds
1.2m, said his first action had been to dismantle the nascent internal
merger between the two divisions and Leeds Photovisual and Imagesenter.
The merger contributed Pounds 2.11m to exceptional charges of Pounds 3.3m
(Pounds 307,000), and its Pounds 101,000 dismantling costs swelled the
extraordinaries.
No dividend is proposed. In 1991-92, a total dividend of 4p was paid,
including a final of 2.35p.
Losses per share were 25.96p (6.87p earnings).
