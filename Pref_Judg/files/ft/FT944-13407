It is probably fair to say that Morocco has never been seen by the world in
general in a more favourable light in all its long and proud history than
now.
Contrast helps, of course. Compared with the brutal civil violence and
near-anarchy of neighbouring Algeria, Morocco stands out for its stability,
cohesion, economic growth and relative liberalism.
This was not always so. Twenty years ago, the longevity of its monarchical
system was open to doubt after two attempts on King Hassan II's life. Ten
years ago, it was in deep financial trouble, leaning on the International
Monetary Fund to steer it through a gradual adjustment process.
The king, 33 years on the throne, has proved a shrewd if stern helmsman  -
and also a statesman, through the role he has played over the years, mostly
behind the scenes, in promoting Arab-Israeli conciliation. It is an implicit
recognition of this role that the international conference on economic
development following the Israeli-Palestinian peace agreements is being
staged in Casablanca, starting this Sunday.
As for the economy, annual growth has averaged 4 per cent over the past
decade. This year, with abundant rain producing a bumper cereal crop, growth
is expected to reach 10 or 11 per cent, after stagnating in 1993 in the
second successive year of drought. Inflation is holding at around 5 per
cent.
Morocco has come through its debt restructuring, and although debt servicing
takes up 30 per cent of the annual budget, the public sector deficit has
fallen from 12 per cent of gross domestic product in the early 1980s to 2
per cent last year. This year the figure is expected to rise slightly to 2.5
per cent.
Starting last year, Morocco embarked on privatisation of a scope comparable
only with that of some Latin American countries. Reservations about losing
the state's grip on public utilities and strategic sectors are progressively
being overcome. The long-dormant stock market in Casablanca can today claim
to be the biggest, in terms of capitalisation, in the African continent
outside South Africa. Foreign investment is expected to reach a record level
this year.
Government planners say the country can count on average growth of 4.5 per
cent over the next few years. But for Mr Omar Kabbaj, a former IMF official
who in the present interim government of non-party technocrats holds the
wonderful title of 'minister in charge of stimulation of the economy', that
is not enough. The country needs to step up a gear to keep pace with the
demand for jobs.
Mr Kabbaj has set an ambitious objective of 6.5-7 per cent a year, including
in that target a 15 per cent annual increase in exports of finished
products. These expectations rely heavily on the private sector, although
Morocco has few private sector companies of any size by international
standards.
Around the beginning of this year, Morocco's population of at least 27m is
reckoned to have passed the threshold of being more than 50 per cent urban,
the result of a secular process of migration from the Saharan regions to the
rich Atlantic plains and from the countryside to the cities.
Urban unemployment now stands at around 16 per cent. In the farming areas
the rate is sometimes more, sometimes less, depending on the vagaries of the
climate. Population growth, although it has slowed, is running at 2 per cent
annually. There are expected to be a quarter of a million new arrivals on
the job market each year.
Though subject to periodic manifestations of discontent, Morocco has been
shielded from the kind of radical Islamic movement that has torn Algeria
apart and affected other countries in the region. Moroccan officials are
ever-anxious to underline the country's 'specificity' in this respect.
Essential to this 'specificity' are the religious credentials of the king
himself as a descendant of the Prophet Mohammed.
As a symbol of this role as 'Commander of the Believers' stands the
extraordinary new Hassan II mosque, dominating the Casablanca waterfront, a
lavish enterprise which took 10,000 craftsmen six years to build,
constructed on piles over the water, including a men's prayer area with room
for 20,000 and underfloor heating, and a sliding roof weighing 1,100 tonnes.
Criticism over its extravagance has subsided; most people seem proud of
having it.
Privately, however, senior Moroccan officials admit deep concern about the
implications of developments in Algeria. Neither the emergence of a
fundamentalist state in Algeria, nor the disintegration of Algeria as a
nation, could avoid having a profound impact on Morocco.
With its powerful interior ministry, Morocco keeps its own fundamentalist
groups under fairly heavy-handed control. Mr Abdessalam Yassine, leader of
Justice and Charity, the chief radical Islamic organisation, is under house
arrest, and no party would be allowed to contest elections under an Islamic
banner. Religious causes are mostly represented on the political scene by
Istiqlal, the old national independence party.
Moroccan sensitivity was shown up by the eruption of tensions between the
two countries in August after a shooting incident in Marrakesh in which two
Spanish tourists died. Rabat hastily imposed visa requirements on anyone of
Algerian nationality or origin. Algiers responded by closing the border. The
favoured theory in official Moroccan circles is that Algeria's secret
service was behind the attack.
The Algerian press has accused Morocco of turning a blind eye to weapons
crossing into Algeria, destined for armed Islamic groups crossing the
border. Many Algerians feel deep resentment towards Morocco, suspecting it
of playing a game to win the consent of a future Algerian Islamic government
to Rabat's sovereignty over the former Spanish Sahara.
Senior officials say Morocco needs to strengthen its 'antibodies against
contagion' from Algeria. These defences are twofold. One is economic growth
and wider participation in the country's wealth. The other is liberalisation
of its politics. The system that the king, now 65, will hand over to his
heir, Crown Prince Sidi Mohammed, will be considerably less undemocratic
than it was a few years ago.
All the strings of authority continue to be controlled, ultimately, by the
royal palace. But parliament - comprising a recondite collection of parties
 -has had its powers strengthened. It can send back budgets, question
ministers and bring up issues such as human rights.
More than 400 political prisoners were amnestied in July. Foreign experts
say there remain about 50 political detainees, mostly fundamentalists.
Newspapers these days sometimes show surprising freedom - the weekly
L'Economiste being an example of a new era in the Moroccan press.
Following a recent policy turnaround, the three Berber languages may now be
taught in state schools alongside Arabic, something Berber cultural
associations had long struggled for. Women's rights, although more
restricted than in Tunisia, have improved.
Opening parliament this month, the king repeated an offer made twice before
to left-wing and nationalist opposition parties, which were strengthened in
elections last year, to give them most of the cabinet posts and negotiate
alliances to form a parliamentary majority. The parties had previously
refused the conditions. This time the king, seeking 'alternation' in
government, added the offer of the premiership, held since May by Mr
Abdellatif Filali, a veteran diplomat. A new government could emerge by the
end of the year.
Whatever its shape, the government can be expected to press ahead with
efforts to liberalise and modernise the economy. But real political change
is likely to come at a slower pace.
