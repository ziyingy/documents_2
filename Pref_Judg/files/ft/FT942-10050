Johnson Fry is hoping to raise up to Pounds 100m with a split capital
investment trust specialising in European utility companies.
There will be two classes of share. The zero dividend preference, with an
equivalent gross annual rate of 9.46 per cent, will account for 29 per cent
of the capital at launch.
Ordinary income shares will account for 71 per cent and aim to provide an
initial yield of 6 per cent.
They will also have some entitlement to capital gains at the end of the
trust's planned 10-year life, after the zeros' entitlement has been met.
The public offer for the income shares closes on June 7, and that for the
zeros on June 9.
First dealings are expected on June 20.
