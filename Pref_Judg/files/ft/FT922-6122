NIPPON Yusen (NYK) and Mitsui OSK Lines, Japan's two biggest shipping
companies, have reported lower pre-tax earnings for 1991-92, but expect
profits to increase this year.
In contrast, their three closest domestic competitors - Kawasaki Kisen
Kaisha, Navix Line and Showa Line - all posted sharp profits gains for the
year ended March 1992.
Reduced interest payments helped boost the profitability of Kawasaki, Navix
and Showa, although the latter two expect lower earnings this year.
Both NYK and Mitsui OSK blamed their earnings declines on foreign exchange
losses.
NYK's pre-tax profits dropped by 2.7 per cent to Y14.1bn (Dollars 109.3m),
although sales rose by 6.8 per cent to Y569bn due to a recovery in liner and
tramper operations. Net profits rose 26.8 per cent to Y6.5bn due to lower
taxes. The dividend was unchanged at Y4.
NYK predicts that pre-tax profits in the current year will rise 6.1 per cent
to Y15bn, while sales will increase 3.7 per cent to Y590bn due to its recent
takeover of Nippon Liner System. Net profits are expected to decrease by 8.1
per cent to Y6bn.
Mitsui's pre-tax profits fell by 31.7 per cent to Y7.4bn, although sales
rose by 5.5 per cent to Y480.9bn. It noted that liner operations to Europe
had returned to profitability, while losses on North American routes were
halved due to increased shipments of consumer products.
Net profit fell by 60.9 per cent to Y2.3bn, but the dividend was left
unchanged at Y4.
Mitsui expects sales in fiscal 1992 to rise to Y500bn as the liner
operations improve to the break-even point with growing shipments of raw
materials. Pre-tax profits will also increase to Y10bn, while net profit
will reach Y5bn.
Kawasaki was the only top Japanese shipping company to record an increase in
sales and pre-tax profits. It expects the upward trend to continue this
fiscal year.
Navix and Showa had lower sales, reflecting reduced rates for tankers and
iron-ore tramps. But their pre-tax profits rose. Navix attributed the 166
per cent increase in pre-tax earnings to Y3.4bn to the dividends received in
return for the sale of ships.
Navix and Showa expect the situation to be reversed this year, with higher
sales but lower pre-tax profits.
