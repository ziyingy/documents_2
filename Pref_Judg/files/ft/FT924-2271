FOREIGN exchange dealers, uneasy about loss of earnings, rebelled against
the prospect of European monetary union during the currency market turmoil
that climaxed on September 16, the deputy director of the Bank of Italy
argues in an article published today.
According to Mr Tommaso Padoa-Schioppa, the epicentre of the rebellion in
dealing rooms was London, where it interacted with 'the unresolved
reservations of British political circles and public opinion' about
relinquishing the exchange rate as a policy variable and the Queen's head on
the pound as a sign of national identity.
'It was almost as if, after years of subjugation to the idea that EMU had
become inevitable, the plethora of dealing room professionals earning their
money from exchange rate movements rebelled against the prospect of seeing
their shops closed, irrevocably locked, by a decree that would cancel a
whole set of rows and columns from the matrix of world exchange rates,' says
the article.
Mr Padoa-Schioppa's view, which appears in the London Business School's
latest International Economic Outlook, is that the European exchange rate
mechanism ultimately gave way to the tension created by four
hard-to-reconcile goals of the European Community - free trade, full capital
mobility, fixed exchange rates and national autonomy.
He argues that 'a much earlier passage to the third phase, if need be by a
group of countries, is the only truly structural solution to the
inconsistent quartet'.
