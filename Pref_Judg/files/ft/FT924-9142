so the message from the catwalks comes out loud and clear - it is a fine bit
of timing the Nice Irma's, that dearly loved London store of the '70s hippy,
looks even nicer today.
There is still a goodly sprinkling of Indian bedspreads, of quilted bags
that look as if they came straight from Mysore (and nothing wrong with that
either), of crewelwork cushion covers and Ikat prints, but there is also
marvellously priced ticking fabric (six different colourways) at Pounds 6.70
a metre and six different plaids (currently all the rage) at Pounds 7.50 a
metre.
Those who bought their '70s props from Nice Irma's will need no reminding
that the shop is at 46 Goodge Street, London W1P 1FJ. Those for whom Nice
Irma's is unknown have a treat in store. There is no need any longer to make
it to Goodge Street, for there is now a bright, well-produced full-colour
mail order catalogue which makes all its wares available to everybody,
wherever they may be.
From the beds and quilts to a range of very well-priced rugs (the smallest
at 24 ins by 36 ins is just Pounds 12.70, the largest at 60 ins by 90 ins is
Pounds 69) everything can be ordered from home without braving the
metropolis. There are all the usual Indian finds - the wrought-iron
candlesticks, the painted boxes, the gilt mirrors, the wooden artefacts, all
at very reasonable prices.
However, probably the best value of all are the fabrics, all of which come
from India, all hand-loomed or hand-worked. The range is wide, the prices
excellent and for those who quail at the prices of furnishing fabric in the
designer shops it is good to know that there is somewhere to go for fabrics
at well under Pounds 10 a metre. Nice Irma's also makes up cushions, blinds,
curtains, bedspreads and lampshades to order, at affordable prices.
Catalogues cost Pounds 2 from Nice Irma's, 46, Goodge Street, London W1P
1FJ.
