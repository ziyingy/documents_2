The European Commission and Japan open two days of annual trade talks today
with an initiative to study deregulation of the Japanese economy high on the
agenda, Reuter reports from Brussels.
The Commission said the meeting would focus on access to the Japanese market
and would also review Japanese and EU relations with the US.
