China's Communist Party, in a frank admission of its declining influence in
the countryside, has issued a circular ordering local officials to abide
strictly by central economic directives or face punishment, Reuter reports
from Beijing.
The party's commission for discipline said Beijing's attempts to ensure
orderly economic growth were being undermined as local officials flout
orders.
