Two Palestinians died yesterday and two were wounded in a spate of incidents
in Jericho, Gaza and the occupied West Bank which threw a shadow over
continuing attempts to advance the Israeli-Palestinian peace process. In
Jericho, now under Palestinian rule, gunmen shot dead Ibrahim Yogi, a
27-year-old member of the armed wing of the Islamic Hamas organisation after
running him over with a car bearing Israeli licence plates. Hamas blamed
Israeli undercover agents and called a general strike but Israeli officials
denied involvement. Any such operation, they said, would have been a blatant
undermining of Palestinian authority. In Gaza, an Israeli naval patrol shot
and wounded two Palestinian boatmen fishing outside the permitted area,
which stretches 20 miles off the coast of the autonomous enclave. Under the
peace accord, Israel maintains narrow security zones opposite the Egyptian
and Israeli borders at either end of the strip. A military spokesman
explained: 'If boatmen do not obey orders to leave the zone, we have to
assume they are either smuggling arms or planning to attack Israeli
targets.' In Hebron on the West Bank, Eid Abdel-Mohsem al-Saghair, 19, died
in when a bomb he was carrying blew up in his hands, said the Israeli army.
