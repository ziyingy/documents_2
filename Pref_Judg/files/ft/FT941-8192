Kohl to galvanise CDU
Mr Helmut Kohl, the man who brought Germany unification, continues his
Christian Democratic Union's election campaign at the party conference in

return to the familiarity and security of the ruling coalition at national,
rather than local, elections; and his own ruthless political instincts in a
frantic election year. There are 19 separate elections ahead, leading up to
the general election on October 16. The conference ends today.
