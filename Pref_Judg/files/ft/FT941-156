Ms Clare Spottiswoode, director-general of Ofgas, the gas regulator,
yesterday accused her predecessor of acting 'illegally' in allowing the
costs of energy-efficiency projects to be passed on to customers.
Her concerns, which she said arose 'in the first week' of her appointment in
November, were made to the Commons environment select committee yesterday.
Mr Robert Jones MP, the Conservative chairman of the committee, accused her
of making 'a robust condemnation' of Sir James McKinnon.
The controversy - which surfaced when Ms Spottiswoode gave evidence to the
trade and industry select committee in January - is over whether gas and
electricity customers should pay for projects initiated by the Energy Saving
Trust.
The trust is intended to help the utilities identify ways in which their
customers can save energy. Ms Spottiswoode's concern is that the trust will
need to spend in the region of Pounds 300m to Pounds 400m a year by the end
of the decade to meet government targets. This could add several per cent to
household fuel bills, on top of the controversial imposition of value added
tax announced in last year's Budget.
The trust was featured prominently by Mr John Major, the prime minister, in
the UK's strategy for combating global warming.
Mr Andrew Warren, director of the Association for the Conservation of
Energy, said: 'Until this problem is solved it is hard to see how Mr Major's
strategy is on the road.'
Mr Jones argued that there was 'a clear difference of opinion' between Ms
Spottiswoode and Professor Stephen Littlechild, her counterpart at Offer,
the electricity regulator.
Offer said yesterday: 'We are confident that we have acted totally legally
in formulating our supply price control.
'We will look at Clare Spottiswoode's comments to the environment select
committee with interest.'
