If those geniuses at Sears Roebuck, JC Penney and Montgomery Ward (those
pioneers who had the bright idea that people might buy goods through the
post) could see us now, they would be astonished. Once mail order was just
for the utilitarian and the everyday. Today you would be hard pushed to
think up anything that you could not buy by mail.
At Christmas, mail order comes into its own. Forget the forays into bleak
car-parks, the crowded shops, the over-heated shops and the battle to get
the parcels home. There is still time to order the catalogues, sort through
the lists and get everything delivered on time.
These days few catalogues come with a cover price - they flutter out from
almost every magazine and newspaper in the land - but for anybody whose
doormat has been neglected here are some of the best of the commercial ones
around.

small Shaker hanging cupboard at Pounds 299 is especially charming, so, too,
