The EU agreement on steel restructuring, once formally approved, paves the
way for two other separate agreements, writes Andrew Hill. One is on a new
structure for aid to the Union's coal industry, due to come into force on
December 31, and another on the directive opening up competition in the oil
and gas exploration sector. Before the steel pact was struck, Italy had been
holding up these other two proposals in an attempt to persuade Germany to
agree on the steel package.
