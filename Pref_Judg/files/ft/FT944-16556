Norwegian oil and natural gas producers Statoil and Norsk Hydro yesterday
announced they would invest in a natural gas pipeline in Germany. The
agreement, signed with Germany's Ruhrgas, the biggest German gas importer,
and BEB, Germany's biggest producer of gas, establishes a new company,
Netra. Netra will complete and operate a large-diameter pipeline requiring a
total investment of over DM1bn (Dollars 650m). The agreement comes just two
weeks after the completion of a competitive pipeline transmission system,
jointly owned by Gasprom of Russia and Wintershall of Germany, and
intensifies the battle between Norway and Russia over new European gas
supplies. Netra will build a 290km pipeline between Etzel, near
Wilhelmshaven in Germany, and Saltzwedel on Germany's former east-west
border.
The companies said their co-operation would increase natural gas supply
volumes from Norway to Germany and central Europe. Netra believes the
pipeline will be an important link in the growing European gas grid
integrating the gas industries of western, central and eastern Europe by a
cross-border pipeline network.
