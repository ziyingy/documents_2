Sir, Dr Popham, in his letter 'Best for France and Europe if franc floats'
(April 5), accuses me of misinformation. He predicts 'a small fall followed
by a gradual rise'. Real interest rates should be 3 per cent or, for France
with 2.5 per cent inflation, 5.5 per cent as compared with 10.5 per cent
short term now. What a wondrous world it would be where interest rates could
be halved and there would only be 'a small fall' in the value of the franc]
This is just a technical point. Also Dr Popham wonders why France would link
its currency with the sick German economy. It is because France is now an
integral part of a currency block three quarters the size of the US (in
terms of GNP), if we just include France, Germany, the Netherlands and
Belgium.
Furthermore, it is well proven that strong currencies lead to strong export
performance, as shown by Germany and Japan, and a weak currency to poor
performance, as shown by the UK. But most important of all is burden
sharing. Devaluation would make it even more difficult for Germany to get
out of the recession and successfully complete unification.
Also, not too long ago the UK wanted the pound to become the strongest
currency in Europe. France wants the same, but that takes time; it takes a
long time for France to wear down its reputation as being prone to
devaluation. France has come a long way. Floating now would throw away
sacrifices already made.
Finally, floating the franc would delay the introduction of a common
European currency, the most powerful tool for increasing European trade and
prosperity.
