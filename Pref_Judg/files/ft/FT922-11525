A US SATELLITE has found gigantic ripples of matter near the edge of the
universe. The discovery promises to explain how stars and galaxies evolved
from the Big Bang - the cataclysmic explosion that created everything about
15bn years ago.
The finding, announced last night at a meeting of the American Physical
Society in Washington, is the most important event in cosmology since 1964,
when scientists detected a faint after-glow of the Big Bang.
'What we have found is evidence for the birth of the universe,' said Mr
George Smoot of the University of California at Berkeley, who led the
National Aeronautics and Space Administration team that made the discovery.
The Cosmic Background Explorer (Cobe) spacecraft, launched in 1989, has
detected variations within the after-glow. These arose from fluctuations in
the universe one-trillionth (million-millionth) of a second after its
creation.
The discovery points the way to a solution to one of the greatest puzzles in
science: how did matter that was uniformly spread in the original Big Bang
start clumping together to produce stars, galaxies and clusters of galaxies?
Professor Michael Turner, a University of Chicago physicist at the
Washington meeting, said the significance of the Cobe find 'cannot be
overstated - they have found the Holy Grail of cosmology'.
Mr Smoot said the ripples, which are very wispy clouds of matter, were the
largest and most ancient structures in the universe, stretching across
billions of light-years of space and dating back about 15bn years to when
the universe was just 300,000 years old
The ripples were created by the universe's rapid expansion after the Big
Bang. Then gravity made increasing amounts of matter clump together,
eventually creating galaxies and stars.
Evidence collected by the satellite after 300 million measurements of
background radiation from the Big Bang also supports the theory that up to
90 per cent of the universe is invisible 'dark matter' which scientists have
not been able to identify, Nasa said. The temperatures and sizes of the
variations in the radiation agree with a theory called 'inflationary
cosmology', which explains how minute fluctuations after the Big Bang
created the pattern of the universe as we know it.
