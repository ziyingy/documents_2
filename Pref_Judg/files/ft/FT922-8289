Nigerian students, angered by chronic fuel shortages, smashed cars during a
rampage in a crowded, working-class area of Lagos yesterday, Reuter reports
from Lagos.
There were no immediate reports of clashes with riot police, who took up
positions near Lagos University and in other areas late on Tuesday after
student leaders called for two days of protests against the fuel shortage in
the oil-producing country and to air other grievances.
Other witnesses said police turned back scores of vehicles from Oshodi. Some
drivers, who made it through the area, had green leaves on their cars to
show solidarity with the students.
The military government earlier ordered the deployment of troops to help end
fuel shortages in Nigeria caused mainly by cross-border smuggling and
hoarding.
Defence Headquarters, quoted by state radio, ordered special border patrols
to stop smuggling, escorts for tankers and the immediate closure of all
petrol stations within 25km (16 miles) of Nigeria's land frontiers.
