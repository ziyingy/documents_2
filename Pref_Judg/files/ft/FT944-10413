Coffee fell in London yesterday when estimates by the Brazilian government
of the extent of damage to next year's crop disappointed traders by being in
line with their expectations. Prices had been bid up in trading earlier this
week following rumours that crop damage was much greater than had previously
been anticipated.
The January futures contract slipped Dollars 62 to Dollars 3,506 a tonne on
the London Commodity Exchange as the New York market also slowed. By midday,
coffee futures at the Coffee, Sugar and Cocoa Exchange had slipped by 2
cents a pound to Dollars 1.87.
The Brazilian government has estimated the 1995-1996 coffee crop at between
12.7m and 14.8m bags (60kg each) following two frosts and a prolonged
drought. Government officials said the drought was likely to cause the crop
to shrink 25 to 30 per cent on top of damage already wrought by the frosts.
After the frosts, government estimates put the crop at a minimum of 15.7m
bags compared with the 26.5m bags which had been expected before.
Even though the fall in the Brazilian crop will exacerbate tightness in
world supplies by the middle of next year, analysts say the market is well
supplied.
'There is plenty of coffee around right now. Sentiment in the market is
turning bearish and there is a risk the market could drop sharply,' said Ms
Judy Ganes, commodities analyst at Merrill Lynch in New York.
Brazilian officials said output was not likely to return to normal until
1997.
