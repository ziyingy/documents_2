The International Maritime Organisation, the United Nations agency for
shipping, yesterday ordered a top-level inquiry into the safety of vehicle
ferries following the loss of more than 900 lives in the Estonia disaster.
The inquiry was announced as Sweden's National Maritime Board said the
Estonia may have sunk because its outer bow door was ripped off in a storm,
allowing water to pour on to the ship's cavernous vehicle deck.
It also emerged that the Europa, one of the ships that picked up survivors
of the Estonia tragedy, suffered serious damage to its bow door in the heavy
seas that lashed the rescue fleet.
As concern about the operation of roll-on roll-off ships grew, Mr William
O'Neil, the IMO secretary-general, ordered a full safety review by the
organisation's maritime safety committee.
IMO officials said the committee would consider all aspects of roll-on
roll-off shipping at its next meeting in December at the org-anisation's
London headquarters.
No agenda has yet been drawn up, but the committee is thought certain to
consider whether bulkheads on the ships' open vehicle decks would help to
increase stability in the event of a surge of water through the doors.
Most ship owners believe bulkheads would reduce the profitability of roll-on
roll-off ships. But an IMO official said the review's 'prime consideration'
would be safety. 'The travelling public are entitled to know that economic
considerations come second,' he said.
The committee has the power to amend the 1981 international convention on
the safety of life at sea, which provides the framework for national
shipping legislation in 122 countries covering 97 per cent of world tonnage.
However, the committee is expected to produce a full report on the
implications of the Estonia disaster before deciding whether to call a
special meeting to consider changes to the convention.
Mr Bengt-Erik Stenmark, Sweden's head of maritime safety, said the joint
Estonian-Finnish-Swedish team investigating the disaster had been told by
witnesses that the visor-style outer bow door was missing when the ship
sank. 'The outer door was lost,' he said. Witnesses saw 30-35cm of water on
the car deck, enough to destabilise the vessel, he added.
Inspectors carrying out urgent checks of all roll-on roll-off ferries
calling at Swedish ports said the port bow door on the Europa, a
3,000-passenger ferry operated by the Silja Line, suffered damaged hinges
during the storm and could not be opened.
The Europa, the biggest ferry of its kind sailing in the Baltic, was allowed
to sail for Finland last night after the Finnish-based Silja Line said it
would only load the ship by its aft doors until repairs had been carried
out.
A Finnish search boat last night located the wreck of the Estonia, at a
depth of 250-280 ft, 25 miles south-west of the Finnish island of Uto. The
investigating team plans to survey the ship with remote-controlled cameras
for evidence of what caused it to sink.
Swedish inspectors plan to scrutinise over the next week all 50
passenger-carrying roll-on roll-off ferries currently calling at Swedish
ports.
