THE MYSTERY of the 'bogus' British Rail document threatening cuts to
InterCity links after privatisation was partly cleared up yesterday as it
emerged that the document was neither bogus nor, officially, British Rail,
but something in between.
The document's contents, which figured prominently in the media last week,
suggested that a privatised InterCity would inevitably seek to improve
profits by trimming links with dozens of towns and cities in outlying areas.
That posed a potential embarrassment for Mr Malcolm Rifkind, the transport
secretary, whose favoured option for the break-up of BR is the sale of the
InterCity as a single entity.
Quizzed in the Commons on Monday about the document's implications, Mr
Rifkind ducked the question by denouncing its authenticity. It had become
clear that the document was not a BR document, but a bogus one, he said.
Yesterday BR's version of events was that the document had been seen by Sir
Bob but it bore no identifying marks and its origins were unknown.
The implication is that the document, although not produced officially by
BR, was written by a senior BR employee with the intention of leaking it and
creating exactly the effect it produced.
