THE communications needs of manned missions to Mars, of jet-setting business
travellers and relief workers stranded in remote lands will be met more
easily after agreement yesterday between the world's telecommunications
authorities to allocate radio frequencies for such new services.
Representatives from 127 member-countries of the International
Telecommunication Union, meeting at the World Administrative Radio
Conference (WARC) in Torremolinos, Spain, agreed on the allocation of
frequencies for a range of communications services.
The month-long conference closed yesterday with mixed results. Agreement was
not reached on a global frequency for wide-bank high definition television
(HDTV) or for digital sound broadcasting.
However, mobile communications systems were boosted by the decision to
allocate frequencies for several types of mobile systems.
Both the satellite mobile communications services proposed by the US and
future mobile telecommunications services being advocated by the European
Community won the necessary frequencies.
The US and the EC had been at odds over the allocation of frequencies for
differing mobile communications systems. One US-based service, Iridium, a
Dollars 3.2bn (Pounds 1.8bn) project that proposed to use 77 satellites
circling the globe and was backed by Motorola, the US electronics and
telecommunications group, had to postpone the closing of a public financing
until the WARC decision gave it the frequency.
The US delegation, which was able to obtain several frequencies for its
space programmes, was particularly pleased.
Among other things, it obtained a frequency that would allow astronauts on
the moon to communicate with their spaceship and one that would allow
communications from earth with manned explorations to Mars.
'You just can't get a telephone line long enough from the earth to Mars,'
said Mr Jan Barran, head of the US delegation.
