The sinking of the Estonia, a ship 50 per cent-owned by the Estonian state
and largely crewed by Estonians, has been a severe blow to this country of
1.6m people in only its fourth year of independence.
The disaster has directly affected a larger proportion of the nation than is
the case for Sweden, where most of the victims lived, or Finland, which
played an important role in the rescue operation.
Estonians also feel that it has thrown into question the competence and
efficiency of their country's shipping industry - and its ability to break
free from the inheritance of its past in the Soviet Union, where transport
was expected to be hazardous.
A large white cross has been placed on a grassy knoll near Tallinn's
Maritime Museum, with candles burning on both sides. Memorial services will
be held throughout Estonia tomorrow.
Ms Riina Taglis, a shop manager who had come to pay her respects at the
cross, said yesterday: 'For us it is like a horror, like a time after the
war when so many people were killed.'
This parallel was also used by Mr Mart Laar, the outgoing prime minister, in
comments he made in Finland on Thursday: he recalled the number of people
who drowned in 1944, escaping to Sweden in small boats when the Red Army
came back to Estonia.
The government has set up a fund to assist the families in distress. The
Estonian Cultural Foundation has also launched an appeal to build a monument
to the memory of the victims. And the weekly Eesti Express has already
collected over 560,000 kroons (Pounds 28,000) for its appeal on behalf of
the victims' families.
In an interview yesterday with the FT, Mr Laar emphasised that early
evidence showed the sinking of the ship was not the fault of Estonian crew
or procedures. 'We got information on Thursday night that, in the past 10
years, six other serious accidents had happened to ships of this type of
construction. There were no disasters because these accidents happened in
calm weather conditions. But in a Baltic storm the disaster happened.
'What seems to have taken place, from the reports I have had, is that the
front part of the ship seemed to fall away and the water flooded in. That
could not be crew failure and the inspection in Tallinn before the ferry
failed showed no problems. Some people talk of a loud noise, as of a
collision.'
This possibility has also been raised by the testimony of one of the first
Estonian survivors to come back to Tallinn, Mr Ain-Alar Johanson. On
Thursday night, he said he had heard a 'loud, metallic noise' a little
before the ship begun to sink.
Mr Indrek Tarand, top civil servant in the Estonian foreign ministry, said:
'Even though a ship called Estonia was wrecked and went to the bottom, it
doesn't mean that Estonia collapses - though this is a catastrophe that will
be remembered for centuries.'
Mr Ivar Raig, a member of parliament for the Rural Centre party, said: 'In
the short term, people will be worried about us - we may again be seen as a
country of disasters.
'But on the other hand it can show how far we are part of another world.
This was a ship built in Germany with mixed Swedish-Estonian ownership and
the rescue operations were carried out by Swedes, Finns and Estonians. It is
a common tragedy for all of these.'
