THE SIX-YEAR moratorium on commercial whaling will come under renewed
challenge this week as 37 nations gather in Glasgow for the annual meeting
of the International Whaling Commission.
Japan, Norway and Iceland, which still have whaling industries, are pressing
for a resumption of the hunting of minke whales. They say stocks have
recovered sufficiently to permit resumed whaling in the Antarctic and in the
north-east Atlantic.
Mr John Gummer, the secretary of state for agriculture and fisheries, who is
to open the week-long meeting tomorrow, is expected to say that there can be
no resumption of commercial whaling while there is no humane way of killing
whales.
The resumption of commercial whaling will be resisted by nations led by
France, which is proposing the creation of a whale sanctuary in the
Antarctic. France is backed by Britain and other European countries.
The International Whaling Commission introduced a moratorium on commercial
whaling in 1986. The moratorium has not been complete, however, partly
because Japan, Norway and Iceland carry out scientific whaling, which they
say is conducted for research.
The three want whaling to be resumed under the revised management procedure
(RMP), a programme of allowing commercial whaling under supervision. If the
commission agreed the RMP could come into operation within a year.
Yesterday 3,000 people at an anti-whaling rally in Glasgow were urged by Mr
Tony Banks, Labour MP for Newham North-West, to boycott products made by the
three whaling countries.
He said Norway and Iceland should be denied membership of the EC if they did
not pledge to give up whaling, and economic sanctions should be imposed on
Japan if it insisted on scientific whaling.
