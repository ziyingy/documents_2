The German government yesterday gave the go-ahead for a publicity offensive
to promote part-time working, aimed at persuading employers to provide more
part-time jobs for an estimated 2.5m workers. Details of legal protection
for part-time workers, potential productivity gains for employers, and
pension rights, will be advertised in 30m newspapers and magazines, and
100,000 brochures. The current proportion of workers employed part-time in
Germany is only 15.5 per cent. compared with 34.3 per cent in the
Netherlands, and 23.7 per cent in Sweden. The government's campaign does not
intend to offer financial incentives to employers, but a draft law will give
part-time workers the right to claim full unemployment benefit for three
years after they switch from full-time employment.
