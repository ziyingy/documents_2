TAIWAN said early today it would need a transitional period after joining
the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade to conform with the world trade
body's rules, Reuter reports from Geneva.
It also announced it would not adhere to either Gatt's existing civil
aviation code or the Gatt government procurement code until its industries
became internationally competitive.
Ke-Sheng Sheu, head of the delegation of the separate customs territory of
Taiwan, Penghu, Kinmen and Matsu, made the statements to a special working
party studying its application to Gatt.
