The main issue behind the government's consultation document about nuclear
waste disposal is the need for balance between safety and cost.
The document makes clear that the government prefers using the technique
known as vitrification to transform the most dangerous forms of waste into a
type of glass which can be stored virtually indefinitely. Less dangerous
waste would be stored in special canisters.
The question is, where? Since consignment to the seabed or outer space have
been ruled out for legal and practical reasons, the choice is between deep
burial and special long-term stores on the surface. No large volumes are
involved. The amount of high-level waste awaiting disposal is the equivalent
of a four-bedroom semi-detached house, and the less radioactive intermediate
level waste about 10 houses.
Surface storage has the advantage of keeping the waste where it can be seen.
But it is more vulnerable to terrorists and accidents - and even the onset
of a new ice age. It is also more expensive because it needs guarding for
centuries, and the government feels that future generations should not have
to look after our mess.
Deep storage has the advantage of providing the closest thing to a permanent
solution - hence the government's preference for it. More attractive still,
it is cheaper.
There was a time when much of the environmental movement also favoured deep
storage, but yesterday the reaction from that quarter was largely hostile.
The idea of a nuclear 'dump' is repellent if not terrifying to many people.
But among the less emotional criticism of deep storage was the Friends of
the Earth appeal for a more flexible approach.
FoE said that the permanence of deep storage deprived future generations of
the option of using a better solution if one was found. It advocates surface
storage with adequate financing to fund research into better methods.
The nuclear industry welcomed the document. It has always favoured deep
storage because of its permanence and relative cheapness. But the nuclear
companies were also pleased to see that the government is keeping its
options open on other key issues.
Chief among these is the period required to allow nuclear stations to 'cool
down' when their operating lives are over. Under current policy companies
are required to remove the most dangerous materials as soon as possible and
leave the stations for 100 years before final dismantling.
Yesterday's document, however, acknowledges the nuclear industry's case that
it may be better to leave the power stations to cool down for longer because
they are then less dangerous and cheaper to take to bits. Although the
document does not propose this as policy, it leaves the option open.
In another significant statement the document says that nuclear companies
may hold spent fuel in a dry store for its 50-year cooling-off period if
they wish, rather than send it to Sellafield for vitrification. This will
delight Nuclear Electric and Scottish Nuclear, which have complained about
the cost of reprocessing, with the Scottish company saying that it could
save Pounds 45m a year by using dry store.
But the implication that it may make more commercial sense for nuclear
companies to use dry store rather than reprocessing raises questions about
the government's approval last year of the controversial Pounds 2bn Thorp
reprocessing plant.

                   PLANNING FOR THE HALF LIFE
 -----------------------------------------------------------------
CATEGORIES OF NUCLEAR WASTER
 -----------------------------------------------------------------
High level:
 -----------------------------------------------------------------
Mainly spent fuel rods from reactors.  Highly radioactive and
needs long-term treatment.  Can either be vitrified (see below)
or held in dry store for 50 years before final disposal.
 -----------------------------------------------------------------
Intermediate level:
 -----------------------------------------------------------------
Fuel rod cladding, contaminated water-filters and sludge.  This
waster is encapsulated in concrete or placed in on-site vaults
and stored for a period before final disposal.
 -----------------------------------------------------------------
Low level:
 -----------------------------------------------------------------
Clothing and other lightly contaminated equipment.  After
treatment or a short period of storage much of this can be
disposed of normally, or buried in a low level disposal site.
 -----------------------------------------------------------------
THE OPTIONS FOR DISPOSAL
 -----------------------------------------------------------------
Vitrification:                Grinding high level wasters into
                              powder and mixing it with glass-
                              making materials to form a liquid
                              which hardens inside stainless
                              steel containers.  Then left in a
                              surface store to cool for 50 years
                              before final disposal.
 -----------------------------------------------------------------
Dry store:                    A cheaper alternative to
                              vitrification.  Spent fuel rods are
                              placed intact in a special surface
                              store and allowed to cook naturally
                              for 50 years.  After that they may
                              be  vitrified or place in a deep
                              repository.
 -----------------------------------------------------------------
Deep repository:              Burial in specially constructed
                              vaults half a mile underground.
                              Nirex, the agency owned by the UK
                              nuclear industry, is seeking
                              permission to build an experimental
                              site near the Sellafield reprocessing
                              plant in Cumbria.
 -----------------------------------------------------------------
Burial at sea:                Ruled out earlier this year when the
                              UK signed an international agreement
                              banning disposal of radioactive waste
                              at sea.
 -----------------------------------------------------------------
Ejection into outer space:    An option much favoured by science
                              fiction writers, but ruled out on
                              practical grounds
