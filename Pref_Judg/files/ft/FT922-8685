GAMBRO, Sweden's leading medical equipment manufacturer, announced yesterday
a 25 per cent rise in its profits after financial items, to SKr176m (Dollars
29.8m), for the first three months of the year. Sales were up 10 per cent to
SKr1.48bn.
Mr Berthold Lindqvist, the company's president, said the favourable
performance stemmed partly from the continuing integration of the US medical
equipment company Cobe, acquired in 1990. He also attributed the improvement
to product launches in recent years, rationalisation measures, and expansion
in markets where Gambro had been active.
He added that the company expected income for the year to exceed 1991's
figure of SKr594m.
