Sir, Your leader comment 'Antarctica's frozen future', (May 3), suggested
that, contrary to the agreement of a 50-year prohibition an minerals
exploration, a shorter moratorium of 20 to 30 years only, would allow
'sufficient time for international regulations to be worked out to ensure
that mineral extraction . . . is conducted within generally accepted
environmental norms'.
The reason this is not supported by Greenpeace, or any of the Antarctic
Treaty nations which met in Madrid, is because mineral extraction would not
be possible without irreversible environmental damage to this unique region.
Accidents will always happen, as the history of oil exploration makes very
clear, and as the oil companies themselves would admit. We welcome the fact
that international co-operation between 39 countries, based on the
precautionary principle, has secured Antarctica's future for at least 50
years, and hopefully for much longer.
