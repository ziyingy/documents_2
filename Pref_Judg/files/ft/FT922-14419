Isaac Asimov, the Russian-born US writer who died yesterday at the age of
72, was probably the best-known 20th century author of science fiction,
writes Gay Firth.
Born in 1920, he received a PhD in biochemistry from Columbia University,
New York, but at 38 left teaching to write full-time. 'Sci-fi' formed only
part of his output. As prolific as he was popular, about 400 books for lay
readers cover a variety of scientific topics, such as The Human Brain (1964)
and The Collapsing Universe (1977).
Of about 100 sci-fi novels and stories - many made into films - his short
story Nightfall (1941) is possibly the best. The most interesting may prove
to be a landmark trilogy, Foundation (1951-1953), built round a version of
social determinism transplanted to a trans-galactic community.
Asimov's unshaken faith in the potential of technology to bring order to
society placed him among the most well-meaning of writers. He developed his
sci-fi subjects and his style (readable, but somewhat stolid) while
contributing to the magazine Astounding, and stuck to them for 50 years.
The I, Robot series of novels (which introduced Asimov's Three Laws of
Robotics, the first of which states that 'A robot may not injure a human
being or, through inaction, allow a human being to come to harm') brought
critical mockery, even notoriety, for their degree of mechanical dialogue
from their all-too-robotic human characters.
