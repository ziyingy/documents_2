DIRECT genetic treatment of inherited diseases such as cystic fibrosis and
haemophilia is to receive official approval today.
A Department of Health committee headed by Sir Cecil Clothier, former
chairman of the Police Complaints Authority, has decided that gene therapy
can go ahead in the UK, subject to certain ethical safeguards.
The procedure, pioneered in the US, involves correcting genetic defects by
adding new genes to the cells where they are needed. It is expected to be
more effective and longer-lasting than conventional drugs.
The treatment approved is 'somatic gene therapy'. It corrects the defect by
adding new genes to certain cells - for example in the bone marrow or lungs
 -but the genetic change is not passed on to the patient's offspring.
In contrast, 'germ line gene therapy', which would affect future
generations, is regarded as medically unpredictable and ethically
unacceptable. It will not be approved in the foreseeable future.
