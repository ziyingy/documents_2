Sir, As managing director of a commercial Internet access provider, I was
interested and concerned by Louise Kehoe's piece on Internet security
(Technology: 'Crime on the line', March 3).
It is time people heard a commercial Internet provider's view of security,
as there has been no small measure of ambulance-chasing since the advisory
on Internet security was issued on February 4 by the Computer Emergency
Response Team, the US government-sponsored group responsible for Internet
security.
The 'Trojan Horse' program described in that advisory is nothing new. It is
one of the oldest hacker tricks in the book, and has happened at many other
non-Internet sites. Existing measures and technology for implementing
security on the Internet are sufficient and economic: all that is needed is
education, and careful and thorough deployment.
The 'tens of thousands' of Internet accounts that have been broken -
academic or otherwise - would constitute just a tiny fraction of the
millions of Internet users, and the CERT action will meet their problems.
The message to emerge from all this is simple: the majority of Internet
providers are responsible and take adequate security measures. Such
providers are as responsible as phone companies in dealing with security
issues, and security practices at commercial sites are in general much more
rigorous than at academic or hobbyist sites. These commercial-quality
systems have not, to our knowledge, been affected in the recent scare.
To liken these security measures to burglar alarms is not analogous. Alarms
go off after burglary has been committed - Internet gateways are intended to
keep unwanted access out, as much as for facilitating data exchange with
other networks, and IBM and other leading corporate users of the commercial
Internet appreciate this fact.
