Seven weeks after losing Maryland's closest gubernatorial race in 75 years,
Republican Ms Ellen Sauerbrey has asked a judge to declare her the winner
because of 'widespread voter fraud'. In her lawsuit filed in the circuit
court, the former 16-year state lawmaker asked the court either to declare
her governor or order a new election. Ms Sauerbrey, who lost to the Democrat
Mr Parris Glendening by 5,993 votes, said volunteers who scoured election
records had identified more than 11,000 suspected cases of fraud or illegal
voting.
