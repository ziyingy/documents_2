Sir, The learned treatise by the pharmacist Mr Barry Riley (The Long View:
'Secrets of the drug culture', August 1) concerning the various drugs which
have been used to treat the long-term illness of Mr Brit Economy was very
interesting.
However, having been intimately acquainted with this sick gentleman for 80
years it is obvious that to avoid terminal decline, it is essential now to
administer large doses of pragmaticol and comonsenserin.
