THE HANDFUL of rich men who run Rolls-Royces on their businesses are going
to be clobbered by the new company car tax rules.
It is hard for ordinary mortals to feel too badly about the fact that they
are going to have to pay anything from Pounds 10,000 to Pounds 15,000 a year
in extra income tax. Most of them will still have an awful lot of spending
money left.
But the effect on Rolls-Royce Motors and the shrinking band of craftsmen it
employs is potentially dire. Unless, that is, changes can be made to the
Finance Bill which will give effect to the chancellor's Budget proposals
while it goes through the House of Commons.
Rolls-Royce Motors is not in the best of financial health. Last year, it
sold 1,378 Rolls-Royce and Bentley cars - 380 of them, nearly all to
companies, in Britain - compared with the 3,000-plus world-wide in the
loadsamoney days of the mid to late 1980s. And it is reckoned to have made a
loss of about Pounds 25,000 on each car sold in 1992.
Having shed nearly 1,000 workers earlier this year in a bid to be slim
enough to be profitable while making only 1,378 cars a year, the thought of
the Budget denying it even a single home market sale is unappealing. So, the
lobbying has started.
In badgering MPs to support a better tax deal for megabuck motorists,
Rolls-Royce will, at least, have the moral support of Mercedes-Benz UK. The
man who runs a Mercedes-Benz 600SEL (list price Pounds 88,600) on his
company will see the taxman's take go up from Pounds 3,720 now to Pounds
4,018 next year, and then more than double to Pounds 8,272 in tax year
1994-5.
That apart, Mercedes-Benz and all the other purveyors of full ranges of
luxury and executive cars, such as Jaguar, Daimler and BMW, have greeted the
Budget with relief. Even, in the case of Jaguar, with enthusiasm.
It calculates that the vast majority of its customers will do rather well
out of it - which, of course, means it will, too. This is all because the
formula based on both engine capacity and price is to be replaced by one
based on list price only.
Here is how the sums add up. A 40 per cent taxpayer who drives a
Mercedes-Benz 190E 2.6 (list price Pounds 25,700) between 2,000 and 18,000
business miles a year now pays Pounds 2,300 tax on the benefit. Under the
new rules, this goes up to Pounds 2,484 next year and then drops to Pounds
2,399 in 1994-95.
The user-chooser with a Mercedes-Benz 190D 2.5 will do better still. From
the present Pounds 2,300, the tax charge rises to Pounds 2,481 from the
fifth of next month and then falls by Pounds 467 to Pounds 2,017 in 1994.
One can see why Rolls-Royce - and, to a lesser extent, Mercedes-Benz UK -
are crying for a cap to be put on taxable car values at, say, Pounds 60,000.
Rolls-Royce feels the loss of revenue would be insignificant but implies
that the loss to the United Kingdom if tax sounded the marque's death knell
would be enormous.
All Jaguars, except for the Pounds 46,600 XJ12, will attract 1994-95 tax
penalties lower than those for 1993-94 by between Pounds 39 (the XJ6 3.2)
and Pounds 880 (XJS 4.0 coupe). A Jaguar XJ12 user will have to pay another
Pounds 333.
But a jubilant Roger Putnam, Jaguar's sales and marketing director, says
this is substantially less than a similar imported V12 (he means a BMW 750i
or 850i or a Mercedes-Benz 600SE or 600SL) would cost the customer.
The chancellor's decision to increase company car tax scale charges by 8 per
cent has gone down less well. It means the driver of a just under two-litre
Rover 800 will pay an additional Pounds 88 a year.
On the other hand, drivers of fuel-saving and environmentally friendly
diesel cars like the Pounds 17,995 Peugeot 605SLDT, Pounds 18,435 Citroen XM
Turbo or Pounds 18,595 Rover 825D will gain substantially.
They have been hard hit by having to pay roughly double the tax of their
petrol-powered counterparts simply because the engines of their vehicles
broke the two-litre cylinder capacity band by a few measly cubic
centimetres. Now, they will pay the same.
Full marks, they will say, to the chancellor for ending a flagrant
injustice; but only two cheers for not increasing the price differential
between unleaded petrol and diesel fuel. They find this hard to square with
his declared aim of using higher fuel prices to reduce energy consumption
and air pollution.
Modern diesel cars use up to 30 per cent less fuel and put less muck into
the atmosphere even than petrol cars with exhaust catalysers. Yet, diesel
prices at the pump, in spite of a marginally lower rate of duty, remain
obstinately about the same as those of unleaded petrol.
Barring Switzerland, where diesel is actually 1.5p a litre dearer than
unleaded petrol, every other European country encourages diesel cars with
cheaper fuel - by as much as 19p a litre in France and 18p in Holland.
The Society of Motor Manufacturers and Traders, the car-makers' mouthpiece
in Britain, thought it really had got the diesel car message across to
government this year. But it believes one expert adviser who has the
chancellor's ear does not like diesel cars and is more inclined to put in
the boot than a good word.
Perhaps next year . . .

are sold
