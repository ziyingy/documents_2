Sir, Regarding the article 'Drugs claim on Gibraltar border' (December 3-4),
while the Spanish government's apparent concern about illicit smuggling into
Spain is admirable, its own efforts to control a substantial black economy
and, in particular, illegal money laundering activities via the
Franco-Spanish frontiers is shameful.
What is remarkable is the extent to which this activity has fuelled a
mini-property boom in neighbouring Biarritz in the midst of a deep economic
recession.
