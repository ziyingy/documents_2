Anyone fancy running a small country? The job of chief executive of the
Falkland Islands government is up for grabs. It pays well - Pounds 50,000 a
year - and there are the usual perks, unlimited fishing, rough shooting,
free limo etc . . .
Ronald Sampson, the boss since April 1989, is leaving when his contract
expires. He's returning to the family home at Stratford upon Avon, so far
without any other job lined up. Faced with the messy task of untangling
20-odd companies involved in a fishing fiasco, which left the Falkland
Islands with losses of some Pounds 25m, he's acquitted himself well. 'We've
been scandal-free for five years,' he adds - no mean achievement given the
islands' history.
Potential replacements will be required to strut their stuff in front of an
interviewing board consisting of Sampson; Sukey Cameron, the islands
government's London representative; Gordon Jewkes, a former governor; a bod
from the Foreign Office; and Paul Stevenson, former Royal Marines'
commander.
The job involves managing 200 civil servants (10 per cent of the population)
and representing the islands in commercial and overseas contexts. It could
be a particularly sensitive post given the flurry of excitement over the
islands' oil potential, although exploration is unlikely to start before
1995. Sounds like just the sort of challenge for Bob Horton, the deposed
boss of British Petroleum, if he were not tied up back home trying to make
sure that Britain's railway privatisation runs on time.
