UNITED NATIONS troops in the former Yugoslavia should have an expanded human
rights mandate, Mr Tadeusz Mazowiecki, said yesterday, writes Frances
Williams in Geneva. The former Polish premier, appointed UN special human
rights investigator this month, said he would also recommend the setting up
of an international commission to investigate atrocities.
Human rights were 'totally non-existent' in Bosnia, he said after a five-day
tour which took in Zagreb and Vukovar in Croatia, Banja Luka, Bihac and
Sarajevo in Bosnia, and Belgrade, the Serbian capital. Citing world inaction
after earlier reports of gross human rights abuses, he told reporters in
Geneva that what mattered was ending the war and the atrocities. The
international community had to provide 'effective help and effective
remedies'.
His preliminary report to the UN Human Rights Commission, due to be sent to
the 53 members today, would include a recommendation to enlarge the mandate
of UN forces to report, and perhaps act to prevent, human rights abuses,
which they cannot now do.
