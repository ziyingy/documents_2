Wall Street
US SHARE prices edged lower in subdued trading yesterday as investors
struggled to find their economic bearings in the wake of last Friday's
surprisingly strong May employment report, writes Patrick Harverson in New
York.
The Dow Jones Industrial Average closed 13.01 down at 3,532.13. The Standard
&amp; Poor's 500 slipped 2.37 to 447.69, while the Nasdaq composite retreated
7.40 to 694.61. Trading volume on the New York SE totalled 237m shares.
The week opened with investors still confused about the state of the
economy. Last Friday's unexpectedly strong showing from the labour markets -
the 209,000 gain in non-farm payrolls during May was well above forecasts -
failed to lift share prices, primarily because the news forced bond yields
higher, and only added to the uncertainty surrounding the progress of the
apparently faltering economic recovery.
Thus, with doubts still surrounding the outlook for the economy, and with
bond prices little changed at midday, the equity markets drifted yesterday
for lack of a firm direction from external forces. Some traders warned that
the markets were settling in for a long summer of listless trading, with
prices probably moving within a relatively narrow range.
Advanced Micro Devices, after a delayed opening due to an order imbalance,
plunged Dollars 4 1/4 to 23 3/4 in volume of 5.2m shares on news that the
company's main rival, Intel, had won a legal ruling on Friday that will help
it in its battle to restrict AMD from selling clones of Intel's best-selling
microchip. Intel, traded on the Nasdaq market, rose Dollars 1 3/4 to Dollars
58 1/8 in volume of 11m shares.
Parker &amp; Parsley climbed Dollars 2 3/4 to Dollars 30 1/8 after announcing
plans to sell some oil and gas rights to Louis Dreyfus for Dollars 157m, and
to raise its offer for the energy partnerships owned by Prudential
Securities from Dollars 466m to Dollars 508m.
BankAmerica declined Dollars 1 to Dollars 42 in volume of 2.7m shares after
Prudential Securities lowered its rating on the bank's stock from a 'hold'
to a 'sell'. Other banking issues were also lower as investors worried that
interest rates might soon be raised by the Federal Reserve: Citicorp shed
Dollars 1 3/8 to Dollars 26 3/8 , Chase Manhattan Dollars 1 1/4 to Dollars
28 5/8 and Chemical Dollars 1 5/8 to Dollars 35 1/2 .
Cooper Tire &amp; Rubber plummeted Dollars 7 1/2 to Dollars 25 1/8 on 6.5m
shares traded after stating that second-quarter sales would probably fall
below the level achieved a year ago.
On the Nasdaq market, Repligen forged ahead Dollars 1 3/4 to Dollars 7 3/4
as the company began trials of its therapeutic vaccine for carriers of the
HIV-Aids virus.

TORONTO finished on a mixed note after reduced but fairly busy trading. The
TSE 300 index was 2.4 off at 3,892.2, although advancing issues narrowly
outnumbered declines by 363 to 354. Volume came to 57.3m shares, down from
Friday's 75.6m, and trading value fell to CDollars 564.9m from CDollars
713.7m.
Nine of the 14 sub-group indices were higher, led by pipelines, up 1.5 per
cent, and transportation, 1.2 per cent stronger. The day's biggest decline
belonged to financial services, down 1.4 per cent. The gold and energy
groups closed little changed.
