THE DROUGHT that has ravaged crops and cost hundreds of millions of dollars
in countries across Asia and the South Pacific appears to be over,
meteorologists say, reports Reuter from Sydney.
Its cause, the climatic phenomenon known as El Nino, is dissipating with
some areas returning to normal weather conditions more quickly than others,
they said.
Australia is among the first of the major agricultural producers to emerge
from drought in most areas, while in India a return to normal rainfall is
expected in the late monsoon.
China's northern provinces are still in the grip of drought, however, though
it is unlikely to have much impact on the country's international trading
position.
'We're now in the declining phase of El Nino, it's global and it has had an
effect since early last year all round the planet, particularly in the
tropical regions,' an official at Australia's National Climate Centre said.
Ocean waters in the central and eastern equatorial Pacific, which had warmed
under El Nino were continuing to cool quite rapidly, the climate centre
reported.
Australia, whose farm sector was ravaged by drought and economic recession,
has already felt the effect of the changing conditions. 'Australia tends to
climb out of it earlier than others,' the official said.
Drought conditions still persist in some areas of New South Wales and
southern Queensland but local output of grain and sugar is forecast to
recover significantly after last year's drought across eastern Australia.
The total value of wheat, coarse grains and sugar is forecast to rise by
nearly 30 per cent to ADollars 3.14bn (Pounds 1.2bn) in the year to the end
of June, 1993, compared with the previous drought-hit year.
In India however, the change is taking longer to come through. 'It is
expected to come back to average in the late monsoon season,' Australia's
climate centre official said. Erratic rains in India last year caused food
grain output to fall to about 171m tonnes in the year to June 30, 1992 from
the previous year's record 176m tonnes.
