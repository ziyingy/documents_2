ORIX, the largest leasing company in Japan, will securitise the income from
part of its business in the domestic market to diversify ways of raising
cash, Reuter reports from Tokyo.
This will be the first time for a non-bank to sell securities directly in
Japan without the help of financial institutions.
The first securities, totalling Y3bn (Dollars 24m), will be sold to
investors through an Orix subsidiary yet to be established.
The subsidiary will sell to investors the right to the income from a
particular leasing contract which Orix has signed with a client. The
investors will then receive the income from the contract.
The minimum security will be Y50m. Orix hopes to start selling the
securities within a few months.
Some Japanese leasing companies now securitise part of their assets through
trust banks and are searching for new methods of raising funds to ease
financial tightness.
