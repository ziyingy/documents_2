BRITISH Airways has banned smoking on some transatlantic flights in a
three-month trial.
The ban has applied on domestic routes for nine years and on flights to Hong
Kong following a similar experiment. From September 11 there will also be no
smoking on flights to continental Europe which last less than 90 minutes.
