ANGRY French farmers yesterday stepped up their demonstrations against
agriculture policy reform in the European Community.
Protests were recorded in at least seven areas - from Nantes, where market
gardeners dumped several tons of vegetables on the streets, to Rennes, where
shallot growers ransacked a local agriculture ministry office, and Toulouse,
where farmers continued to man road blocks for a second day. In the
Eure-et-Loire district, south-west of Paris, tractor drivers staged an
operation escargot (go-slow), causing many traffic jams.
Mr Louis Mermez, agriculture minister, yesterday met farm organisations to
study how to implement the reforms, and said the government was ready to
hold a parliamentary debate on agriculture.
France's RPR Gaullist party accused the ruling Socialists of 'deception' and
of betraying farmers' interests in the recent agreement on EC farm policy
reform.
Mr Raymond Lacombe, president of the FNSEA, the main farmers' union, tried
to cool the temperature yesterday by reminding farmers that they could only
influence the detail, but not the basic direction, of EC farm reform.
However, a vocal minority of French farmers is resolutely against against
the principle of a decline in guaranteed prices and a shift towards direct
income aid, as envisaged in the reforms. They are represented by Rural
Coordination, an extreme splinter group, which yesterday called on its
members to toughen their protests. Rural Coordination was formed late last
year, in protest against the perceived ineffectiveness of a large
demonstration by the two mainstream unions, the FNSEA and the CNJA, in
Paris.
The movement, made up of discontented FNSEA and CNJA members, wants an
increase in farm prices and the complete abandonment of the EC reforms. The
two unions believe this is unrealistic.
