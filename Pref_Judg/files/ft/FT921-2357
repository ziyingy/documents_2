The Soho-based advertising agency, Reay Keating Hamer, has just published
the results of telephone interviews last month with 100 'don't know' voters
of all ages, both sexes and from the north and south. The main finding is
that 'the current advertising offerings from the political parties are
missing the mark'.
Only 18 per cent could spontaneously recall any political advertising. Only
half of that group attributed their recall to the correct party, while the
research discovered that 'credibility comparisons showed that politicians
are on a par with estate agents and tabloid journalists'. Reay Keating Hamer
currently does not handle any political advertising.
