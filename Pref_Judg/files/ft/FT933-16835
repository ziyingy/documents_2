BRITISH GAS and a Shell-Exxon consortium are to be granted petroleum
exploration rights in Poland with talks on a final agreement expected to be
completed in August, Polish officials have said.
The concessions are to be granted under a tender opened early last year and
a new tender covering in eastern Poland is expected to be announced
following completion of the present talks. The areas under discussion are
east of Gdansk and west of Warsaw.
Last October Amoco signed a USDollars 20m oil exploration agreement for
areas south-west of Warsaw and south of Lublin in the east. This was
followed this week by an agreement to spend USDollars 10m over three years
drilling for methane in Silesia.
