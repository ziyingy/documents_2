Ana Guadalupe Martinez and other FMLN guerrilla leaders sign an agreement
with the El Salvador government in Mexico City at the weekend on
constitutional reforms - but this did not involve a ceasefire. Also in
Mexico, the first stage of peace talks between the Guatemalan government and
left-wing rebels ended with an agreement on ground rules for further
discussions.
