The Ministry of Defence yesterday invited tenders for a new ocean survey
vessel for the Royal Navy's Hydrographic Service from Swan Hunter, VSEL and
a consortium of BAe/Sema and Appledore shipbuilders.
Tenders for the vessel are due in October, for a decision by the end of the
year.
Constructions Mecaniques de Normandie, the sole prospective bidder for Swan
Hunter, the Tyneside shipbuilder in receivership, hopes Swans will win the
ship in order to provide the workload CMN requires before it is willing to
buy the yard.
Yesterday CMN, receiver Price Waterhouse and MoD officials met to try to
break the deadlock over terms for the proposed transfer of Swans' MoD
frigates contract to CMN, a key element in the company's proposal for a
conditional purchase deal. CMN described the talks as useful.
Last night the MoD confirmed that it had offered fresh proposals on the
price at which it would be prepared to transfer Swans' frigates contract to
CMN. The MoD said CMN had undertaken to give a decision today.
