MEXICO received Dollars 15.02bn in new foreign investment last year, a 54
per cent increase on 1990, according to figures calculated by the Monterrey
newspaper, El Norte, writes Damian Fraser in Mexico City.
The figures are difficult to calculate because of the need to distinguish
between new investment and appreciation on existing investment. But El Norte
estimates that Mexico's capital markets received two-thirds of the flow of
new investment in 1991 - Dollars 5.64bn on the stock exchange, Dollars
3.41bn in Mexican government paper, and Dollars 2.15bn in internationally
issued bonds. The government also granted permission for a further Dollars
3.8bn in direct foreign investment.
Thus, about 60 per cent of the new foreign investment is volatile, in that
it can be withdrawn at short notice.
