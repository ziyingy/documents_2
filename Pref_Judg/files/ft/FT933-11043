HEALTH WARNINGS will be extended from cigarettes to packs of cigars, pipe
and hand-rolling tobacco and snuff from the start of next year under
government regulations.
Baroness Cumberlege, health minister, said the move, in line with a European
Community directive, was an 'important part of our strategy to reduce
smoking levels'.
