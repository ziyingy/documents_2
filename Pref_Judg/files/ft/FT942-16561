Amersham International, the UK health science group, has forged an alliance
with Molecular Dynamics of the US and Hitachi of Japan to co-promote a new
range of automated systems for use in DNA sequencing.
Amersham has also paid Dollars 2.7m (Pounds 1.9m) for warrants to purchase a
stake of up to 10 per cent in Molecular Dynamics over the next three years
at a cost of Dollars 13.2m.
Mr Bill Castell, chief executive, said the partnership built on Amersham's
Dollars 52m acquisition of US Biochemical a year ago. 'US Biochemical is the
market leader in enzyme reagents used in manual sequencing and we wanted to
get into the fast-moving automated sequencing market.'
In the US and Europe, Molecular Dynamics will market Amersham's DNA
sequencing robot and a complementary Hitachi product with Amersham supplying
reagents and technical support. Hitachi will market the products in Japan.
Amersham will also collaborate in the development of reagents for Molecular
Dynamics' other existing and future instruments.
A six-year old company which floated in 1993, Molecular reported
disappointing quarterly figures on Wednesday. But Mr Castell said: 'We feel
it has good long-term prospects though it has a few short-term problems.'
Amersham has the option to buy Molecular shares in the market.
The worldwide market for automated sequencing systems and reagents is valued
at about Dollars 180m and is growing at about 20 per cent a year partly
because of demand generated by the Human Genome project.
