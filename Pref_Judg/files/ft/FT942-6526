Crimes against foreigners in Moscow have fallen, according to the Russian
capital's police force, largely because foreign residents and visitors are
learning to be more careful.
Viktor Seroshtan, the head of Moscow police's special service department,
said there were 464 registered cases of crimes against foreigners in the
first four months of this year, 208 of them on the city's streets, compared
with 525 incidents in the same period in 1993.
