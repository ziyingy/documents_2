Small companies welcomed Norman Lamont's Budget measures to encourage big
companies to pay their bills on time. So why, ask the approved managers in
last November's BT sale, has the government still not paid them? According
to government officials, the approved managers, mainly small stockbrokers,
submitted inaccurate bills - now they have been sorted out the brokers
should get paid next month. Not so, according to the said managers who had
been led to believe it could take a year to pay them. Whatever happens, it
does not seem likely that the government will pass the Lamont bill-paying
test.
