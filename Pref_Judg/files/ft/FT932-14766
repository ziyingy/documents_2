THE PERUVIAN fishmeal industry is gearing up for a bonanza predicted to last
for the next two to three years. By late 1992, the sardine and anchovy that
form the staple raw material for the industry were back in abundance after
being temporarily affected by the appearance of the dreaded warm current
known as 'El Nino', which last ravaged fishmeal output in 1983.
Contrary to predictions, however, Peruvian production survived last year's
milder visitation and a late boost in fish stocks turned 1992 into yet
another record year. Peru topped the world exporters' league with 1.37m
tonnes, narrowly outstripping Chile's 1.21m tonnes.
'Statistically, the years after a Nino are excellent,' says Mr Espino of
Imarpe, Peru's maritime institute, which is charged with husbanding the
resource and recommending periodic fishing bans. Mr Espino estimates that
the Peruvian catch could be raised by a quarter or a third from the present
6m tonnes a year without detriment to the species.
'And if the fishmeal producers started going for jack mackerel - at present
only about 80,000 tonnes a year are landed, perhaps 5 per cent of total
stocks - then the sky's the limit,' he says.
The main limitation on such expansion is fleet capacity. Most Peruvian
fishing boats are small, with no refrigeration and hug the coast. When El
Nino hits, the fish move into deeper waters farther out to sea where these
boats cannot follow.
Peruvian producers say they have invested more than Dollars 200m in the past
two years in fleet renovation and plant and equipment modernisation ashore.
The industry is moving towards production of higher-quality, low
temperature, steam-dried meal with 'stickwater' plants to maximise protein
recovery. New boats with refrigerated holds are under construction in local
yards. But there's still plenty of room, and a warm welcome waiting, for new
investment from abroad.
Representatives from Chile's huge Angelini group have been in Peru recently
on 'feeling-out' visits. And Venezuelan capital has already entered in the
form of a new fishmeal joint venture under the name of Palangrera Peruana.
But the big surprise of 1993 could be the arrival of the Chinese. Pesca
Peru, the state-owned fishmeal and fishoil giant that produces around 40 per
cent of all national output, is high on this year's privatisation list.
Coopers and Lybrand, with financing from the Canadian development agency and
the World Bank, is currently completing a valuation and will recommend on
sale procedures.
Essentially, the choice is between splitting the company into its 20 plants
and four refineries to sell off individually; or selling the whole company
as one unit.
The only likely buyers on the latter basis would be the Chinese - 'and it's
a possibility that has the private producers in a state of panic', says Mr
Eric Topf, head of the Pesca Peru privatisation committee.
Unofficially, senior Pesca Peru officials say the company should fetch 'at
least Dollars 200m', a ball-park figure considered over-optimistic by
private producers.
The state-owned plants are, by and large, elderly and outdated - though
several are excellently located on the now-desirable extreme southern coast
and have their own quays. Drastic personnel reductions during 1992 put Pesca
Peru back into profit after years in the red, underlining just how
profitable producing fishmeal can be, even from scrap-yard plants.
China has established itself as far and away Peru's largest customer, buying
last year almost 60 per cent of all output. Peruvian fishmeal goes to feed
the Pacific prawn, turbot and eel which China is successfully exporting in
quantity to the US and Japan.
The Chinese are said to be producing at present some 32m tonnes of animal
foodstuffs a year, in which they use 2 per cent fishmeal - a very low
percentage compared with most competitors. A high-level Peruvian delegation
is now in China 'to try to convince them of the bounties of boosting that
fishmeal component,' says Mr Salomon Manzur, Peruvian president of the
Fishmeal Exporters' Association.
If the Chinese do increase the percentage of fishmeal in their current
animal feedstuff production, Peruvian producers will be assured of sales for
their expanded fishmeal output for several years to come.
