The government yesterday rejected calls for changes to the criminal injuries
compensation scheme, in spite of Labour's warnings that thousands of victims
would be worse off because of it.
Mr Michael Howard, home secretary, acknowledged that some claimants would
get less compensation under the new scheme.
But he said at least 54 per cent would get as much or more and receive their
award more quickly.
Labour's appeal for the new compensation scheme to be withdrawn was defeated
by 296 votes to 269, a government majority of 27.
