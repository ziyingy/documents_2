THE LAW Society called on the Lord Chancellor yesterday to allow wider use
of 'no win, no pay' conditional fee arrangements as a means of improving
access to justice in cases where legal aid is not available, Robert Rice
writes.
Although the arrangements are permitted under the Courts and Legal Services
Act, the Lord Chancellor has issued a consultation paper suggesting they be
permitted only in personal injury cases.
He has also suggested that lawyers should only be allowed to increase their
normal fees by 10 per cent in such cases to compensate for the risk of
getting nothing when they lose.
The society says the maximum 10 per cent increase in normal fees is too low.
It would mean that lawyers would only undertake cases which are virtually
certain to succeed.
It also argues there are cases where conditional fees could improve access
to justice.
