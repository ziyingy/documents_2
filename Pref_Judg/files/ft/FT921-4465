Britain's first county court devoted specifically to hearing patents cases
has succeeded in reducing both the time taken to bring a case to trial and
the duration of the hearing itself.
The patents court at Wood Green, North London, has been involved in 100
cases since September 1990, of which 84 were started in the patent court and
16 transferred from the High Court.
Judgments have been given in eight cases, 21 others were settled out of
court and 10 are listed for trial. Of the cases in which judgments have been
given, the average time from the issuing of a summons to trial was 42 weeks
and the average trial length was 9 1/4 hours.
This is in stark contrast to the High Court, where cases often take more
than two years to get to trial and the actual trial can take much longer
than in the patents court, according to Simon Cohen of solicitors Taylor
Joynson Garrett.
