Euro Disney, the troubled leisure group, yesterday saw its shares fall
sharply as concern mounted about the prospects for its financial rescue
plans after an inconclusive creditors meeting in Paris.
The shares, which have been highly volatile since last autumn when the full
extent of the group's financial problems became apparent, fell by 7.5 per
cent to close FFr2.70 lower at FFr33.50.
The fall was helped by the announcement that Euro Disney fell further into
the red in the quarter to December 31 with a net loss of FFr553m (Dollars
93.09m) against FFr423m in the same period of 1992.
Euro Disney's banks had originally hoped to use the meeting as a forum to
finalise plans for their strategy in the rescue talks.
But KPMG Peat Marwick, their auditor, was unable to complete its financial
analysis in time. The banks now plan to meet later this month when KPMG has
completed its report.
