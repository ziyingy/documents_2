Ramco, the oil services company, has appointed three new directors with
extensive experience in the international petroleum industry as part of its
plan to transform itself into a more broad-based energy group. Its
involvement in an Dollars 8bn project to develop large offshore oil reserves
in the Caspian Sea necessitated the board expansion.
Peter Everett, chairman of Pict Petroleum, an independent oil exploration
company and a former senior executive with Shell, joins as a non-executive
director. So too does Herbert Denton, president of a New York-based private
investment bank and a specialist in investing in the former Soviet Union.
Michael Burchell, md of Ramco Oil and Gas, joins the main board as an
executive director.
