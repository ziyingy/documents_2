Hardy Oil &amp; Gas, the independent exploration and production company,
announced net losses of Pounds 634,000 for the half year of September 30
compared with profits of Pounds 3.83m.
Although oil and gas production rose by 6 per cent, turnover fell to Pounds
26.1m (Pounds 29.5m) and operating profits nearly halved to Pounds 3.35m
(Pounds 6.04m).
Expenses and interest charges took Pounds 3.76m (Pounds 3.91m).
Mr Douglas Baker, the chairman, said the change in the tax position from a
Pounds 1.69m credit to a Pounds 225,000 charge had resulted from the full
utilisation of past petroleum revenue tax payments and changes in
legislation.
Losses per share were 0.6p (3.8p earnings).
Looking ahead, Mr Baker said there was a continuing programme of new fields
coming on stream and that despite the problems created by weak prices, the
company had excellent assets and was well financed.
