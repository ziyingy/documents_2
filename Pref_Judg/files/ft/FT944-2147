Yorkshire Electricity is to give its shareholders a Pounds 188m special
dividend after a period in which profits soared 32 per cent.
Mr Chris Hampson, chairman of the Leeds-based electricity distributor, said:
'These outstanding results reflect the delivery of our strategy of growing
the business and cutting costs.'
The pay-out, which will have to be approved at a special meeting on January
13, will be worth 90p a share to all shareholders at the close of business
last Thursday. The effect will be offset by a 22-for-25 share consolidation.
Altogether, the package has a similar effect to the share buy-backs which
other recs have completed in recent weeks. But Yorkshire said it is fairer
because it distributes the gains evenly among all shareholders. In addition
to the special dividend, shareholders will receive a 15 per cent increase in
the interim dividend to 7.92p.
In the six months to September 30, Yorkshire's turnover rose 10 per cent to
Pounds 647m, producing pre-tax profits of Pounds 97.6m, up 32 per cent on
last year's first half.
Much of the growth came from the supply business, where profits more than
doubled to Pounds 8.6m. But the distribution business also produced sharply
increased profits - up 23 per cent to Pounds 82m - thanks to cost savings.
Yorkshire is halfway through a 1,000-job reduction programme.
For domestic customers, Yorkshire will be cutting prices by 3.5 per cent
next April, when new price regulations come into force. This will bring the
total price reduction since privatisation to 19 per cent in real terms.
The result was marred by a continuing loss of Pounds 3.4m at Homepower, the
retailing venture jointly owned with East Midlands. Yorkshire said it would
decide whether to keep, sell or close down the business by next March.
The special dividend comes at the end of a week which has seen sharp rises
in electricity profits as well as indications of the first electric utility
takeover bid - for Northern Electric.
Mr Hampson said that he saw no point in recs merging in the face of takeover
threats. Any savings from merging head offices would be offset by merger
premiums and regulatory factors. However Yorkshire would consider any
actions that enhanced shareholder value.
COMMENT
The special dividend should restore Yorkshire's favour in the City, where
the perception was growing that it had lost interest in its shareholders.
The sharp drop in the share price yesterday merely reflects the fact that
Pounds 188m of cash will flow out of the company in January, but that should
be exactly offset by the share consolidation. The result also showed that
Yorkshire's efforts to grow distribution and supply profits are paying off,
the first through cost-cutting and the second by finding new customers
outside the region. Management also made a much-needed commitment to deal
with the Homepower problem before the financial year is out. The real test
will be whether the newly consolidated shares continue to trade among the
sector's highest yielding stocks.
