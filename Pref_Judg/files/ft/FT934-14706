ASEA Brown Boveri, the Swiss-Swedish engineering group, and Rolls-Royce, the
aero-engines and industrial power group, are ending their four-year
partnership created to seek contracts for UK gas-fired power stations.
ABB is paying an undisclosed sum for Rolls-Royce's 50 per cent stake in NEI
ABB Gas Turbines, the joint venture company based in Newcastle upon Tyne.
The venture, which was established in December 1989, was an important step
for both companies, which wanted to pursue opportunities created by the
privatisation of the electricity industry and the 'dash for gas'.
Rolls-Royce said yesterday it was concentrating on its relationship with
Westinghouse of the US - a main rival to ABB in the power plant business.
The two agreed a wide-ranging global-technology transfer, marketing and
co-operation deal last year.
The work formerly carried out by the joint venture, which employs 41 people,
will be included in ABB Power Plants, a company ABB is forming to cover its
UK power plant activities. This will be headed by Mr Alan Dixon, previously
managing director of the joint venture, and will still be based in
Newcastle.
The new company will take on the joint venture's main contract to build a
500MW combined cycle station at Deeside, north Wales, for National Power,
due for completion next year.
