Wall Street
AFTER four consecutive days of record-breaking gains, US stock markets ran
into profit-taking yesterday, leaving share prices marginally lower, writes
Patrick Harverson in New York.
At the close the Dow Jones Industrial Average was down 9.50 at 3,605.98. The
more broadly based Standard &amp; Poor's 500 eased 0.93 to 455.23, while the
Nasdaq composite was off 0.10 at 730.86. Trading volume on the New York SE
amounted to 212.5m shares.
Dealers and analysts were not surprised by Monday's losses. Share prices had
ended in positive territory last Friday only because of a late burst of
buying tied to the unwinding of stock index options that expired at the
close. On the first Monday after options expiration, stocks usually fall in
early trading as the markets retrace the upward steps taken late on the
previous Friday.
Often in such cases early selling peters out quickly, but this was not the
case yesterday as investors decided that five days of gains, which had
pushed the markets' indices to four new all-time highs, had left equities
looking overbought.
Profit-taking was, therefore, the order of the day and analysts said the
declines were a natural correction, and did not indicate a shift in
underlying sentiment.
Among individual stocks, cyclicals were mostly lower. General Electric,
which rose sharply last Friday on news of planned lay-offs, retreated
Dollars  7/8 to Dollars 97 3/4 in busy trading; Caterpillar gave up Dollars
 1/8 at Dollars 80 5/8 ; International Paper slipped Dollars 3/4 to Dollars
66 3/4 ; and Minnesota Mining &amp; Manufacturing dipped Dollars  3/4 to Dollars
107.
Consumer shares, which fared well last week, succumbed to profit-taking.
Philip Morris receded Dollars  5/8 to Dollars 49 5/8 , Procter &amp; Gamble
Dollars 1 to Dollars 48 1/8 and RJR Nabisco Dollars 1/8 to Dollars 5 1/4 .
Drug and healthcare stocks, another sector that did well last week, also
suffered a reaction. United Healthcare dropped Dollars 2 5/8 to Dollars 57
1/2 , Pfizer fell Dollars 1 1/4 to Dollars 62 7/8 , Merck eased Dollars  1/4
to Dollars 32 1/2 , Johnson &amp; Johnson shed Dollars 7/8 to Dollars 40 1/8 and
Bristol-Myers Squibb gave up Dollars  7/8 to Dollars 55 1/2 .
Morgan Stanley firmed Dollars  1/8 to Dollars 78 7/8 , a 52-week high, after
the securities house announced record second-quarter earnings of Dollars
225m.
Car issues, which remain in favour with investors following strong quarterly
earnings from the big three car manufacturers and buoyant car and truck
sales, bucked the trend. Chrysler climbed Dollars  3/8 to Dollars 41 3/8 ,
Ford added Dollars  5/8 at Dollars 50 1/8 and General Motors was Dollars
5/8 higher at Dollars 45 1/4 .
On the Nasdaq market, casino stocks were in trouble, with Casino Magic
losing Dollars  7/8 to Dollars 14 5/8 and Grand Casinos weakening Dollars 1
to Dollars 21 1/2 .
Canada
TORONTO posted a modest gain after relatively light trading. The TSE 300
index ended 14.6 up at 4,091.8, although rises led declines by just 356 to
351. Volume came to 38m shares valued at CDollars 413m.
Nine of the 14 sub-group indices ended higher, with golds, consumer products
and industrial products showing solid gains.
Shell Canada, which forged ahead CDollars 1 1/2 to CDollars 39, said it is
reviewing its operations in an attempt to cut costs and to improve its
pre-tax cash income by CDollars 250m by 1995.
