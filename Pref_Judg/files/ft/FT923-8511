THE Housing Corporation, which administers public-sector grants to housing
associations, confirmed yesterday that it planned to spend at least Pounds
635m on providing new homes for rent and sale in London and the home
counties in 1993-94.
The plans are based on the Conservative manifesto commitment of Pounds 2bn
funding for housing associations during that period. The funds have yet to
be confirmed.
