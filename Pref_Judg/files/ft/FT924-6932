THE British government yesterday defended its decision to delay a final
Westminster vote on the Maastricht treaty in front of angry members of the
European Parliament.
The decision to postpone the vote until May - after Denmark's second
referendum on the treaty - was criticised by some MEPs during a debate on
the Danish problem in Strasbourg.
But Mr Tristan Garel-Jones, UK Foreign Office minister, said the MEPs were
ignoring the political risks run by Mr John Major, the British prime
minister.
Stressing that he was speaking as a British minister, and not as
representative of the EC presidency, Mr Garel-Jones said: 'My government,
and my prime minister, staked a very great deal indeed on the recent vote in
our parliament.'
Mr Major is understood to have promised the postponement to recalcitrant
backbenchers as the price for their support. Privately, UK officials believe
that without that promise, the treaty might have been blocked and the outcry
from Britain's European partners would have been even greater.
'If you want leadership from John Major, you should calculate the risks that
he took for the Maastricht treaty a week or two ago,' Mr Garel-Jones told
MEPs.
Referring to opposition MPs who voted against the treaty, Mr Garel-Jones
said the Labour party had been 'playing Russian roulette' with it. 'The
British government is not prepared to do that and we will proceed with
caution and with certainty,' he said.
Separately, he dismissed as 'dangerous talk' suggestions that Denmark might
have to leave the EC. 'Small nations must be comfortable in the Community,'
he said.
