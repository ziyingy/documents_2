AT LEAST 11 people died and more than 60 were hurt in floods and mudslides
which swept through parts of the Chilean capital, police said yesterday,
Reuter reports from Santiago.
Heavy rain in the Andes mountains swelled rivers and burst canal banks on
Monday, burying parts of poorer southern neighbourhoods of Santiago under
mud and water.
Radio reports said the death toll could be 14 or higher after more bodies
were found in the mud yesterday morning.
Police and civil defence workers with earth-moving machinery struggled to
clear away mud and debris. More than 1,700 people were temporarily given
shelter in schools.
Local authorities appealed for warm clothes and food for the homeless.
A pass between Chile and Argentina was also closed after the rain caused
rock falls, and one of the world's largest copper mines, El Teniente, was
shut down for a second day after a bridge collapsed and power stations were
flooded.
