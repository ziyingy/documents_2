THE government is considering taking steps against the suppliers of the
Army's SA80 rifle, recently condemned by MPs on the cross-party defence
committee as 'verging on the shoddy', Viscount Cranborne, a junior defence
minister, said yesterday, Alison Smith writes.
'The question of liability is still under discussion,' he said, adding that
action against the company was a possibility.
The rifle, of which some 332,000 have been supplied or ordered, is made by
Royal Ordnance, which was sold to British Aerospace in 1987.
The defence committee's report listed 32 problems with the SA80, which came
into service in 1985.
