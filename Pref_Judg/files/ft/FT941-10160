Enterprise Oil Norge, the Norwegian unit of London-based Enterprise Oil,
yesterday announced that it would fund a NKr400m (Pounds 36m), three-year
Norwegian North Sea exploration programme in exchange for the right to farm
into three licences operated by Esso Norge.
The deal boosts Enterprise's net acreage on the Norwegian Continental Shelf
by 25 per cent, or 298 sq km, and gives the company a 50 per cent stake in
each of the three blocks within the Esso licenses.
Domestic analysts said they believed the deal to be the biggest of its kind
ever concluded in Norway. Enterprise said that portions of blocks 16/1, 25/8
and 25/20 in the Utsira High area with proven hydrocarbons were specifically
excluded from the farm-in.
The company explained that it had agreed the farm-in with Esso to make
greater and faster progress in building its Norwegian North Sea portfolio
than what otherwise could be accomplished under Norway's licensing regime.
Enterprise intends to drill three exploration wells - one this year in block
25/8 near Esso's producing Balder field - and to undertake three dimensional
seismic surveys over the bulk of the farm-in acreage.
Including the farm-in well, the company plans to drill up to 10 exploration
wells this year elsewhere on Norwegian shelf acreage, or one-third of all
wells to be drilled in the sector, representing its heaviest ever
exploration programme since entering Norway in 1989, when it acquired
acreage from Texas Eastern.
The two companies have already secured approval of the agreement by Norway's
industry and energy ministry and finance ministry.
