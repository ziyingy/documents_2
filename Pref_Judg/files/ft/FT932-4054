A CONFRONTATION is looming between the west and Asia on human rights.
Next week a United Nations world conference on human rights - only the
second of its kind since the second world war - opens in Vienna.
Several Asian governments say they intend using the conference to expose
what they consider to be western hypocrisy and selectivity on human rights
questions. In particular they seem intent on confronting a new US
administration which they feel is intent on increasingly linking human
rights and trade and aid issues.
Malaysia and Singapore have been making the running in articulating the
so-called Asian approach to human rights questions. This encompasses two
main elements:
Cultural relativism. While accepting certain basic human rights, such as the
right against arbitrary killing and torture, human rights should also
reflect local cultural and historical factors.
Singapore officials accuse the west of arrogantly imposing its concepts of
human rights on the rest of the world. They say the west's smugness must be
punctured and contradictions of its position exposed. Asia must have a
different approach: it should carefully sift through western inspired ideas
on human rights to find elements acceptable in the local context.
Malaysia says it will not accept finger wagging by the west. 'Each country
is entitled to its own perception of human rights and forcing developing
countries to follow the western perception is unfair and unjust,' says Mr
Musa Hitam, a leader of the Malaysian delegation to the conference.
Economic development. This emphasises that human rights cannot be divorced
from economic development. At a conference in Bangkok earlier this year
Asian countries signed a declaration saying economic development was 'a
universal and inalienable right and an integral part of fundamental human
rights'.
'Malaysia views development as very basic to human rights,' says Mr Musa.
'Civil and political rights should come almost automatically after
development has been achieved.'
Both these ideas are likely to come under fire in Vienna. Human rights
groups dispute that there is a consensus among Asian countries on the issue:
for instance, they say, Japan differed radically with China on human rights
at the Bangkok conference.
Ms Sidney Jones, of the human rights body Asia Watch, says human rights must
be seen as an international issue. 'If governments and their security forces
are primarily responsible for human rights abuses, it is illusory to think
that the same governments are best equipped to protect human rights ..the
only possible way ..is to acknowledge from the outset that responsibility
for protection transcends national boundaries.'
Amnesty International accuses governments in Asia of condemning the Vienna
conference to failure. Mr Pierre Sane, Amnesty's secretary general, says
many governments in Asia consider international protection and monitoring of
human rights as interference and an attempt by the west to cut their
competitiveness.
'What is at stake here is the rights of the workers in Asia,' says Mr Sane.
'If they are respected, products coming from Asia will be more expensive.
And therefore the economic competitiveness of countries like China,
Indonesia, Malaysia - the new and emerging tigers - will be threatened.
'It is a very linear concept of development whereby you fill the bellies
first, and then you provide people with freedom,' says Mr Sane. 'Maybe 100
years ago the universal consciousness could accept that to industrialise you
crush a whole generation. But it is not acceptable in 1993.'
