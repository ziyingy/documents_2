EXXON said yesterday its affiliate, Esso Exploration and Production Nigeria,
had signed a production-sharing and exploratory rights agreement with
Nigerian National Petroleum, Reuter reports from Irving, Texas.
The US oil giant said it has the right to explore and operate Block 209, a
500,000-acre tract 47 miles off the Nigerian coast. It planned to open an
office in Nigeria.
On Tuesday Nigeria signed an oil exploration and production-sharing contract
with the alliance between BP and Statoil of Norway.
It was the third agreement in a month with a foreign oil group to take all
the risks in developing new fields since shortage of cash forced the
government to stop taking majority stakes in exploration joint ventures.
