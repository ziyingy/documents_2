CUSTOMS and Excise seized a record Pounds 546m worth of illegal drugs last
year including more than two tonnes of cocaine, according to figures
released yesterday, Andrew Jack writes.
There were 2,568 arrests and 47 drug smuggling gangs broken up during the
year, the annual drug seizures statistics show. Cocaine hauls totalling
Pounds 329m - more than twice the amount of the previous year - were
confiscated. There were seizures of heroin with a street value of Pounds 48m
and cannabis worth Pounds 134m.
The seizure values rose from a total of Pounds 271m in 1991, but included
declines of a quarter in the value of synthetic drugs confiscated to Pounds
35m, and of nearly two thirds for opium to Pounds 37,000.
The figures were released two weeks after Customs announced its latest
anti-drug co-operation agreement with the Cruising Association, signed at
the London International Boat Show.
