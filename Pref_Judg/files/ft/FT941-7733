Shares in Euro Disney, the troubled leisure group, fell yesterday, losing
FFr2.05 to close at FFr34.75, as investors anticipated that debt
restructuring talks would involve a significant capital increase.
Negotiations between Euro Disney, its creditor banks, and Walt Disney, the
US entertainment group which holds 49 per cent of the European leisure
company, are expected to start within the next week.
A report on Euro Disney's financial situation and commercial strategy,
prepared by KPMG Peat Marwick, the accountancy group, has been sent to
creditor banks, clearing the way for restructuring talks.
According to the report, Euro Disney requires a capital increase of between
FFr12bn and FFr13bn (Dollars 2.2bn) to ease the burden of its FFr20.3bn
debt. 'The need for a big capital increase has been obvious for a while and
was spelt out in the preliminary audit report,' said one industry analyst.
'But the clearing of the way for serious negotiations has probably focused
attention on the implications concerning the dilution of earnings.'
Although details of the audit have not been disclosed, it is thought to
endorse many of the principal elements of a new strategy drawn up by Mr
Philippe Bourguignon, Euro Disney chairman.
This strategy includes a series of measures aimed at cutting costs and
increasing sales. Seasonal pricing schemes have been introduced for
admission to the theme park and for its hotels. At low season, for example,
hotel prices for four people range from between FFr400 and FFr1,600 per
night. Restaurants now provide less expensive meals, and there is an
emphasis on cheaper products, below FFr150, in the theme park's shops.
Euro Disney says it has also targeted its marketing efforts on areas with
greatest potential, such as London, Munich and the border areas between
France and Germany.
