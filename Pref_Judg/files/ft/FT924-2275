EMPLOYERS will have a legal obligation to provide tobacco-free rest areas
for non-smoking staff to comply with new regulations passed to carry out a
European health and safety directive.
The Workplace (Health, Safety and Welfare) regulations complete a series of
six new sets of regulations that come into force from January 1 and stem
from European directives.
This sixth and final set of regulations covers a range of areas including
ventilation and temperature, changing facilities and the condition of
floors.
The six sets of regulations are the most comprehensive reform of health and
safety at work in the UK for nearly two decades, covering areas ranging from
washroom facilities to visual display units and the lifting of heavy loads.
New workplaces opening for the first time on or after January 1, or those
which are modified, extended or converted, should comply with the new
smoking regulations straight away. Existing workplaces will have until
January 1 1996 to comply.
This set of regulations places obligations on the owners of buildings
occupied by more than one tenant to ensure that, for example, the common
parts of buildings, estate roads and other facilities meet the requirements.
