LABOUR yesterday launched a consultative document on small businesses. It is
intended to lead to the party's most comprehensive document yet on the
sector.
Mr John Smith, Labour leader, said small businesses were critically
important to job creation, exporting, innovation and the development of an
individual's sense of freedom.
