Mr Richard Leakey, the renowned conservationist, has resigned his post with
the Kenya Wildlife Service after a virulent two-week campaign against him.
Ministers and politicians have accused Mr Leakey, whose crusade led to a
much acclaimed worldwide ban on the ivory trade in 1989, of racism,
arrogance and irregular management decisions.
If Mr Leakey's resignation is accepted by President Daniel arap Moi, it will
raise severe concerns among international donors who have pledged up to
Dollars 300m for conservation to Kenya. They see Mr Leakey as personally
responsible for successes over the past five years in stamping out poaching
and improving efficiency and profitability of wildlife - the base of Kenya's
tourism industry.
The government has set up an inquiry into Mr Leakey and the KWS but refused
to make public the terms of reference.
In the past, Mr Moi has often quietly backed smear campaigns against
ministers and officials before sacking them.
At the heart of the row is the issue of land allocation in wildlife areas.
Mr Leakey warned that his resignation would have 'far reaching consequences'
and said he had resisted attempts at what he called 'land grabbing' by
politicians. He gave four specific examples, including an attempt by
'certain political figures' to have 10,000 acres carved out of the Tsavo
National Park.
'Has my insistence that the wildlife-protected areas be protected from some
greedy people been the reason for this charge (of arrogance)? I suspect so,'
Mr Leakey said yesterday.
Close associates and friends of Mr Leakey admit that he is abrasive and can
be arrogant. He has built up an independent and powerful fiefdom at KWS and
bruised many political egos and created jealousies.
