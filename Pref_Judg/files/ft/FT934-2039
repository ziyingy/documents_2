French scientists have won the international race to produce the first
comprehensive 'map' of the genes in every human cell. It will guide
researchers towards the genetic causes of thousands of diseases, ranging
from diabetes and asthma to rare forms of cancer.
The 'physical map of the human genome', unveiled by the Centre d'Etude du
Polymorphisme Humain (Ceph) in Paris yesterday, is a landmark in genetics
research. Scientists can now move more quickly to identify all of the
100,000 genes that provide a blueprint for human development.
Dr James Watson, who was in the team that discovered the double-helix
structure of DNA, in which the genetic code is stored, and is still a
leading US genetics researcher, acclaimed the achievement. 'By identifying
these genes, we can begin to develop drugs to cure rather than treat
disease,' he said.
Dr Daniel Cohen, director of Ceph, acknowledged yesterday that the map still
had gaps and inaccuracies, and its resolution needed to be improved. 'Like
any first map, it requires further study and refinement, but it can be used
immediately for genetic research,' he said.
He says 'a final, complete map of the genome will take two to five years
more of international collaborative work.'
Researchers looking for the cause of an inherited disease search first for
'genetic markers' present in patients but not in other people's DNA. Now,
they should be able to find these markers like landmarks on the new map -
and home in quickly on the gene responsible. They can then decode the gene
and, depending on its function, develop a drug to block or enhance it.
The Ceph map is described briefly in today's issue of the journal Nature.
The full data will be available on the global Internet computer network -
without patent protection. If printed out, it would form a pile of paper 300
metres high.
