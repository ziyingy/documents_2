The Swiss authorities yesterday extradited to Italy Mr Ruggero Firrao, a
former head of Sace, the Italian export credit guarantee organisation, to
face corruption charges.
Mr Firrao is the sixth person in a year to have been arrested in connection
with alleged large-scale abuses of Sace credit guarantees.
He was arrested last September by Swiss police after the issue of an
international arrest warrant.
According to Rome magistrates, Mr Firrao is alleged to have received at
least L1.4bn (Pounds 567,260) from three Italian companies in exchange for
Sace paying indemnities to them for work carried out in Libya, Tunisia and
Turkey.
Some of these monies were allegedly shared with two other members of Sace.
Mr Firrao, aged 70, and a one-time member of the executive committee of the
Bank of Italy, left Sace in 1985 and became a consultant also working for
the organisation.
In a separate development, Rome magistrates have begun investigations into
the role played by Mr Gianpiero Cantoni, the former chairman of BNL, in
granting credits to Mandelli, a Piacenza-based robotics group recently
placed in liquidation.
Mr Cantoni stepped down as chairman on Monday after a special board meeting;
and on Tuesday the Bank of Italy passed papers on BNL's relationship with
Mandelli to the magistrates.
BNL is Mandelli's biggest creditor with outstanding loans of over L100bn.
The magistrates are understood to be investigating a loan of L75bn to
Mandelli in December 1991 via BNL's offices in London.
The explanations for the purpose of this loan apparently did not satisfy
Bank of Italy inspectors and the magistrates are now trying to ascertain
whether the funds were used to buy out a stake held in an engineering
company, which was ultimately owned by Mr Cantoni's family interests.
