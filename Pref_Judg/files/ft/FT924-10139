Since the British are, as they never tire of confiding smugly to foreigners,
rather good at laughing at themselves, a series about the ghastliness of the
recession seemed a good idea. But it turns out, judging from the opening
episode, that Get Back (8.30 BBC1) is another sitcom devoted largely to
jokes about class and the horrors of living with your dreadful old dad,
subjects which you might have thought had been done to death in countless
previous series.
BBC2 launches a series billed by Radio Times as 'Vintner's Tales' which is
presumably called Vintners' Tales since it comprises six programmes about
different characters in the British wine trade. Presented by the likeably
enthusiastic Jancis Robinson, it begins (8.50) with Stephen Browett and
Lindsay Hamilton, who sell Pounds 7m worth of fine wine a year.
Channel 4's current affairs series Cutting Edge investigates Glasgow's loan
sharks and follows the Trading Standards Officers who try to keep tabs on
them (9.00).
A Fate Worse Than Death? (11.15 BBC1) gives a national screening to a
regional programme about the ethics of sustaining patients in 'a persistent
vegetative state'.
