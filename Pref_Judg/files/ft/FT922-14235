POWER cuts of at least eight hours a day have been imposed all over Colombia
in an effort to cope with a drought that has reduced the water for hydro
electric plants. There is little prospect of rain, and reservoirs are drying
into baked mud. If this continues the country could face a complete
black-out by the end of April.
The winter rains are late and the El Nino current off the Pacific coast
appears to be upsetting normal weather patterns. But bad planning, heavy
debts, corruption, budget deficits, deforestation and poor management are
behind the electricity problems.
Colombia's generating capacity is 8,200MW, more than adequate for normal
demand levels. Despite the country's ample coal and oil reserves, 78 per
cent of power comes from large, expensive hydro-electric schemes which have
pushed the sector's foreign debt up to more than Dollars 5bn.
To try to save on costs, electricity companies have been running down the
reservoirs rather than use thermal plants at full capacity. Labour and
financial problems have also delayed the maintenance of thermal power
stations, while guerrilla attacks have put distribution lines out of action.
The rationing aims to cut overall consumption by about a third. The
government has asked industry to shut down for 10 days over Easter and to
send workers on holiday.
