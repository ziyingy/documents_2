The planned US space station survived a critical vote in the House of
Representatives by a wide margin late on Wednesday, but the Dollars 30bn
(Pounds 19.7bn) project may have to trimmed back when it comes before the
Senate, writes Jeremy Kahn.
After intensive lobbying by the administration, the full House voted 278-155
to defeat an amendment to kill the programme. Many feared killing the
station would be a death blow for the National Aeronautics and Space
Administration, which has been hard hit by congressional budget hawks in
recent years. Opponents say the station is 'too much money for too little
science'.
