The Bosnian Serb parliament yesterday endorsed an agreement their leader, Mr
Radovan Karadzic, signed with Mr Jimmy Carter, former US president, earlier
this month, backing a Big Power peace plan as a basis for further
negotiations. 'The parliament informs the Contact Group and the
international community of the readiness on the part of (Bosnian Serb)
Republika Srpska to enter peace negotiations on the basis of agreement with
Carter,' said a statement issued after a parliament session.
