BRITAIN's economic recovery pre-dates its exit from the European exchange
rate mechanism - and sterling's devaluation is not the only reason for
growth returning, Mr John Major said yesterday.
'Anyone who argues that leaving the ERM was the sole cause of recovery
should inform themselves by looking at the facts,' the prime minister told
the Newspaper Society in London.
As well as underlining the government's increasing conviction that recovery
is underway, his remarks revealed a determination to take on Euro-sceptics'
opposition to a fixed exchange rate regime.
'Interest rates had been cut from 15 to 10 per cent before last September.
Gross domestic product had stabilised before September and started growing
again in the second half of last year.
'It's now clear that retail sales, industrial production and manufacturing
investment all started to recover from around the middle of last year,' Mr
Major said.
Recovery was still 'in its infancy but it's growing daily,' Mr Major said.
He warned that the continuing recession in other European countries would
affect Britain's growth performance.
The prime minister said much of the progress that the government has made
over the last year had been obscured by debate over the economy and
Maastricht.
'We have already fulfilled rather more than a third of the commitments we
made in the (1992 election) manifesto. In fact, more manifesto pledges have
been honoured in the parliamentary year since the 1992 election than was
achieved after the elections of 1979, 1983 and 1987.'
Mr Major used a separate speech on housing to warn against a return to rapid
house-price inflation. 'We do not want a return to the conditions of the
late 1980s market,' he said. 'Increased numbers of sales, and more stable
prices, are the best route forward for the housing market.
