OK Petroleum, the Swedish oil group acquired earlier this year by Saudi
Arabia's Sheikh Mohammed Al-Amoudi, yesterday moved to strengthen its
position in Sweden's retail petrol market by taking full control of the
country's 400 Texaco stations.
OK paid Dollars 60m to acquire the 50 per cent of Texaco's Swedish operation
that it did not already own.
The Texaco chain, with a Swedish market share of just over 7 per cent, is
the first large-scale direct ownership of retail operations by OK. It is
closely associated with the OK chain, but most OK stations are independently
owned.
Together, the Texaco chain - which will continue to operate under the Texaco
name - and the OK stations will have a 25 per cent market share, equalling
the share held by Norway's Statoil which last year became the country's
largest when it acquired the local BP chain.
Mr Sven-Erik Zachrisson, OK's chief executive, said the company intended to
become 'more aggressive' in the retail market in the Nordic region.
The group, with sales of SKr19.5bn (Dollars 2.5bn) last year, has two
refineries in Sweden with combined refining capacity of 265,000 barrels a
day.
It accounts for 23 per cent of the Nordic area's refining capacity.
Skeikh Mohammed Al-Amoudi paid Dollars 1.2bn for OK in March this year,
buying out the previous joint owners: Sweden's KF co-operative group, Neste,
the Finnish oil company, and the Swedish state.
The purchase, one of the biggest foreign takeovers of a Swedish-based
company, was carried out through Corral Petroleum Holdings, a private
company.
