Even by the crisis-prone standards of Europe's exchange rate mechanism, it
has been a week of extraordinary turbulence. As politicians argue about who
is to blame, monetary gun-smoke has been swirling through ministries and
financial markets across the continent.
Ireland started the acrimony with complaints against the UK and Germany over
the punt's devaluation. As the pound slumped in mid-week to record lows,
France intensified an anti-British assault - taking aim at the UK's
aggressive interest rate cuts and alleged job poaching through 'social
dumping'.
Hostilities subsided on Thursday with the Bundesbank's unexpected interest
rate cuts, intended above all to support the franc ahead of next month's
French elections. The vote is expected to bring in a right-wing government
which might be tempted to sever the franc's D-Mark link as a way of
cheapening French credit and regenerating growth. This would torpedo the
already-faltering plan in the Maastricht treaty for economic and monetary
union (Emu) by the end of the 1990s.
After Mr Helmut Schlesinger, the Bundesbank president, said he hoped
domino-like speculation against weaker currencies would cease, calm returned
yesterday to the foreign exchanges.
But, following four realignments since September, in which countries
accounting for 45 per cent of EC gross national product have devalued or
left the ERM, currency unrest is unlikely to have been completely quelled.
The ERM, set up in 1979 as the nucleus of the European Monetary System of
stable exchange rates, has become a hotbed of instability. The scale of
speculative flows across a continent now freed of exchange controls is
bigger than ever before. The inflation-adjusted value of the 'hot money'
streaming into the D-Mark in September was triple the size of the inflows
into Germany generated in 1973 by the break-up of the fixed exchange rate
Bretton Woods system. Combined with overall European economic strains caused
by the shock of German reunification, the ERM upsets have put the EC on a
knife-edge.
Advocates of EC integration fear a breakdown in European economic
co-operation, similar to the experience after the 1973 oil price rise. 'We
are in a crisis,' Mr Jacques Delors, the EC Commission president, said on
Thursday.
He welcomed the Bundesbank rate cut as a 'good political signal'. But Mr
Delors pointed to the risk that the European recession, aggravated by
Germany's fiscal imbalances and high interest rates, could scupper monetary
union. 'If there is no growth between now and 1997, there will be no Emu,'
he said.
Mr Henning Christophersen, EC economics commissioner, sounded an implicit
warning that 'competitive devaluations' could wreck the EC's barrier-free
single market which started on January 1.
At least the Bundesbank has now signalled it cares about the ERM's fate. Emu
supporters in Brussels are looking for further cuts of at least 1 percentage
point in the German discount rate - now at 8 per cent - during the next few
months.
Assuming - as seems likely - the system survives the French elections, EC
governments and central banks during the next few weeks must make crucial
decisions on its future.
There are two main alternatives. The ERM could either revert to its original
design of providing no more than a semi-fixed exchange rate framework which
would be sporadically adjusted in line with EC economic divergences. Or the
Maastricht transition to Emu could be accelerated by the Bonn and Paris
governments - creating a 'mini-Emu' around a Franco-German core, including
the Benelux countries but leaving out Britain and Italy.
The first idea - a return to a more flexible ERM - is favoured by the
Bundesbank. Germany's central bank has long been suspicious of the
Maastricht Emu plan since it would spell the demise of the D-Mark.
Additionally, the Bundesbank argues that the lack of ERM currency
realignments between 1987 and 1992 was the main cause of last autumn's
upsets.
Indeed, Germany's reunification problems may make a less ambitious ERM
inevitable. Because recession has increased budget deficits, most countries,
including Germany, are overshooting the Maastricht fiscal targets set as
conditions for Emu.
After sterling was forced to quit the ERM in September, Mr John Major, the
UK prime minister, announced Britain would not rejoin unless the system's
'fault-lines' were reformed. But the Bundesbank's support for a return to
the former ERM arrangements is backed by Denmark, whose krone this week has
come under heavy speculative attack.
Mr Erik Hoffmeyer, governor of the Danish National Bank, which was forced to
increase its discount rate by 2 points on Thursday, says: 'We are not
advocating reform of the EMS.'
Countries running policies which were not in line with stable exchange rates
would have to 'stick to the rules' of either adjusting these policies or
devaluing, Mr Hoffmeyer says. 'You cannot wait and wait and wait (for a
realignment). Otherwise, the system explodes.'
The second ERM alternative, discussed increasingly in Brussels, is more
ambitious. Under this plan, the Bonn and Paris governments could speed up
the Maastricht timetable to transform the ERM into Emu - establishing a
'mini' monetary union.
Officials in Brussels doubt whether the present ERM, including the French
franc, can survive intact until 1997 or 1999 when, under the Maastricht
plan, the EC is supposed to make an irrevocable move towards a single
currency.
There is a growing belief that the so-called 'second stage' of Emu, planned
to start next year, is simply too long - an invitation to the foreign
exchange markets to attack vulnerable currencies before Emu takes place.
Chancellor Helmut Kohl recently hinted at the possibility of a mini-Emu
outside the Maastricht treaty. The idea is fraught with political risk, and
has attracted opposition from the Bundesbank.
Nonetheless, there seems to be greater support from French and German
politicians. One senior French official in Brussels yesterday predicted
that, if the EMS broke down completely, Bonn and Paris would still rescue
monetary union. 'If the EMS collapsed, I'm sure France and Germany would
take an initiative to ensure monetary union. They would be obliged to do
it.'
Mr Helmut Schmidt, the former West German chancellor, who with French
President Valery Giscard d'Estaing was the chief EMS architect in 1978-79,
says he favours a Franco-German 'fast track'.
'I could imagine Europe going forward with a central bank system and a
single currency linking France, the Benelux countries and Germany. This
might in time become very attractive for other countries to join - not, in
the first place, Britain, but maybe Austria, Switzerland and the
Scandinavian countries.'
Mr Schmidt, who believes last autumn's currency upheavals could have been
avoided if governments had made 'timely adjustments', says the 'fast track'
plan, although desirable, is unlikely.
'I don't give it (the plan) much of a chance. The Bundesbank is against it,
as always. They are fighting for the stability of the currency. But they are
also fighting to retain their own turf.'
Mr Karl Otto Pohl, former president of the Bundesbank, who resigned in 1991
because of disagreement over the government's reunification policies, also
supports a 'multi-speed' path to Emu. 'A large monetary union (grouping all
EC countries) will never come,' says Mr Pohl, now a partner in the
Cologne-based Oppenheim bank.
Mr Pohl, like Mr Schmidt, says he is 'under no illusions' over the
difficulties of realising a smaller monetary union with a central bank
established by Germany, France and the Benelux countries. Late last month,
Mr Schlesinger ruled out accelerated monetary union on the grounds that the
Maastricht treaty stipulates that Emu cannot start before 1997.
Mr Pohl says this illustrates the Bundesbank's adroit tactics. Although the
central bank opposes the treaty's Emu timetable, Maastricht has also become
the 'main hurdle' faced by advocates of accelerated Emu, Mr Pohl points out.
Whatever the difficulties in realising 'fast track' Emu, Britain's economic
policies since September may have increased the willingness of France, in
particular, to countenance European integration without the UK.
For its part, Britain recognises that Franco-German Emu would harm its
interests.
Lord Jenkins, EC commission president between 1977 and 1981, says that, from
the viewpoint of continental Europe, 'there is a lot to be said for the fast
speed idea'. He adds: 'It would cause enormous problems for Britain . . .
Sterling would be an offshore currency caught between the dollar and the
European bloc. We would be more bullyable.'
The main factor heightening antipathy towards Britain in Brussels and Paris
is suspicion that the UK is practising benign currency neglect in a dash for
growth - ignoring the cost for others in the EC. 'Britain,' says one EC
official, 'is drifting off into the Atlantic.'
Antagonism has been fuelled by the decision by Hoover, the US appliance
maker, to close its Dijon plant and shift production to Scotland.
All this has revived complaints in Brussels about Britain's failure to sign
the Maastricht social chapter - as well as about the UK delay in ratifying
the treaty.
If British MPs performed the unexpected and voted down Maastricht
ratification this spring, this would greatly increase the likelihood of a
drive to Emu by Paris and Bonn. As the battle for Europe's money rumbles on,
the risk that a Maastricht No would strengthen still further Franco-German
monetary entente must be the factor most likely to guarantee the treaty's
passage in the House of Commons.
