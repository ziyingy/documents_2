A &amp; P Appledore's shipyard at Falmouth, Cornwall, has won the contract to
refit Nato's research vessel Alliance, which is used to detect and track
submarines.
The Italian-based vessel is to get new acoustic and oceanographic equipment
including an advanced undersea mapping system. It is the only craft jointly
owned by all 16 Nato members.
