TESCO and Texas Homecare were yesterday granted permission to seek judicial
review of the way two local authorities were seeking to enforce the law
against Sunday trading in England.
The companies protested that they had been targeted while smaller shops also
opening on Sundays were escaping legal action.
Mr Andrew Collins, for Tesco, the retail chain, which is challenging the
'discriminatory and invalid' policy of Kirklees Borough Council, asked: 'Why
should they pick on us and not others?'
He said the council had made clear that it would not pursue smaller traders,
but seek High Court injunctions to restrain larger stores from opening on
Sundays.
Mr Charles Bear, for Texas Homecare, the DIY group, which is challenging a
similar alleged policy by Newcastle upon Tyne city council, said: 'We have
been specifically targeted with another store. That's why we have taken this
pre-emptive action.' He told Lord Justice Watkins and Mr Justice Rougier it
was the duty of every local authority to be 'evenhanded' in enforcing Sunday
trading laws.
The judges agreed that both Tesco and Texas Homecare had an 'arguable case'.
