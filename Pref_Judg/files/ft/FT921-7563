THE Brazilian rancher and his son convicted for the murder of Mr Chico
Mendes, the ecological campaigner, will today appeal for their sentences to
be overturned, writes Christina Lamb in Rio de Janeiro.
Mr Darli Alves da Silva and his son Darcy were sentenced in December 1990 to
19 years' imprisonment for plotting the shotgun killing of Mr Mendes in his
home in the Amazonian town of Xapuri two years earlier.
As leader of the Amazonian rubbertappers, Mr Mendes was credited with
bringing the destruction of the rainforest by landowners to the world's
attention. His fight to save the Amazon from destruction by large landowners
ultimately cost him his life and gave the international green movement its
first hero.
Mr Darcy da Silva, 23, admitted the crime but later withdrew his confession
and subsequently maintained his innocence along with his father. However, a
15-year-old boy who had worked at their ranch gave detailed testimony of
their plotting and they were convicted unanimously.
The da Silvas hope that with the fading of international attention, their
sentences may be reversed.
However, environmental campaigners believe this would cause an international
outcry which President Fernando Collor is anxious to avoid as host of the
UN-sponsored World Environment Conference in Rio de Janeiro in June.
Mr Marcio Tomas Bastos, the prosecution lawyer, said he was confident that
the appeal would not succeed, calling the defence arguments 'poor and
inconsistent'.
