US trade officials said yesterday they had begun consulting with trading
partners on the vexed question of workers' rights and trade, and hoped to
raise the issue formally within the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade
before the summer break.
Developing countries have vigorously rejected tying worker rights to trade
privileges, which they regard as a cover for protectionism.
The US, backed by the European Union and other industrialised nations, says
its object is not to remove the comparative advantage of low labour-cost
countries, but to curb human rights abuses such as bans on trade union
membership, forced labour and child exploitation.
Though not on the formal agenda, the idea of a 'social clause' in Gatt is
expected to feature strongly in discussions at the annual conference of the
International Labour Organisation, which begins next week in Geneva.
Mr Michel Hansenne, director-general of the UN agency, has said he
personally favours a 'social clause' related to the ILO's core conventions:
the right to form trade unions and bargain collectively, and the ban on
forced labour. These, he argues, are basic human rights and can be applied
by countries at any level of development.
He proposes making a ban on child labour effective within five to 10 years.
A report by an ILO committee published yesterday urges the ILO to tighten
enforcement of international labour standards, singling out breaches of the
forced labour convention including forced child labour and child
prostitution. The ILO now relies mainly on moral persuasion and, in rare
cases, public condemnation.
The report calls for closer scrutiny of compliance with the core human
rights conventions, possible compensation for those adversely affected by
violations of ILO standards and voluntary mediation and arbitration.
