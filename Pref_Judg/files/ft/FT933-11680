Profits of the North of England Building Society slipped from Pounds 7.84m
to Pounds 7.69m pre-tax for the half year ended June 30. Provisions rose by
Pounds 387,000 to Pounds 787,000.
Directors said the rest of the year 'was not expected to be any easier' and
that current forecasts showed that profit was 'likely to be on a more modest
scale' than 1992's Pounds 16.7m.
