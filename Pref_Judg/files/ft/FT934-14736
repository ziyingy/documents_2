POWER Corp of Canada, the big financial services and communications group,
has linked with Hydro-Quebec and Ontario Hydro to form Asia Power, to
develop large electric power projects in China and other fast-developing
Asian countries.
Asia Power, owned one-third each by the partners and initially capitalised
at CDollars 100m (Pounds 49.2m), will have headquarters in Montreal but
operate from Hong Kong.
China early this year finally reversed its policy discouraging foreign
investment in infrastructure, including electric power. It is desperately
short of power for industrial development and estimates it needs Dollars
25bn (Pounds 16.5bn) in foreign investment in the area over the next eight
years.
Mr Paul Desmarais, chairman of Power Corp, which controls Pargesa with the
Belgian Frere family, has visited China regularly since 1979 and dropped
plans for a Guangdong pulp and paper mill because of lack of power.
He brought China International Trust &amp; Investment into a big British
Columbia pulp and paper project later. Power Corp now plans a China
communications project with Citic.
Canada led a Dollars 100m technical study of key parts of the Dollars 15bn
Three Gorges hydro project in China during the 1980s and Hydro-Quebec has
helped design several smaller hydro projects being built. Ontario Hydro has
also played an advisory role in China.
