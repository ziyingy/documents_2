AMONG the special properties of 'dry ice', or solidified carbon dioxide, are
its ability to change straight from a solid into a gas and to evaporate
leaving no residue.
Distillers MG, part of the German Messer Griesheim industrial gas group, has
devised a cryogenic system for industrial cleaning called Cold Jet which
uses dry ice to loosen and remove surface coatings.
The Cold Jet cleaning system uses small pellets of dry ice which are blown
in a stream of compressed air at the surface to be cleaned.
Thermal shock weakens the the bond of the coating or contamination, which is
then removed by the compressed air flow and slight attrition effect of dry
ice pellets. The pellets disintegrate on impact and sublime into a gas.
The system offers several advantages over conventional cleaning methods,
including speed, lower waste disposal costs, and hygienically clean
surfaces.
