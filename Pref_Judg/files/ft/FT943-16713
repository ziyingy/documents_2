If the results of two recent surveys are anything to go by, the diesel car
boom in Britain still has a long way to go.
Fleet Management Services, which runs many thousands of cars on behalf of
companies, puts diesel cars in four of the top five places in its 'best
value' league table. And although only 10 per cent of the 63,032 car owners
who responded to a nationwide survey for Volkswagen GB currently run
diesels, almost 30 per cent said they would buy one next time.
Most people know by now that diesel cars save a lot of fuel, especially if
they spend a fair amount of time in heavy traffic. Naturally, fleet
operators welcome lower fuel consumption. But the bottom line for them is
what a car will be worth at four years old with 80,000 miles (128,000km) on
the clock.
Using a five-year computer forecasting model, which had accurately predicted
falling residual values in the recession, FMS discovered that four of the
five best value fleet cars in Britain were diesels. First was the Citroen ZX
1.9D Reflex 5-door with total running costs - purchase price, funding, fuel,
maintenance and depreciation - of 18.84 pence per mile.
Second best was the Vauxhall Astra 1.7 D Merit 5-door (19.16p per mile),
followed by the Renault 19 1.4 RL Prima 5-door (19.3p and the only petrol
car in the five), Rover 218 D 5-door (19.99p) and Ford Escort 1.8 D 5-door
(20.05p).
Total running costs over four years and 80,000 miles ranged from Pounds
15,072 (Pounds 3,768 pa) for the Citroen to Pounds 16,040 (Pounds 4,010 pa)
for the Ford. The Astra cost Pounds 15,328 (Pounds 3,832), the Renault
Pounds 15,440 (Pounds 3,860) and the Rover, Pounds 15,992 (Pounds 3,998).
The most important single factor in running costs is how quickly the car's
value depreciates. This is something many private buyers, while agonising
over dealer discounts and fuel consumption, tend to ignore. Cheapest of the
five to buy was the Renault (Pounds 8,695 recommended retail) and the
dearest, the Rover at Pounds 10,205. Other prices were: Citroen ZX Pounds
9,345; Escort Pounds 9,800; Astra Pounds 9,995. The Astra was the cheapest
to maintain, the Rover the dearest, but the difference this made to overall
running costs was marginal.
The idea of VW GB's survey was to find out what people expected from the new
cars they would buy over the next 10 or 20 years. Apart from diesel economy,
occupant protection and vehicle security were main concerns.
Perhaps surprisingly, most of the emphasis was on passive safety -
mitigating the effects of a crash - and not on active safety features that
might help a driver to avoid having a collision at all. Almost 80 per cent
wanted airbags and a crash-activated switch to cut off the fuel pump.
Speed limiters were demanded by fewer than 40 per cent, sensors to tell
drivers they are travelling too close to the vehicle in front by about 50
per cent.
Some company car users, with tax saving in mind, have started trading down
to smaller, cheaper models. But the trend among retail buyers may be the
other way. They could be going for larger, more practical cars; more than 20
per cent said they would prefer an estate as household transport.
Increasing car crime put car security high on the agenda. Nine in 10 of
those surveyed wanted an engine immobiliser as standard equipment; 65 per
cent opted for a computerised tracking device (already offered as an extra
by BMW and Saab) to locate a car after it had been stolen.
Next week, the two-month consultation period on Ministry of Transport
proposals to ban coaches from the outside lane of three-lane motorways ends.
Under a European Commission directive, all coaches will be speed-limited to
65mph/105kph from 1996; at the moment, they must not exceed 70mph, but many
often do.
Most motorists would be delighted to see them banned from the third lane -
the sooner the better. For good measure, heavy lorries (already limited in
theory if not always in practice to 60mph/97kph) should be kept out of both
of the outer lanes of the M25 and other motorways that have been converted
to four lanes.
Saab and Volvo already have rear centre armrests that double as child safety
seats. BMW plans to go further and will offer, probably next year,
integrated (but easily removable) safety seats, adjustable for children
between nine months and 12 years. They have foot rests, to stop the backs of
the front seats from being kicked, and side supports to prevent sleeping
heads from lolling uncomfortably. Other ideas BMW has for the family car are
fold-out tables with low-line reading lights, that will not reflect in the
windscreen, and storage boxes. These can also be plugged into the electrical
system to cool drinks or warm babies' bottles.
