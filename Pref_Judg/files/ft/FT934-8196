The North American Free Trade Agreement would gradually eliminate almost all
trade and investment restrictions between the US, Canada and Mexico over 15
years. Side agreements, concluded in August, require the enforcement of
environmental and some labour laws, under penalty of fines or sanctions.
The US and Canada entered a free trade agreement in 1989, and the pact would
thus mainly affect trade and investment with Mexico. Nafta is intended to
come into effect on January 1, although a delay is allowed for.
The Canadian Parliament has already approved the agreement. The US House of
Representatives is scheduled to vote on it today and the US Senate some time
after. The Mexican Senate, dominated by the country's governing party, will
vote on Nafta after the vote in the US House of Representatives.
