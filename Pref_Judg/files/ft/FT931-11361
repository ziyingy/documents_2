A COMPLETE review of health and safety legislation, with the object of
reducing the regulatory burden on small businesses, was announced by the
Department of Employment yesterday.
The Health and Safety Commission is to report by the end of March to Mr
Michael Forsyth, the Department of Employment minister charged with
combating red tape, on how it plans to carry out the review.
The scope for wholesale deregulation is limited because of European
Community directives on health and safety. From January 1 businesses were
faced with six new pieces of legislation covering everything from visual
display units to the lifting of heavy weights.
Some defunct regulations were taken off the statute book at the same time -
the 1927 Gut Scraping and Tripe Dressing Regulations, for example.
However, the Confederation of British Industry feels the net effect has been
to increase the level of prescriptive legislation in recent years. Mr John
Cridland, CBI health and safety director, said it was no use talking of
deregulation on a domestic level when more red tape had already been agreed
to in Brussels.
The department also pointed out the abolition of Wages Councils would 'free
over a quarter of a million employers from statutory wage fixing'.
