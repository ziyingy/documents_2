Colombia's constitutional court has overturned existing legislation and
decriminalised the use of some drugs, including marijuana and cocaine,
Sarita Kendall reports from Bogota. Despite strong criticism from the
government and many sectors of society, the decision is expected to become
official next week. The production, distribution and sale of drugs remains
illegal.
President Cesar Gaviria warned that the decision could lead to worse
violence and said he hoped the court would leave room for congress to limit
drug consumption in schools and public places.
Horrified parents and teachers have been calling in to local radios to
protest.
