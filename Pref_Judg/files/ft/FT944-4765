The Accounting Standards Board has confirmed that it will defer aspects of
one of its financial reporting rules in certain areas of insurance.
Financial Reporting Standard 5, which is designed to make company
transactions reflect their real substance, not merely their legal form, will
be deferred for two years for insurance broking transactions and financial
reinsurance included in the accounts of Lloyd's syndicates.
