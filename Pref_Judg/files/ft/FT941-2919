Sir, Gerald Kaufman's review of the newly published history of the Jewish
Chronicle conveys a misleading picture of the book, the newspaper, and of my
predecessor in the editor's chair, Geoffrey Paul (Books: 'Life and times of
a paper tiger', March 12).
Mr Kaufman is right to say that there have been occasions during the
newspaper's long history when it has been reticent to speak out on various
issues - indeed, with benefit of hindsight, perhaps too reticent. Given the
fact that, at 153 years of age, we are the fourth oldest weekly paper in
Britain, that is only to be expected.
But overwhelmingly, our record has been - and continues to be - one of
fiercely guarded editorial independence and consistently probing commentary
on communal, national and international issues. In this, the newspaper is
unique among Jewish publications worldwide, and the equal of the most
distinguished of Britain's national newspapers. The book Mr Kaufman reviewed
makes this point forcefully, also noting the Jewish Chronicle's central role
in a community whose large majority, regardless of political or religious
persuasion, reads the paper each week.
The comment attributed by Mr Kaufman to my predecessor that the newspaper
'could not run ahead of its readership' was made in the context of one quite
specific issue: a deep dispute within the Orthodox Jewish establishment in
the 1960s which led, ultimately, to a schism within it. Indeed, Mr Paul,
himself, spoke out courageously on a number of issues even when this meant
challenging the views of communal institutions, or of readers, a fact
reflected in the often stormy debate that has always marked our letters
pages.
