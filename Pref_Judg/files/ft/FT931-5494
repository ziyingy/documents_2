A Pounds 146.7m write-down in property values, particularly office blocks in
London and other UK cities, reduced Ladbroke Group's pre-tax profit to
Pounds 5.2m last year, down from Pounds 146.3m.
The write-down represented 15 per cent of Ladbroke's near Pounds 1bn
investment property portfolio. Previous provisions had exhausted its
revaluation reserve. Mr Cyril Stein, chairman, said: 'We don't expect to
have property provisions again this year.'
The numbers reported under the new accounting standard FRS 3 were also
reduced by a change in the way profits are calculated on sales of hotels and
properties. This knocked Pounds 34.9m off last year's pre-tax profit figure
and Pounds 64.1m off the Pounds 210.4m recorded for 1991.
Ladbroke, which owns Hilton International hotels, Texas Homecare DIY stores
and various betting businesses, maintained its final dividend at 6.23p to
give a total of 11.15p. The Pounds 121m bill comes out of reserves as the
group finished up with losses per share of 3.11p (9.91p earnings).
Mr Stein, said: 'We have not reduced the dividend since the business started
in 1967. The property write-down is not cash and we have substantial
reserves.'
Operating profit was 3 per cent up at Pounds 252.5m (Pounds 245.6m) on sales
of Pounds 4.17bn (Pounds 3.82bn).
Margins were squeezed in the Hilton International chain as, for most of the
year, weakness in the dollar and the yen deterred American and Japanese
travellers.
Hotels' operating profit (pre-FRS 3) slipped from Pounds 163.8m to Pounds
151.7m, on turnover of Pounds 901.8m (Pounds 758.1m), in spite of an Pounds
11m currency gain. The profit on hotel sales fell by nearly Pounds 5m to
Pounds 38.9m.
Mr Stein said there would still be some profits from disposals this year
after applying the new rules - which made no difference to the cash going
into the bank. Hotel book values had been reduced by Pounds 195.6m, taken
from the revaluation reserve.
The racing division enjoyed a recovery in the UK. Profit improved to Pounds
64.8m (Pounds 64.5m), on sales of Pounds 2.41bn (Pounds 2.25bn), after
Pounds 8m charges for closures in Flanders and Minnesota. On the latter Mr
Stein said: 'We have been scalped by the indians,' referring to casinos on
nearby reservations.
Texas Homecare, the star performer in the first half, suffered along with
other retailers after Black Wednesday. Profit fell to Pounds 43.8m (Pounds
47.5m) on turnover of Pounds 693.8m (Pounds 652.9m). Interest charges
amounted to Pounds 105.6m (Pounds 101.8m). Of this, Pounds 67.5m was
accounted for by property, taking that division's post-interest loss to
Pounds 35.4m (Pounds 12.4m). Capitalised interest was cut to Pounds 7m
(Pounds 147.5m).
Net debt rose to Pounds 1.34bn (Pounds 1.2bn) including Pounds 83m of
convertible capital bonds - in line with Accounting Standards Board
proposals. The devaluation of sterling added Pounds 195.5m to borrowings in
translation.
The rise in gearing from 35 to 53 per cent also reflected a Pounds 340m
reduction in shareholders' funds to Pounds 2.51bn.
