BRITAIN and Ireland will, from 1994, scrap quarantine on the small number of
cats and dogs sold into those countries, replacing it with a system of
highly complicated rabies checks.
Mr John Gummer, the UK agriculture minister, described the agreement, made
with his EC counterparts yesterday, as 'a very major advance' on other
schemes proposed by Brussels.
In its plan to create the single EC market from next year on, the European
Commission is seeking the abolition of border controls on animals, as well
as people and goods.
The new system relies on a distinction between pets travelling with their
owners, and those imported by traders.
The former category would remain subject to quarantine, Mr Gummer stressed.
