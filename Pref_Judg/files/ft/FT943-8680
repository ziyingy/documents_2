A vacancy has arisen at the very highest level of international terrorism
and search consultants have been retained to identify the individual with a
unique combination of talents.
The successful candidate must have a wide experience of handling small arms
from many parts of the world and knowledge of explosives would also be an
advantage. An ability to threaten in several languages is an essential
requirement, as is the ability to think quickly and clearly under fire.
Candidates should be of a flexible political disposition and prepared to
undertake operations for several interested parties at short notice. A
mysterious background which can excite international media attention would
also count highly. Don't ring us, we'll ring you.
