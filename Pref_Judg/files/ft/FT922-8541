THE SUPPLY of physics graduates is falling well short of demand for
qualified physicists, and the position is likely to worsen, the Institute of
Physics said yesterday.
Launching a 'campaign for physics', the institute said that the number of
physics-based enterprises in the UK expanded from 20,000 to more than 31,500
in the 1980s, while in 1993 the number of new physics graduates would be
only 13 higher than in 1983.
