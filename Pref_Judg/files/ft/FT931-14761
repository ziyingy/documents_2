BRITISH AIRWAYS is to offer first-class passengers navy blue pyjamas, a
duvet and a hot milky drink on some overnight flights from next week.
Passengers from New York's Kennedy airport will also be fed while still on
the ground so that they can sleep on the aircraft without interruption.
BA's move may signal the stepping up of the airline's efforts to woo
top-paying passengers. BA's rival, Virgin Atlantic, to which it apologised
earlier this week in the High Court over the 'dirty tricks' affair, has an
in-flight beauty therapist on some flights to Los Angeles.
BA's 'sleeper trials' are the result of customer research which showed that
what passengers wanted above all was a long sleep. 'And they want a nice
milky drink, crisp sheets and a proper-sized pillow,' said the airline.
If the trial succeeds the airline will from April extend the service to many
flights of less than nine hours which fly east after 7pm, although only
passengers from Kennedy airport or Heathrow will be able to enjoy the
pre-flight meal.
BA's 'sleeper trials' recall the 1950s, when passengers could sleep in bunks
on the Boeing Stratocruiser, a propeller aircraft derived from the B-29
bomber and notorious for its noise and vibration.
Since then, sleeping on aircraft has remained a trial, even in first class.
Only Philippine Airlines still offers bunk beds to first class passengers -
on Tuesday flights from London to Manila and more often on trans-Pacific
routes.
Japan Airlines gave up offering bunks on flights to Europe when the
increasing range of modern aircraft allowed it to fly non-stop from Tokyo.
Its inducements now include dressing first-class passengers in colourful
quilted 'happi coats' and the use of a personal massage machine.
