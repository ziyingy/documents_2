Rolls-Royce, the aero-engine and industrial power group, is to shed an
additional 1,000 jobs in its UK aerospace operations next year because of
continuing difficult trading conditions in both its civil and defence
aero-engine businesses.
The latest restructuring will increase the total number of job cuts in its
aerospace activities to 3,000 next year on top of the 3,000 jobs it is
losing this year.
