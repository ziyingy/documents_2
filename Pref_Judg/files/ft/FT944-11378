Senior businesspeople yes-terday came out strongly in favour of a European
Union built on the disciplines of the single market.
They dismissed the suggestion by Mr Norman Lamont, former chancellor, at the
Tory party conference that the UK could withdraw from the EU.
Results of a survey of more than 200 chief executives and chairmen,
published at the annual conference of the Confederation of British Industry
in Birmingham, were a sharp rebuff to Tory Euro-sceptics.
Government moves on the development of the EU have been made with ministers
wary of the responses of Euro-sceptics, who are numerous enough to deprive
the Tories of their parliamentary majority.
The survey showed that 58 per cent of the business leaders supported an EU
based on the single market, with freedom for member states to adopt other
common policies according to their circumstances.
Another 29 per cent went further than that, wanting member states to set
common policy objectives but to retain their flexibility about the timing of
adoption.
Mr Davies said the poll showed business 'is comfortable about economic and
monetary union as long as it is properly planned'. Monetary union is
anathema to Conservative opponents of the EU.
For 28 per cent of the business leaders a single currency is necessary to
the successful long-term working of the single market. For 56 per cent a
single currency is a long-term help, but not a necessity.
While the CBI has been seeking to stiffen the government's European sinews,
business leaders have said they are not getting the full benefits of the
single market. They want more deregulation, less interference in competition
from state subsidies, the extension of the single market to the energy and
telecommunications sectors and reform of the Common Agricultural Policy.
