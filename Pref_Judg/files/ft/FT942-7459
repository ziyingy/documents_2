Varity Corporation, which makes braking systems and diesel engines for cars
and trucks, reported an increase in first-quarter net income to Dollars
29.4m, or 65 cents a share, on sales of Dollars 505.8m.
This compares with Dollars 11m, or 20 cents a share, on sales of Dollars
455.6m in last year's first quarter.
During the quarter to April 30, Varity agreed to sell its remaining Massey
Ferguson farm equipment operations to Agco for Dollars 310m in cash and
500,000 shares of Agco stock.
The sale, expected to be completed during the current quarter, should bring
an income gain of between Dollars 15m and Dollars 30m and increase Varity's
stockholders' equity by about Dollars 100m, the company said.
Varity's first-quarter income, excluding Massey Ferguson's results, was
Dollars 25m, or 55 cents, up from a comparable Dollars 15.1m, or 33 cents, a
year ago.
Massey Ferguson's results, reported separately as discontinued operations,
showed that the farm equipment business improved, with net income rising to
Dollars 4m in the first quarter, against a net loss of Dollars 4m a year
ago. Sales were Dollars 253m, up from Dollars 189m last year.
Varity's remaining businesses benefited from a 9 per cent increase in North
American vehicle production. Its Kelsey-Hayes automotive products group
generated Dollars 27m in operating income on sales of Dollars 355m, up from
Dollars 25m on sales of Dollars 302m in last year's first quarter.
The Perkins Engine division saw operating income rise to Dollars 13m, from
Dollars 8m a year ago, with sales advancing to Dollars 180m, from Dollars
158m in the first quarter of 1993.
'Varity is off to a good start this year,' said Mr Victor Rice, Varity
chairman. 'With the recently announced sale of Massey Ferguson, we are now
positioned to focus on generating even more value for our shareholders from
our core businesses of supplying automotive braking systems and diesel
engines to customers worldwide.'
