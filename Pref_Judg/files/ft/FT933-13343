One strand of ethnic minority business promotion to receive attention in
recent years has been the creation of links between black-owned businesses
in the UK and North America.
As part of this development the North London Business Development Agency
will be leading its fourth trade mission to take part in Minority Enterprise
Development Week in Atlanta, Georgia on September 25.
The agency expects to take a dozen UK business managers to Atlanta for up to
10 days at a cost of about Pounds 1,500 each. Previous visits have led to
orders being placed for UK products. The mission is open to business owners
from throughout the UK.
Contact the agency at 35-37 Blackstock Road, London N4 2JF. Tel. 071 359
