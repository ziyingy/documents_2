MR Michael Heseltine, the trade and industry secretary, told MPs yesterday
that British Coal is honouring its promise not to let 10 pits earmarked for
closure deteriorate to a point where they could not be worked.
Mr Heseltine was pressed by Mr Robin Cook, shadow trade and industry
secretary, on reports that some of the 10 collieries not included in the
shutdown moratorium were already being stripped of equipment or neglected.
Mr Cook urged him to keep the pits working while British Coal carried out
its statutory 90 days' consultation.
Mr Heseltine said there was no market for the coal with stockpiles at
pitheads and power stations.
He added that some MPs suggested to his department that British Coal was not
honouring its commitment to care and maintenance so that if its consultation
determined the pits should stay open, they could do so.
'I have personally investigated every suggestion that has been put to me,'
he said, 'and I am satisfied on the assurances given by British Coal that
none of the 10 pits has been prejudiced should the outcome of the
consultations indicate their continued life.'
Mr Tim Eggar, industry minister, insisted that Colombia's authorities had
assured him that none of the coal it exported to Britain was mined by child
labour.
