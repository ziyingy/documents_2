Sir, We warmly welcome the contribution made by Prof Main of Edinburgh
University to the debate on how to improve the quality of boardroom practice
('Committee boost to top pay seen', June 29).
However, it is important to put into context some of his remarks about the
efficacy of remuneration committees if companies are to derive the real
benefits which such committees can achieve.
First, these are early days for remuneration committees. It is easy to
forget how recently and how quickly the interest on matters of corporate
governance has developed.
Prof Main's research, to which we contributed, was largely conducted before
Pro Ned had issued its Guidelines on Remuneration Committees and when media
attention on the issue had yet to gather steam.
At the time, our guidelines, which were sent to more than 2,000 chairmen and
chief executives, were welcomed because committees were unsure about what
they ought to be doing. Interest has been so great that we have since been
asked for a further 3,000 copies.
Second, we firmly believe in soundly constituted remuneration committees and
the issue now is how to help companies find the best ways to make these
committees work. The key here is who sits on the committee and how they are
appointed.
The system will only work properly under the following conditions:
where there is a separate chairman;
where non-executive directors are appointed by a nomination committee and
are of sufficient calibre to be independent;
where shareholders make their views on remuneration known and the chairman
of the committee has to answer them at the annual general meeting.
It is important to encourage remuneration committees and then to set about
improving their operation.
That is what Pro Ned aims to do.
