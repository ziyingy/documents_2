NEARLY half a million people around the world are officially reported to
have Aids, but a UN agency says this was just a third of the estimated
total, and up to 11m people carry the HIV virus, Reuter reports from Geneva.
Reported cases of the fatal disease rose by 28,278 in the last quarter of
1991, reaching a global total of 446,681 victims in 163 countries, the World
Health Organisation reported yesterday.
The US reported 15,541 new cases, Tanzania 6,188 and Europe 4,017 new cases.
The WHO says officially reported cases are only a fraction of the true
total.
It estimates that some 1.5m people have contracted Aids, while between 9m
and 11m are infected with the HIV virus which causes the disease.
