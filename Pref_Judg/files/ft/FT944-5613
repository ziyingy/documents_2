Seeboard set a strong pace for the new regional electricity results season
yesterday by disclosing a 28 per cent increase in underlying half-year
pre-tax profits, and a 21 per cent rise in the interim dividend.
And the Crawley-based company linked the results to further benefits for its
customers, which it valued at Pounds 22m.
Seeboard, which serves south-east England, reported profits for the six
months to September 30 of Pounds 33.5m (Pounds 36.3m) after a Pounds 12.8m
charge for a premium paid to redeem Pounds 54m of government debt ahead of
time.
Turnover was Pounds 509.3m (Pounds 534.3m). The interim dividend is raised
to 4p (3.3p) from earnings per share of 9.1p (10.15p).
Sir Keith Stuart, chairman, said the results reflected the cost reductions
which Seeboard had achieved over the last 18 months through job cuts and
greater efficiency. The dividend increase was 'generous, but we can afford
to pay it, and we're doing the customers proud too'.
Seeboard will be reducing its quarterly standing charge by Pounds 2.50 or 20
per cent from next February. It will also pay each customer a special rebate
of Pounds 1 out of the interest earned on the Pounds 70m received in VAT
prepayments earlier this year. Other improvements include an increase in the
direct debit discount from Pounds 3 to Pounds 4, and a free bill-paying
service through the post office.
Although Seeboard is obliged by the new price regulations to cut prices for
its customers next year, Sir Keith said these measures would deliver the
benefits 'ahead of time'. Since privatisation in 1989, he said Seeboard
customers had seen a 16 per cent reduction in electricity bills in real
terms.
Among the divisional operations, the distribution business made an operating
profit of Pounds 43.6m (Pounds 39.3m). The supply business reported a
reduced loss of Pounds 4.2m (Pounds 6.7m), while in the retail, contracting
and gas sales businesses, improved trading margins led to better results.
