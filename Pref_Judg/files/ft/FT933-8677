THE NEW side agreements to the North American Free Trade Agreement
negotiated by the US, Mexico and Canada lay down principles and objectives
for labour and environmental protection standards in the three countries.
But they also establish a disputes procedure that trade ministers claim will
give real bite to the pact.
'These are historic, groundbreaking agreements and have real teeth,' Mr
Mickey Kantor, the US Trade Representative, said yesterday.
The disputes procedure has been the main sticking point in negotiations over
the last week, with Canada firmly resisting US demands for trade sanctions
to be levied if a country does not live up to its obligations under Nafta.
Telephone talks dragged from Monday, when formal negotiations broke up,
until early yesterday morning, before a compromise was found that accepts a
different procedure for Canada than that applied to the US and Mexico.
The disputes mechanism aims to punish the failure by central or local
governments in the three countries to enforce their own labour or
environmental laws, rather than the actual breach of those laws by a company
or individual.
If complaints of non-enforcement brought by one country against another
cannot be satisfied by consultations, an arbitration panel of experts may be
set up, on the vote of two out of the three Nafta signatories.
This panel can rule that a country 'has engaged in a persistent pattern of
failure to effectively enforce.' If no action plan to remedy this failure
can be agreed on, it can then fine the offending government up to Dollars
20m - a maximum that will be adjusted upwards as the volume of trade between
the three countries increases.
The split between the negotiators involved the action that would be taken if
a country refused to pay this fine or continued in its failure to enforce
its labour or environmental laws.
If the US or Mexico defies a panel ruling, the complaining country may
impose trade sanctions by suspending the Nafta benefits in proportion to the
amount of the fine. This would in effect mean tariffs being raised back
towards pre-Nafta levels in specified areas.
Canada, however, has insisted that its own courts should enforce the fine
and the action plan.
'The Canadians, with I think some credibility, said their courts were
perfectly competent to enforce these orders,' said Mr Kantor, adding that
the Canadian courts would not be able to review or hear appeals against a
Nafta panel ruling.
The key principles of the labour agreement - clearly targeted at Mexico -
require each country to promote freedom of association, the right to strike
and to bargain collectively, a ban on forced labour, restrictions on child
labour, equal pay for men and women, compensation for work accidents and the
protection of migrant workers.
While the disputes procedure takes aim only at a country's failure to
enforce its laws, rather than at any possible inadequacy in those laws, the
Nafta does require each signatory to improve working conditions and living
standards over time, with annual reviews set up under the side agreements.
US trade unions have been critical of Nafta, which they believe will allow
Mexico to suck jobs away from the US because of lower wages and weaker
worker protection and safety standards.
Conservation groups have complained that the treaty would encourage
companies to set up dirty factories on the Mexican side of the border, where
they would be subjected to lower pollution control standards.
The environmental pact does not set out a list of principles, but the three
countries commit themselves to high levels of environmental protection.
Under the agreements, no country may lower its standards of environmental or
labour protection: new laws must set higher standards.
Mexico and the US also agreed to set up a border environment institution to
co-ordinate and finance action on water and solid waste pollution in the
region along their common frontier.
No agreement has yet been reached on the amount of money needed for this -
estimates have ranged from around Dollars 7bn to Dollars 30bn - but Mr
Kantor insisted this would be completed in time for the whole Nafta
agreement to be submitted formally to the US Congress in September.
