Hydro-Quebec, one of Canada's two biggest power utilities, has developed a
hybrid electric car technology that it says will reduce emissions and
increase energy efficiency.
Hydro, best known for long-distance power transmission, electro-chemical and
battery research, has unveiled its Couture Powertrain system, which runs on
electric batteries backed up by a small gasoline engine. It has spent
CDollars 22m (Pounds 9.8m) since 1991 proving technical feasibility and will
spend a further CDollars 50m to reach the commercialisation phase.
The hybrid traction system, designed and developed by researcher Pierre
Couture, uses high-efficiency batteries to drive electric motors in each of
a car's four wheels. A conventional gearbox, differential, drive shaft and
gasoline engine are not needed.
A small gasoline engine recharges the batteries. The whole system, including
central generator-motor, is computer controlled. It has a 30hp, two-stroke
gasoline engine, with a catalytic converter. The engine runs for a maximum
of 30 minutes per hour of driving.
Couture says the system offers twice a conventional (internal combustion
engine) car's energy efficiency, reduces emissions and makes significant
savings in materials. Total vehicle weight is about the same as conventional
cars. Manufacturing costs could be less.
Hydro is testing the technology on a standard Chrysler Intrepid sedan. Its
rear wheels are driven by individual electric motors powered by batteries
kept in the boot. The normal frontwheel drive system is disengaged.
Many groups are working on electric cars and hybrids worldwide. Recent US
research shows that better design and electronics could raise average
mileage per gallon to 46, or 65 per cent, according to research, but this is
likely to add Dollars 1,000 (Pounds 610) to the cost.
