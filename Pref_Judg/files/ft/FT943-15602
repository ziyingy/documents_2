The UK government should undertake a wide-ranging study of the relationship
between the tax system and industrial innovation, the Advisory Council on
Science and Technology says in its final report this week, Clive Cookson
writes. (Acost has been replaced by the Council for Science and Technology.)
Acost's report is the latest in a series by influential bodies calling for
government action to stimulate research and development by more favourable
tax treatment for R&amp;D. The Commons Committee on Science and Technology made
a similar recommendation earlier this year.
