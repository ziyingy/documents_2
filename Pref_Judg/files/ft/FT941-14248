Ships' officers, excluding masters, employed by P&amp;O European Ferries
yesterday voted to strike against the company's sweeping reform of
employment contracts, Robert Taylor writes.
The changes are designed to make cost savings on services from Felixstowe in
Suffolk, to Larne in Northern Ireland and Cairnryan in south-west Scotland.
Workers at the three ports have agreed not to take ships to sea or provide
services for limited periods not exceeding 24 hours. The action was passed
by 121 votes to 23, by P&amp;O members of Numast, the merchant navy officers'
union.
Today P&amp;O managers are due to meet officials from the RMT transport union to
try to prevent strike action by crews on the same ferry services. The crews
are opposed to the radical changes in working hours and to a pay freeze.
Yesterday's decision will add to pressure on the company to modify its
cost-cutting plans. P&amp;O has already threatened to dismiss employees who
strike or refuse to accept the new terms.
Numast is concerned at the safety implications of some of the changes, with
officers working longer hours.
