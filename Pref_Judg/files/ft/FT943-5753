Consultations on whether clergy should become subject to conventional
employment contracts are to be conducted by the the Church of England.
At present more than two-thirds of the Church's stipendiary clergy are in
post on the basis of the ecclesiastical freehold, meaning they cannot be
moved against their will. A steering group on conditions of service decided
this week to consult dioceses on seven possible alternative arrangements.
The church's policy-making General Synod will debate the issue next year.
