Ann Widdecombe, a junior social security minister and a leading opponent of
the ordination of women in the Church of England, yesterday attended a
service at the Roman Catholic Westminister Cathedral in London.
Yesterday's Sunday services were the first since the vote by the general
synod of the Church of England in favour of allowing the ordination of
women.
Miss Widdecombe has left the Church of England and said many other people
were in the same 'self-imposed excommunication'.
She added: 'Today I come as a visitor from nowhere.'
Dr George Carey, archbishop of Canterbury, said on BBC Radio that he would
be amazed if many people left the church because of the vote.
