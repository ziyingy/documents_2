'BUENOS DIAS]' There was a rattle at the door, a key turned, a floorboard
creaked by my bedside.
'Buenos dias]' it came again, a cheerful, determined voice. A cup of tea was
set on the bedside table. 'Eight o'clock, morning tea. Breakfast in 30
minutes precisely. Hasta la vista]' The voice retreated, the door closed.
I focused on the ceiling. I was not, so far as I knew, in Spain, but
Cornwall. This was not Fawlty Towers but a bed-and-breakfast called Dunoon.
The man bringing tea was not Manuel, but David Castle, Cornishman, retired
military man, and the proprietor of Dunoon.
Outside, the wind alternately sighed and screamed in the telephone wires.
Seagulls cried faintly. Far below the house, at the bottom of the cliffs,
sea waves crashed against the rocks. I drifted back to sleep, for 30 minutes
precisely.
'Ocho y media]' Ocho y media]' A terrific din broke out at the bottom of the
stairs. David Castle was vigorously swinging a large bell. 'Eight thirty]'
he shouted up. 'Breakfast is on the table]' Like a new recruit I swung into
my trousers, fumbled my way into shoes and shirt, and tumbled down the
stairs.
***
David Castle, it turned out, is not completely potty, just enthusiastic
about beginning a new life in Spain. He has lived most of his life in Port
Isaac, and had enough of its moaning winds, plaintive seagulls,
cliff-crashing waves and winter isolation. He knows that other, milder
worlds exist.
As a young man his military career took him to the Mediterranean, and over
the years he has made holiday escapes to Menorca no fewer than 16 times. Now
he is ready to buy his dream house there. Dunoon is up for sale, and he is
taking Spanish lessons in preparation for his departure. Far to the south, a
gentle land of sunshine, Aertex shirts and golden beaches is waiting.
To an urban visitor like me, of course, the wild maritime terrain, bracing
climate and out-of-season isolation is the whole point of going to a place
like Port Isaac. There are few spots left on the English coast, especially
in the vacationland of the south-west, that have not been over-run by
tourist mobs, seafront amusement arcades and sticks of rock. Your chances of
stumbling across a quaint Cornish fishing village are about as good as
getting an authentic Cornish pasty from a dispensing machine at a motorway
snack bar. Both exist, both are almost impossible to find.
But Port Isaac is about as close to the ideal as you can come these days.
Here on the rugged North Cornwall coast, a 40-minute drive around the Camel
estuary from Padstow, topography and a local conservation order have saved
Port Isaac from over-development. There is no coastal road along this shore,
for unlike other parts of Cornwall there are few sheltered harbours, sandy
beaches or means of access to the sea. Precipitous 200-ft cliffs range the
shoreline; sturdy sheep, occasional cliff-path walkers and the odd tractor
are the only company you will run across.
July and August see an influx of summer tourists to Port Isaac, but even
that has its limits. Built into a rocky, high-sided inlet, the village and
everything about it is steep and tiny. Seventeenth-century slate and stone
houses built on different levels cluster round a miniature walled harbour.
Crooked lanes tail away into stepped footpaths. With many streets barely 6
ft wide, parking near the port is impossible except in the harbour-floor
'tidal parking lot' - an option with nasty consequences for all but the
shortest of short-term holiday-makers.
If topography is one limitation to tourism, so is weather. This is one of
the windiest places in Britain - so windy, in fact, that the country's first
electricity-generating wind-farm, a futuristic vision of vast, winged
turbines, sits not far inland. An ever-present, inescapable element, the
wind batters the cliffs, deforms bushes into ragged, lop-sided shapes, and
brings in ocean storms with lightning speed. But for those who like the
wilder, more unpredictable side of nature, cliff, sea, wind and storm all
make for a grand show.
I began not with a natural, but a human show. After breakfast I set off in a
blustery wind for Tintagel - better known to lovers of Arthurian legend as
Camelot - half-an-hour away by car.
Although there is not much left of the castle at Tintagel, its site is
romantic enough. Perched high over the roaring sea on a headland connected
to the shore by the thinnest neck of rock, it is a wild place where, among
crags and ruins, one can imagine Arthur and his knights gathered at the
Round Table.
Unfortunately, not a scrap of evidence exists to show that King Arthur ever
set foot in the place. If it was the 12th-century Geoffrey of Monmouth who
invented the famous legends several hundred years after Arthur was supposed
to have lived, and Thomas Mallory who popularised them some 300 years after
that, it was a visit to Tintagel by Tennyson, and his subsequent Morte
d'Arthur, that linked this place to the myth.
More unfortunately still, the Round Table in Tintagel these days is not a
round table at all, but a bandwagon. The town's King Arthur's Hall of
Chivalry is only the beginning of it. As I walked back from the castle to my
car, I passed just a few of the establishments cashing in on the legend:
King Arthur's Bookshop, King Arthur's Cafe, the Pendragon Gallery, Merlin's
Gift Shop, the King Arthur's Arms. If there is a Chinese laundry in
Tintagel, it probably has an Arthurian name.
Very different was a long cliff walk the next day around Pentire Point and
along the Camel river estuary to the Padstow ferry. It is a hike that took
me through some of the most colourful, and this time authentic, chapters of
Cornish tradition.
This was once one of the most dangerous coasts in England. From St Ives Bay
to the Devon border extends a rocky, exposed shore which, for more than 80
miles, has no safe harbour where ships could run in rough weather. Sailing
vessels were wrecked along here by the hundreds, and the Cornish population
developed as fearsome a reputation for 'wrecking' as for smuggling. Wreckers
were opportunists who, from the cliff-tops, would follow a ship in trouble
until it foundered and was driven ashore, then strip it of everything from
cargo to cabin doors.
There are many dark tales of wreckers deliberately luring ships to
destruction. On stormy nights, it is said, they would tie a lamp to a cow's
tail and send it wandering off along the cliffs. Swinging to and fro like a
ship's masthead light, it would draw vessels and their crews to certain
death.
Padstow Bay and the mouth of the Camel estuary would appear to be one of the
few safe havens along this coast, but in fact it was one of the most
dangerous traps of all. This is the site of the dreaded Doom Bar, a broad
expanse of sand stretching across the estuary mouth, through which only one
narrow deepwater channel existed. If the name of that worthy organisation,
the Padstow Harbour Association for the Preservation of Life and Property
from Shipwreck, was somewhat long and awkward for use in split-second
emergencies, it was none the less successful in rescuing many a mariner from
a watery end on the Doom Bar.
I saw no wrecks on the day I walked along the sands at low tide, just the
wind-whipped little church of Saint Enodoc, where John Betjeman is buried,
and scores of bright orange and yellow wind-surfers making spectacular leaps
over the waves of Padstow Bay. While the town of Padstow may no longer have
to save vast numbers of sailors, it continues an equally admirable service;
at Granny's Pasty Shop near the waterfront it makes a pasty that any
Cornishman would be proud of.
The most pleasurable part of a stay in Port Isaac, though, is simply
spending time around Port Isaac itself. Not even dirty weather detracts from
the atmosphere; it adds to it. Down at the tiny harbour, locals stand about
stacked lobster pots in the drizzle, talking fish. In the Port Isaac
fisherman's co-op you can take refuge from spring gales and buy some of the
finest cooked crabs around. In the Golden Lion on wet and foggy Saturday
nights you can sip a pint and listen to wildly Celtic fiddle-playing.
And on the hill at a wind-battered house called Dunoon, of course, you can
practise your Spanish with a man who would give it all up, just for a bit of
sunshine.
