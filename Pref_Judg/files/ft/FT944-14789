A software package to help computer game addicts to create their own games
has been launched by a UK educational software manufacturer.
Klik &amp; Play uses a simple programming language which aims to lead the user
through the steps of game creation via a Windows interface. The
manufacturers claim that novices can create a simple game in minutes, while
experienced users can write sophisticated games in a fraction of the time
needed with conventional programming languages.
Europress Software is selling Klik &amp; Play for Pounds 39.99 on floppy disc
and for Pounds 44.99 on compact disc.
