THE London Commodity Exchange launches its revamped raw sugar futures
contract today amid hopes that the new premium contract will succeed where
its previous product failed.
The exchange is taking advantage of widespread disaffection with the
contract traded at the Coffee, Sugar and Cocoa Exchange in New York. Traders
were angered by a decision in July to allow Brazilian crystal sugar to be
delivered against the raw sugar contract.
The LCE has deliberately excluded Brazilian crystal - which many traders
doubt should be classed as raw sugar - and Cuban sugar from its new
contract. The contract will be denominated in cents a lb rather than dollars
a tonne in order to make it more similar to the New York futures contract
and thus to facilitate arbitraging between the two markets.
It has also changed the delivery months to fit in more closely with the
physical trade in raw sugar. Mr Robin Woodhead, chief executive of the LCE
said: 'We're very pleased with the levels of support we're seeing,
particularly from the trade in the US and the Far East.'
The new contract will be traded on-screen alongside the exchange's white
sugar futures and Mr Woodhead said the decision to trade it on screen had
resulted in two new requests from traders to join the system.
The previous contract had also been traded on screen, but, in an effort to
boost liquidity, the exchange moved it to open outcry trading. This failed
to increase volume. however, and the contract was de-listed earlier this
year.
'There are still a lot of pessimistic people out there because they've seen
some tough times in recent years trying to get London going,' said Mr John
Payne, sugar trader at Vitol. But he added that he had seen a lot of demand
for the new contract.
'There is a requirement for a safe and secure hedging vehicle which we
believe New York is not providing right now,' he said.
