THE UK subsidiary of Ciba-Geigy, the Swiss chemicals and drugs group, has
reported its environmental emissions for the first time.
The figures, for 1991, show a marked increase in the level of waste the
company incinerates, but a fall in the amount sent for landfill. Ciba-Geigy
believes incineration is more environmentally friendly.
The company refused to provide details of production levels or how much it
had spent on environmental protection.
Ciba-Geigy estimates it used 12.8m tonnes of water in 1991, compared with
14.3m tonnes in 1990. Emissions of halogenated organic compounds, containing
fluorine, chlorine, bromine and iodine, fell from 200 tonnes to 168 tonnes.
Ciba-Geigy says those are a priority.
Inorganic aqueous effluent fell from 39,000 tonnes to 34,026 tonnes, while
emissions of ammoniacal nitrogen fell from 1,545 tonnes to 1,375 tonnes.
Emissions to the air dropped overall, although the level of non-halogenated
organic materials increased from 1,618 tonnes to 1,693 tonnes. Halogenated
organics fell 16 per cent from 455 tonnes to 384 tonnes, while sulphur
dioxide, implicated in acid rain, fell 28 per cent from 1,792 tonnes to
1,305 tonnes. Nitrogen oxides fell 40 per cent from 692 tonnes to 416
tonnes.
A comparison of carbon dioxide emissions - thought to create the greenhouse
effect - was not possible, although the company admitted producing 211,000
tonnes in 1991.
Special waste production fell from 20,475 tonnes to 19,314 tonnes. Waste
incinerated at high temperature increased 47 per cent from 6,437 to 9,483
tonnes, that sent for landfill fell 22 per cent from 36,176 tonnes to 28,382
tonnes.
