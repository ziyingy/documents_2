Prime minister John Major is proposing a United Nations Security Council
summit so that the council's five permanent members can discuss the security

The initiative, disclosed as Britain takes over the presidency of the
Security Council, would allow council members to discuss the issue of
control over the former Soviet Union's nuclear arsenal. Page 10; Nuclear
