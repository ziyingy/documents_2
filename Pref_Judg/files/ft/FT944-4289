Philip Morris, the US-based cigarette, food and brewing group, yesterday
claimed a partial victory in its battle with the Australian government over
the nation's anti-smoking laws, after the goverment filed amendments to the
1992 act in parliament. Morris had argued that restrictions imposed by the
1992 law, which in effect banned cigarette advertising, were so draconian
that the company was denied the right to take part in debate on political,
public and social issues, and 'normal' commercial freedom of speech.
