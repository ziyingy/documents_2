MOWLEM BUILDING has been awarded a Pounds 46.1m contract by Land Securities
for a seven-storey block at 33 Grosvenor Place, Belgravia, London.
Construction work started last month on the contract following the
completion of a six-month enabling works contract also carried out by
Mowlem. The enabling works involved the demolition of the 1950s building and
maintaining the five-storey facade.
The main contract is for a 300,000 sq ft steel-framed building. Steelwork
erection has started and is connected onto brackets that have been welded to
the facade during the demolition contract.
A central feature of the design of the building is the bank of six scenic
lifts within the main atrium. The external windows are triple glazed and the
building is fully air conditioned. Completion of the project is scheduled
for August 1992.
The entire building has been pre-let to Amerada Hess. This will become the
company's European headquarters when it moves in before the end of 1992.
