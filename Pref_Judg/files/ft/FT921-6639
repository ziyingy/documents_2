ON ROLLING plains about 50 miles to the north of Santo Domingo, the
Dominican capital, almost 7,000 acres of land previously under sugar cane
have been taken up by seemingly unending rows of pineapple plants. To the
east of the capital, in the sugar town of La Romana, a new meat processing
plant is expanding capacity to meet growing demand in foreign markets.
These ventures are part of the cutting edge of a dramatic change in
agriculture in the Dominican Republic.
Up to 10 years ago the agriculture sector was dominated by traditional crops
such as sugar (which for long was the backbone of the economy), coffee,
cocoa and tobacco. Now non-traditional crops are getting more attention from
local farmers, the government and foreign investors.
The sugar, coffee, cocoa and tobacco sectors have performed miserably in the
past decade, due to a combination of domestic and foreign market
developments. There has been a concurrent expansion of the non-traditional
sector, with investments in new crops reaching Dollars 350m over the past
eight years, and earnings from exports rising to Dollars 430m in 1988, and
expected to reach just over Dollars 600m this year.
The Joint Agribusiness Co-investment Council, which promotes the development
of non-traditional agriculture, says the expansion is reflected particularly
in the production of pineapples, citrus, melons, mangoes, vegetables, cut
flowers and ornamental plants.
The expansion has also been encouraged by a mixture of government incentives
and market opportunities. One significant development has been the Caribbean
Basin Initiative, a US trade prog- ramme which allows countries designated
by Washington to ship a range of products, also selected by the US govern-
ment, duty-free to the US market.
More recently, the Dominican Republic became a beneficiary of the Lome
Convention which allows preferential access to the European Community.
Already the country is increasing its exports of non-traditional
agricultural products to Europe. Pineapples, citrus and juice concentrate
are among the products making use of preferential access to both the
Caribbean Basin Initiative and the Lome Convention.'
Dole Dominicana produces about 2.5m (40lb) boxes of pineapples a year, and
800,000 gallons of juice concentrate. The company plans to invest another
Dollars 1m to expand the facility, which already gives the Dominican
government about Dollars 1.5m in rental fees and sales.
Agrocarne, a Dollars 16m joint venture between local investors and Campo
Frio of Spain, was drawn to the Dominican Republic for much the same
reasons, according to Mr Luis Rodriguez, the company's export manager. 'We
could have gone to other places, but labour here is cheaper and the
location, in relation to the markets we want to access, is very good.'
The company's processed pork products are currently exported to Mexico and
some Caribbean islands. Agrocarne also supplies part of domestic demand. It
is now awaiting the conclusion of negotiations between the Dominican
Republic and the US on the conditions under which Dominican pork products
can enter the American market.
Even the non-traditional agriculture sector has not been immune to problems
which have troubled the Dominican economy over the past decade. Those which
have proved most worrisome include the lack of chemicals to fight pests,
restrictions on products (such as some varieties of vegetables and fruit)
entering the US market, and outdated practices in farm management,
post-harvest handling and packaging and marketing.
Mr Fleming says that there need to be changes to some 'old bad habits and
attitudes' in the Dominican Republic, if the agriculture sector is to
continue expanding. 'The Dominican Republic is operating against the clock
in the face of changes which will be created by the widening of the North
American Free Trade Area and the possibility of changes in Cuba,' he
observes.
The concentration on non-traditional agriculture has diverted attention from
the traditional crops. While the financially embarrassed State Sugar Council
is attempting to rationalise its operations, coffee and cocoa output
continue to be victims of outdated husbandry.
Peasant farmers who should have profited from land reform with the break-up
of large plantations owned by Pres- ident Rafael Trujillo have found
themselves unable to get farm credit because they have received only
provisional titles which bankers find to be unsatisfactory collateral.
Coffee and cocoa output has fluctuated over the past decade, and although
still important foreign currency earners, both crops have been affected by
the uncertainties of a volatile market. The expansion in the output of
non-traditional products has helped to stem a decline in the agriculture
sector, which accounts for 15 per cent of the gross domestic product.
One promising area is tobacco. Exports of cigars have been increasing as the
Dominican Republic makes use of new market opportunities. 'The Dominican
Republic exports between 58m and 60m cigars each year, with the major market
being the US, which accounts for about 80 per cent of the product,' says Mr
Jose Seijas, general manager of Tabacalera de Garcia, one of the country's
leading cigar manufacturers. 'Between 10 and 15 per cent of the country's
cigar exports now go to the European Community.'
