THE dusty care-worn villagers wait expectantly. They have travelled to
Mirzapur, the sprawling north Indian city which is the centre of the
country's carpet industry, hoping for a miracle. The man they have come so
far to see smiles reassuringly and says: 'We'll get your children back.' He
picks up the telephone and so begins a desperate effort to rescue the men's
sons from illegal bonded labour.
The villagers have travelled by bus for days from their poverty-stricken
farms. All are illiterate Untouchables, members of India's lowest caste and
an easy target for exploitation. To ease their lives of abject poverty, they
have sold their sons to carpet loom owners in return for Rs500 each and
promises of well-paid work for the boys. Now, they want them back.
This tall man with the black beard is their last hope. He is Kailaish
Satyarthi, a 37-year-old former electrical engineer, who has given up his
career to become a social activist. To the horror of his family, he has also
abandoned his own caste, the priestly Brahmins, to fight for the rights of
Untouchables.
Satyarthi telephones Suresh Kumar Singh, the local magistrate, who is
required by law to investigate violations of India's child labour
legislation. But he is unobtainable, said by officials to be 'too busy' to
answer the call. After a fruitless six-hour wait, Satyarthi, accompanied by
fellow campaigners against child servitude and a number of journalists,
storms Singh's office - only to find it empty.
They wait in vain for a further hour, sitting on chairs before a large desk
on which is written the motto: 'Good public relations is the best policy'.
Eventually, a message comes, proposing a 7pm meeting at Singh's house.
Armed guards meet the group at the magistrate's colonial-style mansion. They
lead the way inside where a smiling Singh apologises to Satyarthi for the
delay - and promptly suggests postponing the meeting to the next day. Barely
able to control himself, Satyarthi refuses. He insists that Singh or one his
subordinates accompanies the group to rescue the children. 'It's your duty,'
he argues.
Singh asks for the location of the two villages where the children are
believed to be held and promises, in the best bureaucratic tradition, to see
what he can do.
CHILD labour is banned in India in many industries, including carpet
weaving. Bonded labour, where the workers' freedom of movement is
restricted, is illegal for employees of any age.
But India lacks the resources to properly police laws on child labour, as on
many other social evils. The authorities are often loathe to upset
businessmen such as the loom owners of Mirzapur who make a profitable living
employing children to produce hand-knotted carpets for the showrooms of
London, Berlin and New York.
Still less does the country have the means to quickly eradicate the economic
pressures which force parents to sell their children into bondage, not just
in the carpet industry but also in metalwork, quarrying and the manufacture
of fireworks.
Moreover, even though caste equality is enshrined in the Indian
constitution, caste consciousness makes many Indians insensitive to
exploitation of Untouchables.
Slavery is an emotive term, child slavery particularly so. But it is
difficult to see the bonded child labourers of Mirzapur as anything other
than child slaves. The words are repugnant to carpet manufacturers and to
officials of the textiles ministry.
However, as early as 1984, a local government official in Uttar Pradesh
province, which includes Mirzapur, admitted the truth in a note for a
visiting labour ministry delegation. He wrote: 'The apprentices and wage
earners. . . often work in conditions of semi-slavery.'
Ignorance, greed and corruption ensure that the law is widely flouted in
rural India. A Supreme Court Commission estimates that 75,000 children work
in the carpet industry alone - most of them bonded workers. Anti-child
labour campaigners put the figure at 300,000. Carpet industry employers
maintain such figures are 'lies' and insist there is no bonded child labour
in the industry. The events of Satyarthi's rescue raid, which I witnessed,
suggest otherwise.
The mission begins the morning after our tense meeting with the magistrate.
Somewhat to our surprise, Singh has been as good as his word and arranged
for a junior magistrate and four policemen armed with ancient ex-army rifles
to travel with us. (It later emerges that Singh also found time to warn
carpet industry bosses about the raids, as Satyarthi had feared.)
One father, Paltan Ram, said he sold his eight-years-old son Madan Lal to a
loom owner for Rs500. Only later did he realise he, along with other
parents, were losing their children for good.
To their horror, they discovered loom owners banned home visits and,
sometimes, contact of any kind. Paltan Ram says when he tried to visit his
son, he was driven away by a man armed with a shotgun. He and the others
arrived in Mirzapur after hearing about Satyarthi's campaign from his
co-workers, volunteers who travel to remote villages to collect information
and contact parents who want to recover their children. (Although the
families did not say, another spur may be the government grants of Rs6,250
for the families of rescued bonded labourers.)
Satyarthi tries to reassure the fathers as they stand in silence waiting for
the rescue to begin. The junior magistrate seems distinctly unhappy about
his assignment. Perhaps he is afraid there might be violence - as there was
on previous rescue raids. Perhaps he does not relish the idea of challenging
the carpet industry bosses, a power in the land in Mirzapur.
We drive out of the city in a dusty convoy of battered vehicles. Along the
roadside stand the weavers' workshops, mostly huts housing a weaver and his
family and one or two wooden looms. Every so often, there are large
factories and warehouses - the premises of exporters who dominate the
industry. They take orders from overseas buyers and then parcel out work to
the loom owners, who in turn employ the weavers.
As we reach deeper into the countryside, the road deteriorates into a sandy
track. The cars swerve constantly to avoid children, animals and the
occasional bullock cart. The boys' fathers sit in silence, their faces drawn
and fingers clenched. Satyarthi says he is worried that the delays may have
given the loom owners a chance to learn about the planned raids.
As we near the first of the two chosen villages, the vehicles slow down and
stop. We jump out and run through a maize field to some mud-brick huts
surrounded by trees. Satyarthi heads straight for a large hut with a loom
outside it, and discovers three boys cowering inside.
Satyarthi rushes outside. 'There must be more. Search everywhere,' he shouts
to his fellow campaigners. The activists fan out across the village and into
the surrounding fields. They find three more boys. Six altogether. Satyarthi
is disappointed - he had expected eight. The loom owner is also missing.
Satyarthi urges the group back into the cars - it is essential to reach the
second village before word about the first raid spreads. Already about 50
villagers are milling around us. As before, we drive as close as possible to
the village, and then rush in on foot. Satyarthi sprints into a courtyard
where the looms are housed behind walls studded with broken glass. But it is
too late. The boys he expected to find are gone.
Paltan Ram, Madan Lal's father, is distraught. 'I want to die,' he says,
tears welling up in his tired, blood-shot eyes.
But all is not lost. Searching through one of the village huts, Satyarthi's
co-workers find the loom owner, Govind Singh. They drag him before the
junior magistrate, demanding action. 'What are you waiting for? The parents
are here. The loom owner is here. You have the power to hold a summary
trial,' shouts Satyarthi. He pulls out a file containing the details of
child labour legislation. 'The maximum penalty is three years' jail,' he
says, glaring at the loom owner.
The junior magistrate now seems more uncomfortable than ever. As he sits
wondering what to do, the loom owner's servants come out with water and
biscuits and beds for the visitors to sit on. Satyarthi takes written
statements from the fathers, including lines expressing their fears that the
loom owner might kill their children. He threatens the loom owner, saying he
would be charged with kidnapping unless he produced the boys.
For more than an hour, we sit in the sun as the junior magistrate, the loom
owner and Satyarthi talk and shout at each other. Eventually, the loom owner
caves in and promises to surrender the children. He leaves, accompanied by
the junior magistrate. Another 30 minutes' wait. Finally, the junior
magistrate and the loom owner return, bringing with them three boys. Shyly,
they take their fathers' hands, barely understanding what is going on. Among
them is Madan Lal.
Paltan Ram hugs his son saying: 'I feel so good.' Madan Lal allows Satyarthi
to examine him. His arms are covered with scars from scabies, caused by a
common allergy to wool. On one finger he has a cut, black with diesel oil,
which the loom owner applied to the wound to stop the blood from staining
the carpets.
The junior magistrate reluctantly arrests Govind Singh, the loom owner.
Satyarthi is triumphant. The rescued boys and their fathers walk quietly
back to the cars, overwhelmed by what has happened.
Back in Mirzapur, the boys are registered by clerks at the district
magistrate's office. Madan Lal is the youngest. The oldest is 15 and has
spent five years at the loom. All look thin, and several have signs of
scabies.
For the most part, the boys have few complaints about their food, which
consisted of thin soups, vegetables and bread. But in almost every other way
they were abused. They worked 12 hours a day from 6am to 6pm, with three
half-hour breaks for meals - seven days a week, every week of the year.
They were rarely allowed out of the huts in which they worked and slept. One
says: 'Even when I went to relieve myself (in the fields), someone went with
me.'
They were never paid. If they worked slowly, they were beaten, sometimes
with a wooden stick. Worst of all was the common treatment for cuts to the
fingers suffered during weaving. The loom owners would scrape the powder off
a match on to the wound and then set fire to it to staunch the bleeding. 'It
hurt very much,' says 12-year-old Chilatra Choudhray.
Above all, the children suffered acute psychological distress. Madan Lal's
only thought was for his mother. 'I always missed my mother. I always cried
for my mother but there was nobody there to listen.'
Satyarthi says that since the early 1980s, he has helped in the release of
5,000 children, almost all of them Untouchables. He has won financial
support from western charities such as Britain's Christian Aid and Bread for
the World, a German group.
The employers, he says, only started to take notice when he began
publicising the raids - which is why he invites journalists along.
Now he is trying to generate interest in the plight of Indian child
labourers in Europe and the US - where the bulk of Mirzapur's carpets are
sold. He believes that if western consumers can be taught to take notice of
the fate of whales, they can also be made aware of the sufferings of child
labourers.
Carpet industry leaders loathe Satyarthi. Despite the evidence, including
the Supreme Court Commission's survey, they flatly deny the existence of
large-scale bonded labour. 'There may be isolated cases in remote villages,
but no more,' says Mr Prakash Chandra Jaiswal, president of the All India
Carpet Manufacturers Association, and a prominent exporter.
Jaiswal claims that allegations of parents selling children to loom owners
stem from a misunderstanding. In such transactions, loom owners have merely
made loans to the parents - advances on the wages the children will earn.
Moreover, such cases concern a small minority of children. Most child
labourers work in the homes of their parents or relatives where they learn a
valuable trade.
Nevertheless, Jaiswal and his fellow employers are worried enough to have
planned counter-measures. With the support of the textiles ministry, they
intend to begin to inspect looms. Any weaver found employing non-family
children will be blacklisted.
A breakaway group of carpet manufacturers is even introducing early next
year a special trademark certifying carpets as 'made with child-free
labour'. However, Satyarthi does not trust the employers. He argues checks
will be worthless unless they are carried out with the co-operation of
campaign groups.
India has been particularly slow in ensuring that children attend school.
Elsewhere, education has proved a valuable way of teaching parents that
their children are worth nurturing, if for no other reason that their
ultimate earnings will be higher with education than without.
Myron Wiener, an American social scientist and author of The Child and the
State in India, says just 38 per cent of Indian children complete five years
of education, compared with 70 per cent in China. Wiener argues that it is
not poverty which prevents India investing more in its children but caste
prejudices.
Upper caste Indians, who dominate central and local administration, simply
do not care enough about the children of the lower castes. Satyarthi agrees:
'I hate caste. After I started eating with Untouchables, my own family
refused to eat with me. But I chose what I wanted to do. It is the
Untouchables who suffer the most.'
