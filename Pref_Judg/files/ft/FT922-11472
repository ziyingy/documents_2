Cosmology is in a ferment this weekend, as scientists study the first
pictures ever received of the young universe, expanding out of the Big Bang
which created everything about 15bn years ago.
The observations, made from space by a US satellite, show gigantic ripples
of matter forming from the original cosmic fireball. These are by far the
earliest signs of the 'lumpiness' of the universe, which gravity was later
to pull together into galaxies, stars, planets and the objects familiar from
life on earth.
The significance of the discovery, announced on Thursday, may not match some
of yesterday's fevered newspaper headlines, which suggested that the 'riddle
of the universe' was now solved. Even so, it is the most important event in
cosmology since 1964, when scientists detected microwave radiation coming
uniformly from all parts of the sky - a faint after-glow left over from the
Big Bang itself.
That evidence convinced most cosmologists that the Big Bang theory of the
universe was broadly correct and discredited the rival Steady State theory.
But it left several mysteries. How could everything become so evenly mixed
in the instant following the Big Bang? And how could this evenly distributed
matter then clump together?
This week's discovery - the result of 300m observations made over the course
of a year by Nasa's Cosmic Background Explorer satellite (Cobe) - will help
cosmologists to resolve these mysteries.
Cobe has found variations in the cosmic background radiation which had
previously seemed to come so evenly from all directions. Analysis by
computer proves that these are genuine fluctuations in the after-glow from
the Big Bang, rather than distortions caused by radiation from astronomical
objects.
The variations represent huge ripples of matter, stretching across billions
of light-years of space and dating back about 15bn years to when the
universe was just 300,000 years old. At that time all matter was as hot as
the sun today.
The most powerful telescopes have already shown objects such as quasars and
galaxies so far away that their radiation set out when the universe was 1bn
years old or less than 10 per cent of its present age. Cobe has in effect
taken a huge leap back in time to a universe 0.002 per cent of its present
age.
It may be impossible ever to 'see' further into the past than that; when the
universe was less than 300,000 years old it was too dense to allow radiation
to escape. But scientists will use Cobe's observations - which will become
sharper as the satellite spends more time in orbit - to extrapolate back to
within a tiny fraction of a second of the Big Bang.
Nasa scientists say the first fuzzy pictures from Cobe agree with a version
of the Big Bang theory known as 'inflationary cosmology'. It postulates that
the universe had a burst of unbelievably rapid expansion - faster even than
the speed of light  - during a period lasting less than one trillionth of a
second, immediately after its creation.
All the fundamental particles and forces we know today originated during
this inflationary micro-period. At the same time, minute fluctuations in the
density of matter arose, leading to the cosmic ripples seen by Cobe and
eventually the uneven universe in which we live.
The Cobe observations also support the widely held theory that the familiar
objects seen by astronomers - galaxies, stars, planets, quasars,
interstellar dust clouds and so on - make up less than 10 per cent and
perhaps as little as 1 per cent of all material in the universe today. This
is because the amount of gravity provided by the visible fluctuations is not
nearly enough to pull together galaxies and clusters of galaxies.
The remainder of the universe consists of mysterious 'dark matter'. Mr
Edward Wright, a Cobe scientist from the University of California, said this
'must be a new kind of matter, not yet detected. We need such invisible
matter to explain how galaxies formed in the early universe and gathered
themselves together into huge clusters. Ordinary matter would be attracted
into regions of concentrated dark matter and the universe as we know it
today could develop.'
Particle physicists have proposed a long list of exotic particles left over
from the Big Bang, as possible candidates to make up the dark matter. They
include heavy neutrinos, Higgsinos, gravitinos, axions, photinos and wimps
(weakly interacting massive particles).
The Cobe observations tell us nothing directly about the identity of dark
matter. But they give a basis for calculating how much dark matter there is
in the universe. That is the vital issue for the future of the universe.
Is there enough matter for gravity to stop the universe expanding and to
draw everything together again in a Big Crunch tens of billions of years
from now? Or will the universe continue flying apart for ever, as the stars
gradually burn out and everything spreads out into an infinite coldness?
The first reaction of some scientists to the Cobe results was that they
supported the idea of a 'closed universe' which would pull itself back
together. Others continued to support the 'open universe' theory. Professor
Martin Rees, director of Cambridge University's Institute of Astronomy, said
tentatively that they were consistent with a 'flat universe' precisely
balanced between being open and closed.
What is needed now to solve the riddle of the universe is more precise
observations from Cobe, backed up by ground-based instruments which Prof
Rees said would soon be able to detect irregularities in the background
radiation.
It is reasonable to expect that, by the end of the century, there will be a
scientific consensus about the ultimate fate of the universe. That may be of
no practical use to anyone, but it is bound to have a cultural and social
impact on humanity, knowing whether our ultimate future is in another cosmic
fireball or cold nothingness.
