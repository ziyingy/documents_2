Labour yesterday launched a campaign to keep the Post Office in the public
sector with a petition against privatisation.
It published a document, called A Modern Post Office, calling on the
government to give the Post Office greater commercial freedom in the public
sector.
Mr Robin Cook, Labour's trade and industry spokesman, dismissed suggestions
that his plan would create unfair competition.
He also advocated the establishment of an independent regulator to monitor
the activities of the Post Office.
