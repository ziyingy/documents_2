The Commission for Racial Equality expressed anxiety yesterday at what it
regards as the lack of effectiveness of industrial tribunals in dealing with
racial discrimination cases.
Two out of every three complaints about racial discrimination were
employment-related last year, it revealed in its annual report. 'The
approach some tribunals take towards applicants alleging racial
discrimination - and the quality of some tribunal decisions - gives us cause
for concern,' said the commission.
'In recent years, cases of racial discrimination taken to the Employment
Appeals Tribunal have met with little success,' it added. 'There was a
worrying number of cases where the industrial tribunal found discrimination,
but this was then overturned at the EAT - in some cases because the tribunal
had issued a defective written decision.'
Half the appeals by employers made to the appeals tribunal were upheld last
year. In 1993 there were 1,630 applications to the commission for assistance
over discrimination cases - 1,160 of them in the employment field. Only 236
cases reached settlement last year - with 100 of those winning their case
after a full hearing.
The average level of settlements over racial discrimination cases fell to
Pounds 3,115 last year from Pounds 3,165 in 1992. From next Monday the legal
Pounds 11,000 ceiling is to be removed enabling tribunals and courts to
award whatever sum they believe appropriate in each case.
Yesterday the commission launched an advertising campaign with the public
relations firm Saatchi and Saatchi under the slogan: 'Uniting Britain For a
Just Society.' Mr Michael Howard, the home secretary, said that the
government was fully behind the campaign.
