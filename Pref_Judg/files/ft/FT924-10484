COLUMBIA'S astronauts yesterday hoisted a domino-like aluminium panel on the
US space shuttle's mechanical arm, then rolled and waved the panel to test
an experimental robotic vision system, AP reports from Houston.
Crew member Charles Lacy Veach grabbed the 4ft-by-8ft (1.2metre-by 2.4metre)
target panel with Columbia's 50ft (15-metre) crane and lifted it above the
payload bay. He slowly manipulated the target, turning it, pulling it from
side to side and moving it up and down, relying on the Canadian space vision
system of computers and TV cameras to operate the crane.
Canadian astronaut Steven MacLean aligned the system by targeting sets of
white dots on the black panel. The vision device seemed to work well, but it
took the astronauts two hours longer than planned to latch the panel back in
the cargo bay because of a minor problem with the jointed mechanical arm.
Ms Barbara Schwartz, spokeswoman for the US space agency Nasa, said the
delay was not expected to affect further tests planned with the machine
vision system over the next two days.
Researchers hope the computerised eye will give them more precise control of
the shuttle arm, which may someday be used to build the space station.
