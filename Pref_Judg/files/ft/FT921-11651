MR David Nellist, the Coventry South East MP expelled from the Labour party
last month for alleged links to the Trotsykite Militant Tendency, last night
said he would fight the seat as an independent.
He told supporters in his constituency that yesterday's decision by Labour's
national executive committee to start the candidate selection process had
left him with no option.
Earlier, Mr Terry Fields, Labour MP for Liverpool Broad Green, who was
expelled with Mr Nellist last month, confirmed he would also stand as an
independent.
At the 1987 election, Mr Nellist had a majority of 6,653 and Mr Fields one
of 6,047.

IRAQI SUPERGUN: British customs was not told of the Iraqi supergun project
until April 1990, one day before it seized eight metal pipes destined for
Iraq at Teesport, MPs heard yesterday.
Mr Alexander Russell, a customs commissioner, told the Commons trade and
industry committee that it would have been 'desirable' for information to be
given to his department earlier.
Government departments including the Ministry of Defence, the Foreign Office
and the Department of Trade and Industry are known to have been aware of the
Iraqi project the previous autumn.
