MR PADDY ASHDOWN, Liberal Democrat leader, confirmed last night that he
would want a seat in the cabinet and other ministerial posts for his MPs if
he supported either Labour or the Tories in a hung parliament.
Speaking on BBC television, Mr Ashdown signalled his determination to push
for the best terms possible if he held the balance of power. Liberal
Democrats would be almost certain to vote down a Queen's Speech on the
incoming government's legislative programme if it did not contain a bill to
introduce proportional representation.
Mr Ashdown said the effects would be 'devasting' if either the Conservatives
or Labour 'inflict on Britain a minority government, which will provide
another lame duck government'.
His aim would be to create a stable government. He added: 'You can't have
partnership government unless you are in that government, operating as a
member of it at all levels from the bottom to the top.'
