Small is beautiful: this saying has been a useful rule of thumb for property
funds. Over the past 10 years, property funds have produced better returns
and proved less volatile than larger rival funds, writes Vanessa Houlder.
A report by Gerald Eve and Schroder Properties found that the
best-performing property funds managed property investments of less than
Pounds 50m in total, while returns from larger funds tended to diminish in
line with their size.
This is attributable, in part, to the small funds' greater agility. On
average, smaller portfolios were successful in shifting out of retail
property, which outperformed in the early 1980s, and into industrial
property, which outperformed in the late 1980s.
Smaller funds have tended to be no more volatile than larger funds probably
because they concentrate on smaller properties; this makes it easier for
small funds to diversify a portfolio. Funds with less than Pounds 15m of
property are, however, at a disadvantage because of the smaller numbers of
properties held.
But how much of the smaller funds' outperformance is simply a matter of
luck? Small funds' inability to buy large properties, such as shopping
centres, means they have avoided some of the worst performing sectors in
recent years. 'Smaller funds have benefited by default rather than through a
conscious decision to buy small investments such as shops and industrial
units,' says the report.
However, the tide may shift towards larger property owners. 'The market has
suited smaller investors over the past five years, but the next 10 years are
sure to be different and the bias may well suit the larger investors,' the
report adds.
