Brazil has awarded a Dollars 600m (Pounds 389m) contract to US and French
consortiums for a satellite and radar system to monitor the Amazon jungle,
AP reports from Brasilia.
Two consortiums, led by Raytheon of the US and Thompson-Alcatel of France,
will build a network of radar, satellite, sensor, data-processing and
communications systems over a six-year period to monitor the 2m square mile
expanse of tropical forest.
The selection of Raytheon and Thompson-Alcatel will be announced officially
at the end of the month. The equipment will be paid for over 20 years.
