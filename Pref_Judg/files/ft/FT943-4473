US hurricane futures, European flood options and even 'Acts of God bonds'
will be traded by international investors within the next few years,
predicts Mr Richard Sandor, a US financier and a founding father of the
financial derivatives industry.
Mr Sandor, who pioneered interest rate and currency futures and options in
the 1970s and 1980s, says that an embryonic reinsurance derivatives market
is established.
Catastrophe reinsurance futures and options contracts were launched in
December 1992 by the Chicago Board of Trade, which also lists a number of
financial and other derivatives contracts. Trade so far has been limited,
but the volume of transactions has increased by more than 10 times in the
past year or so.
More important, the development of an exchange-traded product appears to be
directly influencing developments in reinsurance, where an over-the-counter
market in catastrophe reinsurance options has emerged.
'It is past its infancy and is really starting to crawl,' says Mr Sandor,
now chief executive and chairman of Centre Financial Products, a New
York-based derivatives boutiques firm, which is one of more than a dozen
firms trading the contracts in Chicago.
Most reinsurers are still highly sceptical about derivatives products. One
chief executive argues that the options currently traded on the exchange are
at least one and half times more expensive than equivalent reinsurance
contracts. Critics say the liquidity in the derivatives market is likely to
remain small and that the indices on which the contracts are based are
inadequate and inferior to the traditional reinsurance products.
However, some reinsurers are more positive. Zurich Insurance, the large
Swiss company, owns a stake in Mr Sandor's company, and others, including
two UK brokers - Sedgwick and Willis Corroon - are also exploring the
potential. There is interest, too, at Lloyd's. Mr Richard Keeling, a leading
underwriter, said: 'It is interesting; we ought to be taking it seriously.'
Underpinning the interest is the conviction that the capital base of the
orthodox insurance and reinsurance industry is increasingly inadequate to
cope with the scale of catastrophic risks, a fact graphically demonstrated
by disasters in the US.
Hurricane Andrew, which tore through Florida in August 1992, was the
costliest US catastrophe with losses of more than Dollars 16bn.
This year's Northridge earthquake, which killed 60 people and damaged 44,000
California homes in January, was the industry's second costliest, with
losses amounting to more than Dollars 7bn.
The severity of the loss was more a reflection of economic growth and
demographic change over the past two decades than the power of the seismic
shock itself. The Northridge earthquake 'would have been a non-event 25
years ago,' according to Mr Sandor.
Mr Andrew Martin, managing director of Sedgwick Payne Insurance Strategy,
says that the capital and surplus of the US property and casualty industry
is estimated at Dollars 183bn, 'but many trillions of assets are insured and
the risks exposed are increasing faster than insurers' capital and
capacity'.
The Chicago Board of Trade contract is based on an index calculated by the
Insurance Services Office (ISO), a US industry body, and on the premiums
received and claims paid by more than 24 US insurance companies.
Futures contracts are priced according to moves in the ISO loss ratio. The
settlement price of each increases by Dollars 250 for each 1 per cent
upwards movement in the ratio. For example, while a loss ratio of 20 per
cent would give each contract a value of Dollars 5,000, a loss ratio of 120
per cent would make the contract worth Dollars 30,000.
Although trade in the futures contract itself has failed to take off,
investors and buyers have begun to trade options - deals giving buyers the
right but not the obligation to buy or sell at a pre-determined price.
Most of the contracts are 'call spreads', used to limit and isolate a
particular layer of risk, explains Mr Morton Lane, managing partner of Lane
Financial, a company which advises brokers trading on the exchange.
Typically, buyers pay for an option to buy a futures contract when the loss
ratio exceeds 50 per cent and sell when the ratio exceeds 70 per cent. The
arrangements in effect give protection in the same way as an excess of loss
reinsurance contract.
Over the past 18 months the CBoT has registered more than 5,000 trades on
one particular contract - covering catastrophe losses on the eastern
seaboard of the US, where there are large storm exposures. Observers also
note a growing trend for reinsurers to use the Chicago contract loss index
as an element of a specialist reinsurance policy, the loss warranty.
Claims on a loss warranty policy are triggered by two sets of losses: those
on the insurance policy of the buyer, and industry-wide claims.
Mr Lane says that the exchange has stimulated changes in the way franchise
covers are underwritten, with the trigger relating to industry-wide losses
becoming more important.
As much as 20 times more business could be traded in 'over the counter
contracts', Mr Lane estimates, with underwriters of these deals frequently
hedging their exposures by buying exchange traded contracts.
Mr Sandor compares the development to the way in which the underwriters of
OTC interest rate swaps hedged their positions by buying eurodollar or US
government bond futures in Chicago in the 1980s, helping to fuel the growth
of that market.
In spite of industry scepticism, enthusiasts stress the attractions of the
new products. For example, while the price of a traditional contract is
generally known only by broker and underwriter, derivative contracts are
transparent. And while reinsurance contracts are negotiated once a year,
derivative contracts are more flexible and can be purchased or traded at any
time.
Mr Martin says the development signals the beginning of the securitisation
of the reinsurance industry, bringing it into line with other financial
services. 'Insurance and reinsurance may be the last frontier,' he says.
