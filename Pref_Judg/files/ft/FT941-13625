A new robot installation for packing military rations is helping the French
army cut costs and could even earn it some money. The FFr60m (Pounds 6.8m)
facility is automated and can respond quickly to sharp increases in demand
at times of crisis.
This could make it attractive to other armies and aid organisations, says
Colonel Hugues Keller, head of the facility at Angers, south-west France.
With an output of 24 rations per minute, the plant easily satisfies the
army's regular annual requirement for 2m rations and could produce two or
three times as much.
Developed as part of the army's cost-cutting programme, the facility
concentrates the production of military rations on one site. Before, there
were two. Also, says Keller, 'we have seized the opportunity and installed
state-of-the-art technology which will satisfy the needs not only of today's
army but also that of the next century'.
The robots fill cardboard cartons with the 18 constituents of a soldier's
daily food allowance. The 14 possible menus include tinned cooked meals,
chocolate bars, chewing gum, packet soup, water purification tablets, dry
crackers and paper tissues.
Each package must be put in the right position in the box so it can be
closed, sealed and covered in plastic film, ready to be packed for shipment.
At the centre of the system is a line of nine small robots from Californian
manufacturer Adept, each responsible for loading two different components
into the cartons from a conveyor.
The larger, more robust items such as the tins are put into the ration
carton first. These are removed from their boxes and fed directly to the
Adept line, one layer at a time, by three large robots from ABB Robotique
France, part of the Swiss-Swedish group. The smaller items are then fed to
the Adept robots.
