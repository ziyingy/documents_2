ELF Aquitaine, the French oil and chemicals group, became the first western
company to agree an oil exploration arrangement with the Russian government
yesterday when it signed a production-sharing deal, writes Deborah
Hargreaves. The agreement covers 20,000 sq km to the east of the Volga river
between Saratov and Volgograd. Interneft, the Russian state oil exploration
company, has drilled several promising exploration wells, but the area
currently produces no oil.
Before the break-up of the Soviet Union, Elf was negotiating for exploration
rights on the Russian-Kazakhstan border. It expects to sign a deal with
Kazakhstan before the end of February.
