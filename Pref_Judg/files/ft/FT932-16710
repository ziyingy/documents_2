BRITISH Gas and YPF, Argentina's state-owned oil company, are negotiating
the possibility of jointly exploring and developing offshore gas and
oilfields bordering the Falkland islands' territorial waters.
A British Gas executive yesterday confirmed that 'we have been discussing
with YPF a number of possible joint ventures. There is an offering in the
South Atlantic and we have discussed the possibility of joining up with YPF,
but there is nothing formal yet.'
The government plans to sell rights to six blocks in Argentine waters
adjacent to Falkland waters. A tender was scheduled for last Wednesday, but
YPF requested it be postponed for 90 days after British Gas had asked for
more time to analyse technical data.
A government official said no other companies were interested in the region
because of the dispute with Britain over the Falkland islands. None the
less, two companies are carrying out seismic exploration surveys off the
Falklands under licences issued by the islands.
Buenos Aires is anxious to increase British trade and investment, which it
hopes would allay the Falklands' suspicion of Argentina and create
commercial ties with Britain that would offset the vociferous pro-Falkland
lobby in London.
British Gas already produces oil in Argentina and last December bought a 29
per cent share in the privatised Buenos Aires gas distribution company.
UK plans to invite Argentine ministers to Britain later this year have been
welcomed in Buenos Aires.
