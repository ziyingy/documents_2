GERMAN border police said yesterday that crime was soaring on the country's
eastern frontiers as illegal immigrants, car thieves and drug smugglers
exploited the lack of border controls, Reuter reports from Dresden.
German border police caught 17,800 people trying to cross from Poland and
Czechoslovakia in the first six months of this year compared with 16,319 for
the whole of 1991. 'The number coming across has risen dramatically. It's
doubled or even trebled,' said Mr Fredi Hitz, a senior officer in Germany's
paramilitary border police.
Gangs smuggling in east Europeans were asking for up to Dollars 1,000 to
take Romanians across the border. Car thieves have stolen some 80,000
vehicles from Germany and taken them into Poland and Czechoslovakia.
