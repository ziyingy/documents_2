Georgian authorities said yesterday they had arrested a man accused of
shooting US diplomat Fred Woodruff earlier this month, but described the
envoy's death as a 'chance killing', Reuter reports from Tbilisi.
Mr Woodruff, reported to be working for the CIA, was killed while travelling
in a car with Georgian leader Eduard Shevardnadze's security chief.
A government official said the suspect had apparently fired in an attempt to
stop the car, but had not intended to kill anyone.
