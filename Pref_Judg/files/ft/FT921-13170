PEUGEOT of France forecasts a European market of 200,000 electric cars a
year by the end of the decade and is committing at least 'several hundred
million' francs to take a 25 per cent share of it.
Mr Jean Yves Helmer, Peugeot Citroen car division director, said yesterday
such a market could be achieved without Californian-style legislation
forcing makers to sell a minimum number of electric cars.
Peugeot is preparing for commercial production of electric-powered Peugeot
106 and Citroen AX models within the next three years, predicting Europe
could absorb 10,000 electric cars a year by as early as 1995. The cars are
to be built alongside 'conventional' models on existing Peugeot assembly
lines. The group has already built or taken orders for some 500 electric
Peugeot and Citroen vans.
Peugeot claims to be relatively unaffected by technical hitches which have
marked the industry's attempts to develop viable electric vehicles. It says
costs of buying and operating electric cars can compete with petrol or
diesel equivalents.
