New England moved a step closer to legalised gambling this week, with the
signing by Governor Bruce Sundlun of Rhode Island of a deal to allow the
Narragansett Indian tribe to build a Las Vegas-style casino in the state.
Last week, Governor William Weld of Massachusetts completed a similar
agreement with the Wampanoag tribe.
Gambling is currently illegal in every New England state except Connecticut.
Because the tribes are sovereign nations, they are not governed by the same
laws as US corporations. But companies might gain access to the states by
claiming unfair competition.
The Narragansetts will run the casino with Capital Gaming International, and
Rhode Island expects to earn about Dollars 53m (Pounds 34.1m) a year from
the casino. The Wampanoags intend to go into business with Carnival Hotels
and Casinos, with Massachusetts standing to receive about Dollars 105m
annually. The Narragansett and Wampanoag deals must now receive federal
approval before moving to a vote in the state legislatures.
