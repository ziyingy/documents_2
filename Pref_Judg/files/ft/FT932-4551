Mr Carlos Borrego, Portugal's environment minister, was dismissed yesterday
by Mr Anibal Cavaco Silva, the prime minister, after making a sick joke
about patients who had died under kidney dialysis treatment, Peter Wise
reports from Lisbon. At least 16 people have died as result of dialysis
treatment in a hospital in Evora in southern Portugal because aluminium
levels in the water were found to be abnormally high. The case has caused a
public outcry.
