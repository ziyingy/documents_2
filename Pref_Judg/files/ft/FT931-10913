Bad news for all of you who thought the dispute over the ownership of the
Falkland Islands had gone away. In fact it's set fair to return as a
diplomatic nightmare as we approach the millennium, thanks to that cause of
many past conflicts, oil.
A Falkland Islands' councillor, Terry Peck, has just sent an open letter to
certain British MPs complaining that the British government has failed to
provide a 'letter of comfort' to the oil industry; this would have confirmed
to the industry that a Pounds 6m oil exploration survey being conducted
around the islands would be just the first step to full exploitation.
The letter says: 'The lack of action stems from the reluctance of ministers
to face Argentina on this issue. . . . The Argentine government has already
written twice to oil companies claiming sovereignty over the areas
concerned. Britain has done nothing to counter these claims.'
Goodness knows what might happen were oil actually to be found.
