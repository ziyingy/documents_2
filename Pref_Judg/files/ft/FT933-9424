Dragon Oil, the oil and gas explorer, has joined forces with a Philippines
consortium in a Far East drilling programme.
Under the scheme, Dragon has farmed out interests in Korea and Thailand and
acquired a minimum 13.75 per cent stake in a Philippines licence.
The farm-out is with two Philippine companies, Basic Petroleum &amp; Minerals
and Palawan Oil and Gas Exploration.
