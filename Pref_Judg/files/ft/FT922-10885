London Clubs International, the casino operator, has restructured its board
as part of its attempt to retain its gaming licences. Sir Gordon Booth, a
former senior diplomat and ex-director of Hanson, joins the board as
chairman. The present chairman, Richard Hanson, remains a non-executive
director. Peter Byrne, currently managing director of the group's overseas
operations, becomes gaming director. Tom Hodgson is joining the company from
Grosvenor Clubs, a rival group, to fill the new post of compliance director.
The appointments follow the resignation last week of Max Kingsley, managing
director, and five of his senior colleagues. Their resignation was widely
seen as an attempt to secure the group's gaming licences after a raid on its
London casinos last June. London Clubs has denied any wrong-doing.
