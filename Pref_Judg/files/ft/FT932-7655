A NEW PLAN to save the ancient Oxleas Wood in south-east London was put
forward yesterday by the British Road Federation, the road user lobby group.
The plan, the latest in the long saga to preserve the 8,000-year-old wood,
proposes linking the East London River Crossing with the A2016 at Thamesmead
south of the river rather than with the A2 at Falconwood.
