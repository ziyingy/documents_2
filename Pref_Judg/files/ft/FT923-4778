Intercepted fax transmissions, obtained by fair means or foul, can seriously
compromise the wealth of a company.
But a new fax cum scrambler, the Ascom Fax 260, developed by the Integrated
Security Group based in Essex, enables compatible machines, linked by
personalised smart cards, to transmit top-secret messages between authorised
parties.
Faxes transmitted through mis-dialling or intercepted by line-tappers appear
as illegible gobbledegook on the new machine. When not in 'encryptor mode'
the machine functions as a normal fax.
The fax cum scrambler costs around Pounds 1,000 and is already being tested
by the Pentagon and the Intelligence Services in the US. British Telecom
approval for its use in the UK has just been obtained. Integrated Security
