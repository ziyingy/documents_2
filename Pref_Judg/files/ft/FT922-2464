Sir, Your leading article 'Hard questions from the BIS' (June 16), while an
admirable summary of the bank's annual report, does not convey its true
import for the issue of European Monetary Union.
This is that the BIS view of the fundamental importance of the political
dimension in achieving a single currency - notably with regard to the
commitment of the proposed central bank to monetary stability and the
enforcement of sound fiscal discipline - enhances the prospect of an inner
core European Monetary Union going ahead without Britain.
There is no question that the BIS report reflects current German thinking.
Much of the recent criticism of the Maastricht deal in the federal republic
has centred on the perceived inadequate political return Chancellor Helmut
Kohl obtained for agreeing to surrender the D-Mark. The Germans, for
example, have always been sceptical that liberalised financial markets alone
would be able to restrain member states from abusing a single currency
system through over-borrowing.
Essentially the BIS position shows how difficult it may be to convince some
continental opinion to detach European economic from political integration -
the main aim of Britain's policy ever since it joined the Community. In the
maelstrom of the ratification of the Maastricht Treaty and, even more
perhaps, if the Maastricht Treaty were to collapse, the time for hard
choices may not be long delayed.
