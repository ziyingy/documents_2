THE COMMONWEALTH of Independent States represents the 'last great frontier
for minerals exploration and development' but there are daunting challenges
facing any western company wanting to share in that development, according
to a new Financial Times Management Report.
At the same time, every mining company needs to monitor very closely changes
in the CIS's mining and economic policies so as to gauge accurately the
total impact of new mining development on international commodity markets,
says the author, Mr James Dorian.
The evidence suggests that at present much of the CIS metallurgical sector
is in crisis, he says, with 25 to 40 per cent of the ferrous metal
industry's capacity being idle, together with 40 to 65 per cent of
non-ferrous capacity.
'With little or no experience in supervising mining development activities,
the former republics are having to grapple with tremendous problems and
difficulties historically handled at a distance by Moscow authorities,' he
adds.
Nevertheless, foreign mining companies are rushing to do business in the
former Soviet Union because it possesses some of the largest reserves of
oil, gas, gold and diamonds found anywhere in the world. The Russian
Federation is by far the wealthiest of the new independent states,
accounting for about 90 per cent of CIS oil output and most of the gold,
diamonds, platinum and base metals production. As much as 40 per cent of the
world's remaining reserves of crude oil are in the Russian province of
Siberia.
After Russia, Ukraine and Kazakhstan are the next two wealthiest republics.
'The potential for further mineral discoveries in the new CIS is immense,
with the most attractive areas occurring in the Russian Federation (Far East
region and Siberia), Kazakhstan and the Caucasus region,' the report adds.
However, although the republics are welcoming foreign technology and
know-how, potential foreign investors may have to endure years of legal
wrangling as fledgling mining laws are tested and ethnic groups dispute
mineral rights.
They will also have to grapple with the local economic and technological
problems.
Other barriers to foreign entry include the CIS's lack of information on
industrial enterprises, poor infrastructure, unclear decision-making
hierarchy, non-convertible, non-existent or new, untested currencies and
conflicts over ownership rights to resources in numerous autonomous regions.
The report points out there are more than 200 ethnic groups in the new CIS
and says minerals-rich Uzbekistan 'has a high potential for inter-ethnic
unrest, as does Kyrgyzstan and, to a lesser extent, Kazakhstan. Areas of
possible conflict over mineral resource rights in Russia include the
republic of Sakha (also known as Yakutia) and the autonomous regions and
areas in western Siberia.'
