Serb and Croat media reports insisted yesterday that a formal reconciliation
between Belgrade and Zagreb was under active consideration, despite official
denials from both sides. Serbia's President Slobodan Milosevic has come
under strong pressure from western countries and his close ally, Russia, to
recognise the Croatian government and acknowledge, at least in principle,
Croatia's territorial integrity. This would mean renouncing all claims that
a separate mini-state has been created in the Serb-controlled areas of
Croatia. Mr Predrag Simic, director of Belgrade's leading foreign policy
institute, said reconciliation with Zagreb would be the 'logical next step'
in the more moderate foreign policy course charted by Mr Milosevic since his
decision in August to sever ties with Bosnian Serbs. There have been
persistent reports of a secret Serb-Croat meeting at Graz, Austria, having
taken place recently.
Meanwhile, prosecutor Richard Goldstone said yesterday in The Hague that the
Yugoslav War Crimes Tribunal would issue indictments next month. He expected
to begin trials in March. He said Croatian officials had agreed to surrender
war crime suspects but there was no indication of the identities of the
suspects, or whether they were even in custody. So far the Serbian
government has refused to co-operate with the inquiry, set up by the UN
Security Council last year.
