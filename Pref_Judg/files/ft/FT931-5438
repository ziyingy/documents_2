THE RAPID decline in estimates of sugar production in Thailand has been the
major spur behind the rally which has taken prices on the New York futures
market above 10 cents a lb, according to the latest report from ED &amp; F. Man,
the London trade house.
The fall follows dry weather earlier in the season and hints of disease. But
the report warns that some of the lower estimates - some market rumours have
suggested a fall of 1.7m tonnes to 3.5m tonnes - may be exaggerated.
According to Man's latest information, Thai sugar production up to February
28 was 4.23 per cent behind the corresponding period last year at 3.09m
tonnes. The quantity of cane crushed has fallen by 7.5 per cent to 30.13m
tonnes.
Higher yields of 102.53 kg a tonne compared with 99.03 kg last year account
for the different percentage falls. This is partly because of the
introduction of a payment system based on sugar content, which may have
encouraged farmers to delay sending cane to the mills, Man suggests.
Based on progress in previous years, the total cane crush by the middle of
this month would be only 37m tonnes, but such an early finish to the crop
seems unlikely. Man's lowest estimate for the total cane crop is now 43m
tonnes, giving 4.3m tonnes of sugar. It puts maximum possible sugar
production at 4.7m tonnes.
If Thai production were to fall below 4.3m tonnes, the world sugar market
would be pushed into a trade deficit that could support further price rises,
Man suggests. But by and large physical buyers are well covered, which
should limit the upside potential.
