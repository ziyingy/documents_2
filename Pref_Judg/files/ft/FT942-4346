Mr Michael Howard yesterday ruled out legalisation of any banned drug on the
grounds that such a move would lead to more addiction.
The home secretary told top police officers that the maintenance of
international solidarity against drug misuse was vital.
He also ruled out the de-criminalisation of drugs. To decide not to enforce
certain laws while leaving them on the statute book risked bringing 'the
whole of the criminal law into disrepute'.
His remarks to the Association of Chief Police Officers drugs conference in
Wakefield came a day after Mr Raymond Kendall, secretary-general of
Interpol, and Mr Keith Hellawell, chief constable of West Yorkshire police,
backed decriminalisation as means of tackling the drug problem.
Mr Howard said: 'To (legalise any banned drug) would be bound to increase
the human and social damage, especially that inflicted on the young.'
But he said enforcement and other 'supply-side measures' would never alone
solve the drugs problem.
Welcoming the introduction of drugs education into the national curriculum,
he said the government should help young people and other high-risk groups
to resist becoming involved with drugs.
