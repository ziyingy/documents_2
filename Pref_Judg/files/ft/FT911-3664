LUXEMBOURG yesterday proposed that the European Community establish a
fully-fledged central bank during the transition to monetary union, but
delay its creation until 1996.
The plan was tabled by the EC's current president at the regular fortnightly
meeting of special negotiators on economic and monetary union (Emu). It is
designed to strike a balance between the insistence of France and several
other states that the European central bank be set up in 1994, the planned
start of the transition to Emu, and the desire of Germany to delay such a
bank until the late-1990s target date for a single currency.
Ever since last October's Rome summit which called for a new monetary
institution in 1994, there has been a war of words between Paris and Bonn on
how to interpret that summit's communique, with Mr Jacques Delors, the
Commission president, intervening from time to time to accuse Germany of
backsliding.
The Luxembourg plan calls for a three phase move towards a fully-operational
European central bank. Six months after an Emu treaty comes into force,
perhaps 1993 or 1994 depending on the speed of ratification by national
parliaments, the present 'committee' of EC central bank governors would be
transformed into a 'council'. Its role would be to improve co-ordination of
national monetary policies, whose implementation would still be in national
hands.
By 1996, or earlier if governments agreed unanimously, the European system
of central banks would be set up, to take over the running of the European
monetary system and act as a clearing house for the Ecu.
Finally, from the date when EC governments had taken the final decision to
merge their currencies, the European central bank could expand its role to
hold and manage foreign exchange reserves. It could also start to make
policy recommendations to national central banks, and be empowered to make
those recommendations public if necessary.
