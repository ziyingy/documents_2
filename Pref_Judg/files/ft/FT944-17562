The Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development is rapidly taking
on a Marie Celeste quality, with crew deserting a captainless ship.
Some asbestos has been discovered in the Paris think-tank's main building.
Employees were given the chance to take yesterday and today off, while
experts evaluated the risk. Most shot out of the building like corks out of
Bollinger bottles: 'You should have seen the number of chain-smoking
Frenchmen haring out of here on the off-chance of a millionth part of
asbestos in the air,' said a non-French staffer.
Staffan Sohlman, Sweden's OECD envoy and acting head of the organisation,
was already a safe 400km away in Strasbourg. There he made the implausible
claim that OECD countries are deadlocked over selecting a new leader because
'they care for the organisation'.
Observer detects a parallel with the European Commission's famous cruciform
Berlaymont building in Brussels. Its closure in 1991 - also for asbestos
removal - came just before all the rows over Maastricht.
