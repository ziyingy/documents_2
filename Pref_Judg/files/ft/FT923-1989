MOST Germans, in both east and west, favour holding a referendum on the
Maastricht treaty on European union, according a comprehensive opinion poll.
Some 75 per cent in the west, and 85 per cent in the east, want a vote.
At the same time, a narrow majority is still in favour of the treaty,
although many more believe that the replacement of the D-Mark with a single
European currency would be wrong.
There is a growing feeling that the European Community brings Germany more
costs than benefits, and scepticism about the advantages of the single EC
market.
The poll found more dissatisfaction with the German government, and with the
opposition, than at any time in the past 15 years. The only reassurance for
the political establishment was that support for the extreme-right-wing
Republicans has decreased slightly since the last poll.
Support for the EC has deteriorated rapidly among German people since the
Maastricht Treaty was agreed. This is not reflected in political circles.
In east Germany - with 20 per cent of the population - 55 per cent would
vote No in a referendum, against 43 per cent saying Yes. However they are
outweighed by western voters, 47 per cent of whom would vote Yes, against 37
per cent voting No, and 16 per cent undecided. The combined result would
leave a 46-to-41 per cent majority in favour, with 13 per cent undecided.
The overwhelming cause of dissatisfaction is concern about the future of the
D-Mark: 68 per cent in the west, and 75 per cent in the east, oppose its
replacement by a single currency. Eighty per cent believe a single currency
would be less stable.
All the views spell gloom for Chancellor Helmut Kohl, who has adopted
European integration as his theme for uniting the country. He comes bottom
in the poll of politicians' popularity.
