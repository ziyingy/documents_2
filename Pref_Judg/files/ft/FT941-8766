In one of the most embarrassing computer glitches ever to hit a big retail
bank, Chemical Bank yesterday said that it had accidentally taken millions
of dollars out of thousands of its customers' checking accounts.
Any of Chemical's 1m customers in the New York city area who withdrew cash
from the bank's automated teller machines on Wednesday faced a nasty shock
yesterday. The bank's computer debited each withdrawal twice from customers'
accounts, leaving many customers in the red.
Irate customers who called the bank yesterday morning were told that
Chemical was still investigating the extent of the problem, and that efforts
were being made to re-credit the money to their accounts by the close of
business.
Cheques would not be bounced if customers' accounts had been debited by
mistake, the bank added.
The problem occurred while 'we were doing some systems modifications', the
bank said. This had led to an 'error in routing', though it did not
elaborate further. 'Tens of thousands of transactions' were affected, it
said.
A bank employee at one of Chemical's service centres said it was still
unclear how the problem had occurred, but that the bank was looking into it.
Some 900 automated teller machines, or one out of every five which dispense
cash in the metropolitan area, are owned and run by Chemical, the city's
second biggest retail banking institution after Citibank. Chemical has 1m
customers in the New York area.
The answer to one question remained unclear yesterday: if the bank's
computer was debiting money from thousands of its customers' accounts, whose
account was it crediting? 'There was no loss to customers or the bank. It
wasn't a fraud,' the bank said.
