The Conservatives are languishing 39 percentage points behind Labour in a
MORI opinion poll published in today's Times, confirming the record
39.5-point gap identified by Gallup earlier this month.
MORI puts Labour support at 61 per cent, compared with 55 per cent a month
ago. Tory support is put at 22 per cent (24), and Liberal Democrat support
at 13 per cent (17). Only 8 per cent said they were satisfied with the
government's performance.
