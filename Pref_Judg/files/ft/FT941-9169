The idea that your breakfast cereal or toast began life being fertilised
with sewage sludge may not be very appealing. But it seems this will
increasingly be the case.
Some 42 per cent of the 1.1m dry tonnes of sludge produced in the UK each
year is already applied to cereal and industrial crops and to grassland. The
quantity is expected to rise sharply in the next 12 years as European Union
regulations on effluent treatment double the amount of sludge produced.
Sludge will also need a new home when dumping at sea is banned in 1998.
UK farmers could save between Pounds 15m and Pounds 22m a year on chemical
fertilisers, and obtain similar results, by opting for sludge, says Mark
Aitken, environmental scientist at the Scottish Agricultural College.
Aitken will tell local authority and water company representatives at the
Scottish Exhibition and Conference Centre in Glasgow today that sludge
contains nitrogen and phosphorus - important plant nutrients - and organic
matter, which improves the soil's ability to hold water.
But he will emphasise the need for careful analysis since it can also
contain heavy metals and organisms that cause salmonella and other diseases.
Fields must be tested, too, for suitability for sludge application.
Sewage sludge is not used to grow fruit and vegetables in case any bacteria
splash on to the crop and are not washed off.
But it is safe for cereals because it is applied when plants are young,
before the edible ears have grown. 'The plant is also quite discriminating
and doesn't transmit any contaminants to the edible portion,' says Aitken.
The prospect of more sludge being recycled free of charge on fields is
likely to worry fertiliser manufacturers. Aitken admits it may also be
resisted by farmers preferring an inorganic fertiliser which they have used
successfully for 20 years to 'some nasty brown stuff'.
