The government's moves to amend the new Petroleum Revenue Tax (PRT) regime
was seen as good news for the smaller exploration companies by the leading
broking houses.
Mr Simon Flowers, exploration and production analyst at NatWest Securities,
said the news was 'particularly bullish for companies planning to spend up
to Pounds 10m on exploration over the next two years and which stand to pay
PRT in the near term'.
NatWest said virtually all smaller explorers will see their net asset values
boosted, and mentioned the clearest winners as Aran, Hardy and Goal. The
broker added that Lasmo and Enterprise would gain from the changes but that
their exploration budgets would be too large for the changes to be material.
Other brokers took the view that the changes were moderately positive.
Hardy Oil rose 6 to 168p, additionally helped by the results. Aran held at
33p and Goal edged up a penny to 64p.
