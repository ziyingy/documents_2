A ferry packed with Haitians bringing food and animals to sell in the
markets of the capital sank in a storm and hundreds of people were feared
dead, officials and witnesses said yesterday, Reuter reports from
Port-au-Prince.
One survivor said there were about 820 people on the boat, but other reports
put the total as high as 2,000. The freighter Neptune is one of two ferries
serving the route that links Port-au-Prince, the capital, and Jeremie, a
major agricultural production centre in southwestern Haiti.
