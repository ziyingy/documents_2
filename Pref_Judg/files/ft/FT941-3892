Dresdner Bank, Germany's second biggest bank, has set up a new research unit
to beef up its international securities markets activities.
Dresdner International Research Institute (DIRI), will provide research into
equities and fixed-income securities as well as advice on investors' asset
allocation strategies.
Mr Bernhard Walther, chief executive, says the move will help the bank
compete more effectively with research provided by Anglo-American and
Japanese securities institutions based primarily in London.
The move follows a similar step from Deutsche Bank, Germany's biggest bank,
which set up DB Research in 1992.
The aim is to provide a high degree of independence from the parent bank,
with the aim of ironing out possible conflicts of interest with buyers of
stocks and bonds.
These conflicts are accentuated by the German universal banking system,
which allows banks to provide a vast range of lending and advisory services
under one roof and trade securities on their account.
Although Mr Klaus Friedrich, Dresdner's chief executive, is managing
director of the new institute, the bank's macroeconomics research will be
not be absorbed into DIRI.
