Some 67 per cent of Americans approve of legalised gambling, according to a
survey published yesterday. Unfortunately, however, they do not live in
Missouri, where ornery southerners have voted down a constitutional
amendment to legalise all sorts of riverboat gambling.
Riverboat casinos are big business on the Mississippi. States encourage them
because of the money and jobs they bring; but paradoxically, opposition to
gambling is stronger in the traditional south than almost anywhere else in
the US.
Yesterday's referendum result will leave riverboat casino operators free to
offer games of skill, like poker and blackjack, but not slot machines where
the real money is made.
No doubt the riverboats will be slipping their moorings and floating over to
the opposite bank of the river - in the state of Illinois.
