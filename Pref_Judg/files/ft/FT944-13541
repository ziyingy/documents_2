Colin Fraser, 49, chief executive of McGregor Cory, the contract
distribution business of Ocean, has resigned, and will be leaving the group
by mutual agreement at the end of the month. Fraser was also a main board
director of Ocean, the freight, environmental and marine services group
which has continued to disappoint the City.
John Allan, who became chief executive of the group last month, said
yesterday that he would be taking a personal role in McGregor Cory as
executive chairman. Significant investments had been made in the business,
and he aimed to accelerate the rate of return to shareholders.
Fraser, whose total emoluments last year were Pounds 113,000, was on a
three-year rolling contract. Compensation is still being discussed.
Allan said there were no plans to change any other executive directors at
the moment.
