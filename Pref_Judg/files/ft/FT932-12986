THOSE who claim the Church should not be involved in politics are 'knaves or
fools', the Rev James Weatherhead, moderator-elect of the General Assembly
of the Church of Scotland, said yesterday.
Interviewed in the church's magazine Life and Work, published yesterday, he
says that it is not just the church's right but its obligation to be
involved in debate on social and public issues.
He added: 'The idea that the Church should not be involved in politics is
not sustainable in terms of the gospel as I understand it.'
