THE UN's top environment official said yesterday that damage to the ozone
layer was worse than previously thought and proposed advancing a ban on
ozone-eating chemicals by four years to the start of 1996, Reuter reports
from Geneva.
'The full consequences of our past folly will be painful,' said Dr Mostafa
Tolba, executive director of the UN Environment Programme (UNEP), at the
start of 10 days of UN negotiations to tighten the 1987 Montreal Protocol on
the ozone layer.
Most industrialised regions are so alarmed by new reports demonstrating the
rapid destruction of the protective ozone layer that they will almost
certainly approve a target of 1996 for banning the chemicals, which include
chlorofluorocarbons.
