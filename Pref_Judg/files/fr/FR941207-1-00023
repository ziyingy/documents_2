The Service has examined spotted owl protective measures throughout the species' range. The management strategies
employed by various agencies and tribes have been developed independently without a common overall approach. These
strategies provide varying levels of protection to existing owl sites, but most do not conform to an overall, landscape
recovery strategy. In addition, there has been no assessment of the adequacy of these varied approaches in promoting
range-wide conservation of the Mexican spotted owl. Thus the Service has determined that the designation of critical
habitat in areas subject to timber harvest will help to preserve options until a long-term, range-wide management
strategy is developed and its implementation ensured.

The Service appointed the Team in March 1993. Since that time the Team has assembled all available data on Mexican spotted
owl biology, the threats faced across the species' range, current protection afforded the species, etc. Using that
information, the Team developed the Draft Mexican Spotted Owl Recovery Plan. Availability of that document will
be announced in the

The Draft Mexican Spotted Owl Recovery Plan recommends a landscape management strategy that will conserve the species
as population and habitat trends are assessed. If made final, the recovery plan will guide management of this species
over the next 10&hyph;15 years. The Service will assess the value of critical habitat in implementing the recovery
plan, and that assessment may influence the final critical habitat rulemaking.

Section 7 Consultation

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Section 4(b)(8) of the Act requires, for any proposed or final regulation to designate critical habitat, a brief description
and evaluation of those activities (public or private) that may adversely modify such habitat or may be affected by
such designation. Regulations found at 50 CFR 402.02 define destruction or adverse modification of critical habitat
as a direct or indirect alteration that appreciably diminishes the value of critical habitat for both the survival
and recovery of a listed species. Such alterations include, but are not limited to, alterations adversely modifying
any of those physical or biological features that were the basis for determining the habitat to be critical. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Section 7(a)(2) requires Federal agencies to ensure that activities they authorize, fund, or carry out are not likely
to destroy or adversely modify critical habitat. This Federal responsibility accompanies, and is in addition to,
the requirement in section 7(a)(2) of the Act that Federal agencies ensure their actions do not jeopardize the continued
existence of any listed species. As required by 50 CFR 402.14, a Federal agency must consult with the Service if it determines
an action may affect a listed species or critical habitat. Thus, the requirement to consider adverse modification
of critical habitat is an incremental section 7 consideration above and beyond section 7 review to evaluate jeopardy
and incidental take of the species. Regulations implementing this interagency cooperation provision of the Act
are found at 50 CFR 402.

Conference on Current Activities

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Section 7(a)(4) of the Act and 50 CFR 402.10 of the regulations require Federal agencies to confer with the Service
on any action that is likely to result in destruction or adverse modification of proposed critical habitat. The Act
requires Federal agencies to reinitiate consultation on previously reviewed actions should conditions change
(e.g., if the Service designates critical habitat); consequently, some Federal agencies may request conference
with the Service on actions for which formal consultation has been completed. Conference reports provide conservation
recommendations to assist the agency in eliminating conflicts that may be caused by the proposed action. The conservation
recommendations in a conference report are advisory. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
If an agency requests, and the Service concurs, the Service may issue a formal conference report. Formal conference
reports on proposed critical habitat contain a biological opinion that is prepared according to 50 CFR 402.14, as
if critical habitat were designated. The Service may adopt the formal conference report as the biological opinion
when the critical habitat is designated, if no significant new information or changes in the action alter the content
of the opinion (see 50 CFR 402.10(d)).
