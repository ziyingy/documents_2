Respondents' concerns that use of the Forest plan to guide permit continuance decisions or determining alternative
public purposes reflects the lack of understanding of the planning process. The planning policy sets forth clear
direction to involve all affected parties and the public when amending or revising a Forest plan. These requirements
are emphasized in the proposed recreation residence policy which requires notification and involvement of holders
and their representatives (FSM 2721.23h, paragraph 2). The agency believes that requirements that holders be involved
in all actions affecting the recreation residence use are adequately covered in the policy and will not lead to inconsistent
or arbitrary treatment of the use during Forest planning.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Environmental analysis is the cornerstone upon which decisions by local agency officials rest. Agency policy on
environmental analysis at FSM 1950 and FSH 1909.15 is clear and detailed. Actions which affect the Forest plan, including
those which implement the plan must be supported by environmental documentation. Respondents concerns that the
recreation residence use will be adversely affected through a process that they are not informed of or involved in
must consider this policy in its entirety and recognize that long-established agency policy would not permit this
to happen.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Use of the term ``alternative public purpose'' in the proposed policy reflects the agency's recognition that the
Assistant Secretary's appeal decision required decisions on continuance to be made in a neutral manner. The holders'
desire for continued use cannot be considered superior to other public uses but must be judged in the context of the
overall use of the land. The word ``alternative'' is intended to convey the concept of equality of use instead of superiority
of one use over another. The agency recognizes that the recreation residence use must be considered equally when considering
allocation of land and resources through the Forest planning process. On the other hand, it does not, indeed, it cannot,
place the use at a higher level than other uses in the Forest planning process. It is the Forest planning process which
defines and limits alternative public uses through allocation of land and resources. Alternative public uses can
only be those which the Forest plan defines. Thus, the phrase is considered the most accurate way to portray the actions
involved in recreation residence continuance and will be retained in the final policy.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The agency rejects respondents' concerns that the term ``continue to'' in FSM 2347.03, paragraph 1, lends bias toward
renewal of the permit. The term is fully consistent with policy stating that the use is a valid use of National Forest
land. Further, it is limited by the language which follows in the provision.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The agency also rejects respondents' objections to policy promulgated at the national level which cannot adequately
address local conditions affecting the use, and, conversely, that such decisions should not be made by local officials.
The proposed policy balances national policy on recreation residence use with a planning and decision-making process
made at the individual National Forest level. This decentralized process is considered the most appropriate way
to manage these Federal lands.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Therefore, the agency will adopt the language of the proposed policy at FSM 2347.03, paragraph 3 (renumbered as paragraph
2 in the final policy), and FSM 2721.23e, paragraph 1, pertaining to continuance of the use unless the use is at a location
where an alternative public purpose has been established through the Forest planning process. Paragraph 1, FSM 2721.23e,
has been edited for clarity and consistency with the forest planning process.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
b. Use Consistent With Forest Plan. The proposed policy at FSM 2721.23e, paragraph 2, provided guidance when making
decisions on continuance of the use. It stated: ``Decisions to issue new recreation residence term permits following
expiration of the current term permit require a determination of consistency with the current Forest plan. Make this
determination by evaluating the extent to which continued recreation residence use adheres to the standards and
guidelines contained in the management prescription for the appropriate management area. Address continuation
of recreation residence use on a tract or group of tracts basis, not on individual sites.'' Subparagraph a then sets
forth direction when recreation residence use was consistent with the current Forest plan. When the use was consistent
with the plan, the use would continue, a new permit issued, and the decision to issue categorically excluded from environmental
documentation, unless ``extraordinary circumstances'' were present that would merit analysis of environmental
effects. The procedural direction in FSH 41.23a provided detailed instructions on issuing new permits when the use
was consistent with the Forest plan.

The 1991 proposed policy advised that the agency was currently revising its policies and procedures for complying
with NEPA and that the adoption of final NEPA policy could affect the direction contained in the proposed policy relating
to environmental analysis and documentation. The final NEPA policy was adopted on September 18, 1992 (57 FR 43180),
and does affect this proposed policy.

Comment.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
There were 771 comments directed to this provision that gives guidance where recreation residence use is consistent
with the Forest plan. While respondents favored the expedited process in issuing a new permit, nearly all stated some
degree of opposition to the direction. Comments focused on the requirements for environmental analysis as the basis
for a decision to continue the use, particularly the requirements relating to ``extraordinary circumstances.''
Respondents felt that recreation residences, having been in place for many years, do not cause significant environmental
effects and the decision to issue a new permit should be categorically excluded from environmental documentation.
Respondents also suggested that requiring environmental analysis was unnecessary, redundant, and costly. They
suggested that the requirement be severely limited and each decision to prepare environmental documentation be
reviewed by superior officials before being implemented.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Respondents expressed concern that extraordinary circumstances, described in the notice as including the presence
of threatened or endangered species or their critical habitat, flood plains, wetlands, archaeological sites, or
historic properties or areas, were present in nearly every recreation residence tract, and thus would always trigger
further environmental analysis even though the recreation residence has existed within such circumstances and
without causing adverse impacts. Respondents pointed out that the fact the use was consistent with the Forest plan
would be rendered meaningless because all uses would be subjected to an environmental analysis or environmental
impact statement before a new permit could be issued. They felt that this requirement was too open-ended and discretionary
and would allow generalities, such as open space, visual corridors, or general forest areas to be defined as extraordinary
circumstances. They recommended that the presence of an assumed extraordinary circumstance should not in itself
preclude continuation of the use, or create a presumption of inconsistency with the Forest plan, until analysis proves
the circumstance to be truly extraordinary and continued recreation residence use a threat to the environment. One
respondent suggested that extraordinary circumstances be limited to those which are new and did not exist in the period
shortly before the time when a decision on continuance is to be made, and that the presence of endangered species, for
example, in the area of recreation residences should not automatically trigger the preparation of an environmental
analysis or impact statement.
