The test procedures call for the separate measurement of methane using gas chromatography

 as specified in the Society of Automotive Engineers (SAE) Recommended Practice J1151. This is consistent with both
the previously established EPA procedure for light-duty vehicles and light-duty trucks (40 CFR 86.111&hyph;94
and 40 CFR 86.140&hyph;94), and the California procedure for methane measurement. This approach does not permit
continuous methane measurement of exhaust samples and will require that a bag sample be collected for all classes
of vehicles and engines. (The SAE Recommended Practice J1151 is incorporated by reference in sections 86.111&hyph;94(b)(3)(vii)
and 86.1311&hyph;94(b)(2)(iii) of the regulatory text and is available in EPA Air Docket A&hyph;92&hyph;30.)

Gas Chromatography_A separation technique in which a sample of the gaseous state is carried by a flowing gas (carrier
gas) through a tube (column) containing stationary material. The stationary material performs the separation by
means of its differential affinity for the components of the sample.

Under the approach for measuring NMHC, THC will first be measured using the FID. Then, methane will be measured using
gas chromatography. This methane measurement will then be multiplied by a ``FID response factor.'' This response
factor is necessary because the FID responds differently to methane than it does to other hydrocarbons. In order to
find what portion of the FID's THC reading is attributable to methane, the tester must know the relationship between
the FID response to other hydrocarbons and to methane. Such a ``FID response factor'' is calculated by noting the response
of the FID, calibrated for typical HCs, to a known quantity of methane. For example, if a sample known to be 10.0 grams
of methane gives a FID reading of 11.0 grams, then the FID response factor is 11.0/10.0 or 1.10. The mass of NMHC is then
the difference between the THC (as measured by the FID) and the methane (as measured by gas chromatography), multiplied
by the FID response factor.

For natural gas vehicles (NGVs), the Natural Gas Vehicle Coalition and the American Gas Association suggested that
the EPA adopt the CARB method of direct measurement of NMHC by gas chromatography. This issue was also raised in response
to the Gaseous Fuels Rule NPRM (proposed in November, 1992), and EPA has addressed all concerns related to the measurement
of NMHC emissions for NGVs in the subsequent Gaseous Fuels FRM. The NMHC measurement method promulgated in this section
is the same as the method established in the Gaseous Fuels FRM. If the NMHC measurement procedure for NGVs is revisited
and changed in the future, then any revised method will apply to clean-fuel vehicle testing as well.

In order to provide manufacturers with additional flexibility, EPA proposes to make the measurement of methane (and
subsequent calculations) optional. Manufacturers would be allowed to measure and report THC emissions for compliance
with the NMHC standards. Since THC emissions are the sum of the methane and NMHC emissions, they will be higher than
the NMHC emissions alone; thus, if the THC emissions are lower than the standard, the NMHC will also be below the standard.
While this option in effect increases the stringency of the standard, some manufacturers may find that the savings
associated with using a simpler test procedure justify certifying under this option. This is especially true for
diesels, where the methane fraction of THC emissions is small.

 and PM emissions from heavy-duty engines

. Under this program, a manufacturer can take emissions credits for producing vehicles that are below the applicable
standards, and then use those credits either on its own engines within the same averaging set or to sell to other manufacturers
for use in families in the same averaging set which do not meet the applicable standards (trading). These emission
credits can be used in the year generated or retained for later use (banking). Fleet average emissions are unchanged
by this program.

It would be inappropriate for a manufacturer to receive certification emission credits for vehicles certified under
part 88 (i.e., CFV LEVs, ULEVs and ZEVs) for participation in the fleet program. The CFV standards are mandatory for
covered fleet vehicle purchases; to also allow manufacturer credits for certification of the same vehicles would
result in less emission reduction than is contemplated in the Act. Thus, CFVs certified under part 88 for use in the
fleet program for either compliance or credit purposes shall be excluded from the manufacturers' credit exchange
program. By contrast, single-fuel engines that are certified under part 86 may not participate in the fleet program
even if their emissions meet CFV standards. Therefore, such engines may generate manufacturer certification credits.
However, dual- and flexible-fuel vehicles certified under part 86 may only be able to generate certification emission
credits based on the least stringent standard to which the vehicle is certified since the manufacturer has no control
of the fuel used by the vehicle owner.

In order to allow a distinction between engines which are eligible for the fleet program and those that are not, EPA
requires manufacturers to have different engine lables. Those engines labeled under Part 88 must include on the label
an indication that this engine is intended to be part of a clean-fuel vehicle program, and as such, they will be excluded
from the manufacturers' credit exchange programs. Those engines labeled under Part 86 only will not include any indication
on the label that the engine meets any of the emissions requirements of Part 88, and as such, they will be excluded from
all clean-fuel vehicle programs and may be included in a manufacturers' credit exchange programs. EPA will allow
manufacturers to divide a clean-fueled engine family into two engine families, one labeled under Part 88 (the Part
which regulates clean-fuel fleet vehicles) and one labeled under Part 86 (the Part which regulates conventional
vehicles) only. The Agency believes that this approach will prevent ``double counting'' of emissions benefits,
but will still provide the manufacturers flexibility in determining the most cost effective means of complying with
the requirements of Part 86.
