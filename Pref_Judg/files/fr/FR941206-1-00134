SUMMARY:
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
 EPA is proposing amendments to its rules under the Toxic Substances Control Act (TSCA) for polychlorinated biphenyls
(PCBs). Changes are being proposed for the requirements for determining PCB concentration; marking, storage, and
disposal; decontamination levels and procedures; and the reporting and recordkeeping requirements for PCBs, PCB
Items, environmental media (e.g., soil, sediments, rivers, and lakes) contaminated with PCBs or PCBs in association
with radioactive materials. In addition, EPA proposes to insert additional definitions and references, include
new authorizations and exemptions, require the registration of certain electrical transformers, regulate combustion
in industrial furnaces, regulate the disposal of liquids in landfills, coordinate PCB disposal approvals with other
Federal and State programs, and revise the reportable quantity in the spill cleanup policy. EPA is also proposing
to coordinate strategies for the remediation of PCB spills and other disposal sites, including cleanup under the
Resource Conservation and Recovery Act (RCRA) Corrective Action provisions and the Comprehensive Environmental
Response, Compensation and Liability Act (CERCLA or Superfund) remedial programs.

A. Purpose of this Proposed Rule 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
On June 10, 1991 (56 FR 26738), EPA published an Advance Notice of Proposed Rulemaking (ANPRM) to solicit comments
on possible changes to the PCB disposal regulations promulgated under the authority of TSCA section 6(e) and codified
in 40 CFR part 761. Comments and supporting data on the issues outlined in the ANPRM, a number of other topics pertaining
to the PCB regulations, and the interface between those regulations and other Federal and State programs affecting
PCBs were received from more than 90 respondents. EPA has considered all of the comments. Based on these comments,
EPA is including in this proposal changes in a number of areas of the PCB regulations that were not addressed in the ANPRM.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Several commenters submitted information concerning the toxicity of PCBs and the methods used by EPA to determine
exposure to PCBs. EPA is currently conducting a review of the toxicity and mechanisms of action associated with PCBs
and several structurally related chemicals. This review may not be complete until after the promulgation of these
amendments. Since EPA cannot predict the outcome of the toxicity review and does not want to delay the promulgation
of these rules, it is proposing flexibility in certain disposal regulations to allow for changes in EPA's position
on PCB toxicity. In a similar fashion, EPA is proposing flexibility in certain disposal regulations to allow site-specific
exposure data and changes in EPA's risk assessment methods to serve as the basis for making a determination regarding
the selection of acceptable disposal technologies for certain PCB wastes.

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
On April 6, 1990, EPA issued a proposed rule in the 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 -->
Federal Register
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 (``Polychlorinated Biphenyls; Wet Weight/Dry Weight Clarification, 55 FR 12866) to amend a portion of the PCB regulations
codified at 40 CFR 761.1(b) that addresses the analysis of PCBs on a dry weight basis. The comment period for the April
6, 1990 proposal ended on May 7, 1990. Comments on that proposal were received from 16 respondents. In today's 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 -->
Federal Register
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
, EPA is issuing a reproposal of the wet weight/dry weight rule. All comments received on the April 6, 1990 proposal
were considered in the preparation of this proposed rule, and those comments are included in the rulemaking record
for this proposed rulemaking. The comments received for the April 6, 1990 proposal and any comments received on this
proposed rule will be considered in the final rule. Today's reproposal would clarify the requirements for determining
PCB concentrations in liquids, non-liquids, and multiphasic combinations of liquids and non-liquids (see unit
III. M. of this preamble).

C. Waste Minimization and Combustion Strategy 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
On May 18, 1993, EPA announced a draft strategy to address waste minimization and combustion of hazardous waste under
RCRA. The strategy is designed to stimulate a broad national dialogue on how: 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(1) To better integrate waste minimization into EPA's hazardous waste management program. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
 (2) To determine the appropriate role of combustion in that program. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
 (3) To ensure that hazardous waste combustion standards are fully protective of human health and the environment.
The draft strategy sets forth a series of short- and long-term activities that EPA would undertake in pursuing these
three areas, among which are rulemakings to address technical standards for hazardous waste combustion and public
participation in the RCRA permitting process. The draft strategy also sets forth EPA's intention to use RCRA's case-by-case
omnibus permitting authority where necessary to protect health and the environment, and to impose upgraded permit
conditions in newly issued permits. In addition to other potential areas, these permit conditions may address emissions
of dioxins, furans, and particulate matter. Finally, the draft strategy announced EPA's intentions over the succeeding
18 months to give permitting priority to existing, operating RCRA combustion units. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The PCB program under TSCA is different from RCRA in several aspects. The manufacture of PCBs is generally banned,
and the use of PCBs is heavily restricted. Therefore, any disposal issues are limited to a finite, although widely
dispersed, universe. The PCB program mandates the burning of certain high-risk wastes. It also allows wastes, such
as low concentration liquids and drained transformer carcasses, with a lower potential risk of exposure, to be disposed
of in other types of combustion units (e.g., industrial boilers) to provide disposal capacity. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
EPA proposes to make the following adjustments in the PCB disposal program under TSCA in response to issues raised
in the combustion strategy. For fixed-site incinerators, approval conditions (for new units or at the time of renewal)
would be adjusted to reflect new standards and procedural requirements adopted under RCRA. For mobile incinerators,
approval conditions (for new units or at the time of renewal) would be adjusted to reflect new standards and procedural
requirements adopted under RCRA where applicable. Unique to the PCB disposal program under TSCA is the concept of
mobile incinerators. A single multi-year approval, that imposes the same technical standards applicable to fixed-site
incinerators, is issued to these units. State and local governments receive prior notification and can impose additional
restrictions on the mobile units using their own authorities. The TSCA approval generally limits the operating time
at any one site unless additional assessment of risk and public notice are conducted. However, EPA has not adopted
site-specific risk assessments and public participation in the permit development process for mobile incinerators
because EPA and the public would lose the considerable benefits derived from mobile disposal units considering these
units allow only minimal exposure due to their high destruction efficiency and limited operating time at each site.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The current industrial boiler rules at 40 CFR 761.60(a)(2)(iii) and 761.60(a)(3)(iii) and industrial furnace rules,
proposed at 761.60(a)(4), limit both the concentration and volume of PCBs which can be treated in these units. Industrial
boilers and furnaces are units that were built to perform other functions such as power generation or materials recycling,
with the combustion of PCBs and hazardous wastes as a secondary function. The primary function poses a separate risk
which should be considered when addressing the overall risk posed by the combustion of low concentration, low volume
PCBs in industrial boilers and furnaces. Therefore, EPA proposes to impose uniform technology-based standards,
instead of site-specific permit conditions, on industrial boilers and furnaces due to the low risk posed from the
combustion of low concentration, low volume PCBs and because these units are constructed and operated for other purposes.
EPA specifically requests comment on how best to implement the combustion strategy given the controls already imposed,
or proposed in this rulemaking on the quantities and concentrations of PCBs which can be disposed of in industrial
boilers and furnaces. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
EPA believes that the regulations that currently apply to PCBs, along with those proposed, are sufficient under TSCA
to protect the public and the environment from unreasonable risk of injury. Although EPA's May 18, 1993, draft strategy
on waste minimization and combustion of waste extends only to RCRA hazardous wastes, its overall objectives were
carefully considered in the development of this proposed rule. EPA requests comment on its overall plan for implementing
the Agency's combustion strategy for the PCB program under TSCA.

D. Coordination of Programs 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
PCBs are regulated under several statutes administered by EPA. In particular, PCBs are subject to the corrective
action provisions of RCRA. In an effort to harmonize standards for the cleanup of PCBs under both RCRA and TSCA, EPA
is today proposing cleanup programs under both statutes for comparison and comment. The Agency's goal is to harmonize
action levels for PCBs under RCRA with the target standards for approval of risk-based remediation actions under
proposed 761.61(c). (See Unit II.A.7. for the RCRA proposal.)

The TSCA portion of this proposed rule is issued pursuant to sections 6(e)(1), 6(e)(2)(B), 6(e)(3)(B) and 18(b) of
TSCA. Section 6(e)(1)(A) gives EPA the authority to promulgate rules prescribing the methods for the disposal of
PCBs (15 U.S.C. 2605(e)(1)(A)). TSCA section 6(e)(1)(B) provides broad authority for EPA to promulgate rules that
would require PCBs to be marked with clear and adequate warnings (15 U.S.C. 2605(e)(1)(B)). TSCA section 6(e)(2)(B)
gives EPA the authority to authorize the manufacture, processing, distribution in commerce, and use of PCBs in other
than a totally enclosed manner (15 U.S.C. 2605(e)(2)(B)). TSCA section 6(e)(3)(B) provides that any person may petition
EPA for an exemption from the prohibition on the manufacture, processing, and distribution in commerce of PCBs (15
U.S.C. 2605(e)(3)(B)). EPA may by rule grant an exemption if the Administrator finds that: ``(i) an unreasonable
risk of injury to health or the environment would not result, and (ii) good faith efforts have been made to develop a
chemical substance which does not present an unreasonable risk of injury to health or the environment and which may
be substituted for such polychlorinated biphenyl.'' TSCA section 18(b) gives EPA the authority to exempt, by rule,
any State from subsection (a)(2) (15 U.S.C. 2617(b)). EPA may by rule grant a State the authority to, among other things,
regulate any aspect of PCBs in use, such as requiring a notification of that use. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The RCRA portion of this rule (discussed in Unit II.A.7. of this preamble) is issued pursuant to sections 1006, 2002(a),
3004(u), 3004(v), 3005(c) and 3007 of the Solid Waste Disposal Act as amended by the Resource Conservation and Recovery
Act, as amended by the Hazardous and Solid Waste Amendments of 1984 (42 U.S.C. 6924). 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
No additions or changes are proposed at 40 CFR part 300 in this rule under CERCLA (42 U.S.C. 9601&hyph;9657).

F. Summary of Proposal 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Consistent with these authorities described in Unit I.E., EPA is proposing a number of modifications to the PCB disposal
rules to provide flexibility in addressing the disposal of PCBs where specific conditions would allow for different
waste management activities than are currently available under the regulations, while still providing protection
from unreasonable risk of injury. EPA is also proposing modifications to the disposal regulations that would allow
for the recognition of PCB waste management activities undertaken under other Federal or State authorities. Furthermore,
EPA is proposing a number of changes to the regulations to delete out-of-date provisions, modify the regulations
to address problems in their applicability or implementation, make certain policies and provisions consistent
with the requirements of other Federal statutes, and reduce requirements for PCB disposal activities which present
a 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
de minimis
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 risk. Finally, EPA is proposing certain authorizations and exemptions which would address the need for the scientific
community to conduct research as well as health and environmental studies on PCBs and on media contaminated by PCBs
(to include processing and distribution in commerce of PCBs) for the development of innovative disposal technologies
which otherwise would require issuance of a disposal approval. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The topics to be addressed through this proposed rulemaking include the 16 issues identified in the ANPRM plus a number
of additional issues that have either come to the Agency's attention through the submission of comments or from experience
in implementing the PCB Notification and Manifesting Rule (40 CFR part 761 subparts A, D, J, and K) published in the

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 -->
Federal Register
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 of December 21, 1989 (54 FR 52716). Several changes to the PCB regulations proposed today are in support of EPA's effort
to significantly reduce the risk of release to the environment posed by PCBs still in use. The provisions affected
include the 1&hyph;year time limit for storage and disposal, State enhancement provisions, restrictions on storage
for reuse, decontamination, and the previously proposed changes to transformer reclassification procedures (58
FR 60970, November 18, 1993). EPA's efforts to promote the phase-out of PCBs still in use, especially those in electrical
equipment, go beyond changes in the PCB rules. They include contemplated changes to various compliance monitoring
and enforcement strategies and policies, a greater effort to inform the regulated community of the Agency's position
on PCBs still in use, and expanded cooperation with other Federal and State agencies and departments. EPA is also proposing
a definition at 761.3 of the term ``PCB-Contaminated'' that would apply across the PCB program. PCB-Contaminated
would mean anything that contains or contacts PCBs at concentrations of 50 parts per million (ppm) to less than 500
parts per million (ppm). In the event that no PCB liquids or non-liquids are present on surfaces for measurement, then
surfaces with PCB concentrations greater than 10 micrograms per 100 square centimeters (>10

Background.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 The current PCB regulations generally establish a concentration of 50 parts per million (ppm) as the regulatory threshold
for authorized PCBs in use (i.e., in service). This was based, in part, on the economic impact of the regulations on
electrical transformers, but 50 ppm has been extended to include all authorized PCBs and PCB Articles, as defined
in these proposed rules at 761.3, unless otherwise noted (e.g., PCB concentration of less than 50 ppm resulting from
dilution). Where liquid samples could not be collected, such as on contaminated surfaces, surface sampling and concentration
levels were developed (see part 761, subpart G, The PCB Spill Cleanup Policy). The surface concentrations, which
were based on dermal exposure, were equated to the existing PCB regulations which included economic considerations.
As a result, the regulations established for PCBs at concentrations of 50 to less than 500 ppm were applied to contaminated
surfaces at concentrations of greater than 10 to less than 100 micrograms per 100 square centimeters (>10 &hyph;

). The regulations that EPA is proposing, in several sections of this notice, codify the relationship between surface
contamination and the existing regulations based on milligrams of PCBs per liter of liquid on a dry weight basis. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In the ANPRM, EPA requested comments on the effectiveness of the current PCB regulations in preventing an unreasonable
risk of injury to health and the environment from the disposal of ``large volume, non-liquid PCB wastes'' such as wastes
from the shredding of automobiles, white goods, and industrial scrap, and certain classes of soils, sludges, and
sediments. Currently, large volume wastes derived from an authorized original source containing 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=6 f=2 -->
;
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
50 ppm PCBs may only be disposed of in an incinerator that complies with 40 CFR 761.70, in a chemical waste landfill that
complies with 40 CFR 761.75, or pursuant to an approved alternate method of destruction equivalent to incineration
at 40 CFR 761.60(e), regardless of their current PCB concentration or the risk of exposure they may pose. The Agency
believes that there are additional disposal methods and other waste management techniques for large volume wastes
that would not pose an unreasonable risk of injury to health and the environment. These additional disposal methods
and other waste management techniques are the subject of this section of today's proposed rule. For different kinds
of large volume waste, such as soils, liquids, and surfaces contaminated with PCBs, EPA is proposing several self-implementing
disposal options at 761.61, 761.62 and 761.79. If followed exactly as written, the self-implementing disposal options
would not require prior approval from EPA. These options are detailed and specific. The sampling portions of the self-implementing
procedures appear in Appendices I-III. Placement of the proposed sampling procedures in appendices is intended
to provide better continuity and should facilitate understanding of the overall self-implementing procedures
of which they are a part. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The term ``large volume'' is used to describe wastes that, in general, are generated or managed in greater volumes
than when they were originally placed in service. Large volume wastes would include dredged materials, contaminated
environmental media, municipal sewage treatment sludges, industrial waste water treatment sludges, auto shredder
waste, demolition wastes, and specifically listed materials containing PCBs that may not be authorized for use,
such as PCB impregnated insulation or gaskets. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Large volume PCB wastes would not include wastes that are PCB Items, PCB Articles, and PCB liquids being removed from
service. PCB liquids include, but are not limited to, dielectric fluid and solvents used to flush PCB Transformers
prior to landfilling (GE Solvent Distillation Case [Docket No. TSCA-IV-890016]). Large volume PCB wastes would
not include the more traditional PCB wastes which are typically generated and managed in discrete, relatively small
volumes associated with individual pieces of electrical, mechanical, heat transfer, or other equipment. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Large volume PCB wastes are frequently heterogenous in nature and contaminated with low (i.e., 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=6 f=2 -->
&lt;
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
50 ppm) or varying levels of PCBs and other constituents. Although these wastes may now pose little environmental
risk, under the current PCB regulations, they are usually required to be disposed of, based on their original PCB concentration,
in either a TSCA chemical waste landfill or TSCA incinerator. Second, as the name of the category implies, ``large
volume'' wastes may be generated each year in enormous amounts. However, the actual magnitude of the problem is not
well documented. EPA requested information about historic PCB disposal sites, including areas of major or longterm
spills (46 FR 22144, April 15, 1981) and included these data in its listing of sites known as the Comprehensive Environmental
Response, Compensation and Liability Act Information System or CERCLIS. While EPA does not have information characterizing
every site where PCBs were spilled or disposed of, the Agency does have estimates of the number of sites contaminated
with PCBs. In 1991, EPA's Office of Emergency and Remedial Response completed a characterization of 1,218 sites associated
with the National Priorities List (NPL) and 29,461 sites associated with CERCLIS. At approximately 20 percent of
the NPL sites and approximately 7 percent of the CERCLIS sites, PCBs were characterized as a ``predominant'' waste
type. The NPL sites alone contain approximately 34,070,000 cubic yards of material contaminated with PCBs and other
substances. Similarly, the weight of shredder waste produced annually by metal recyclers is approximately 3 million
tons. Commercial disposal costs of these types of large volume wastes at PCB incinerators or landfills have been as
high as $2,300 per cubic yard for incineration, and $550 per cubic yard for chemical waste landfilling. Based on this
information concerning large volume PCB waste generation, the number of old PCB disposal sites, and the cost of disposal,
EPA believes that it is appropriate to commence rulemaking to address the management and disposal of large volume
PCB wastes and propose alternatives to the current available disposal options. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Therefore, for PCB remediation wastes, EPA is proposing to allow alternatives to the regulatory mandate that PCB
wastes must be managed based on the requirements for disposal at the time the contaminating PCBs came out of service
(i.e., based on the original PCB concentration of the material (see unit II.A.4. of this preamble). The remediation
requirements proposed in 761.61(a) address indirect exposure issues by limiting the applicability of the section
to environmental settings which are less likely to allow migration and therefore should be easier to characterize
and remediate. All other environmental settings are addressed under the proposed ``risk-based'' option (761.61(c))
where EPA could require a site-specific indirect exposure as well as direct exposure risk assessment. As a point of
clarification, since spills result in an illegal release of PCBs to the environment, only those wastes cleaned up
and disposed of in accordance with the PCB Spill Cleanup Policy (40 CFR part 761, subpart G) will be entitled to the presumption
against enforcement of a disposal violation for that spill. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
PCB non-remediation wastes (Unit II.A.6. of this preamble provides further discussion) are often found in large
volumes and in a physical state that tends to limit the mobility of the PCBs (e.g., PCBs used as a plasticizer). In this
instance, EPA is recognizing the reduced risk of direct or indirect exposure and the overall volume of this category
of waste when it considers additional options for disposal. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Elsewhere in today's notice, EPA is also reproposing a process for determining the concentration of PCBs in a multiphasic
media such as sludges or sediments (see Unit III. M. of this preamble). EPA would require that this process be followed
by those using the provisions established for the disposal of large volume wastes and, in general, for determining
the concentration of PCBs.

 Anti-dilution.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 The current rule at 40 CFR 761.1(b), commonly known as the ``anti-dilution'' rule, prohibits the avoidance of specific
disposal requirements because a PCB concentration was reduced or shifted from one material or environmental medium
to another as the result of adding a diluent, or separating or concentrating the PCBs. This provision remains in effect.
EPA is not promoting intentional or fortuitous dilution in either its rules or enforcement policies. However, EPA
is proposing greater flexibility in choosing a disposal option for this category of large volume PCB wastes. EPA remains
committed to a policy of stringent regulation of the disposal of PCB wastes. EPA is simply recognizing that where PCBs
have already been released into the environment the critical disposal issue becomes one of mitigating the damage
from the release, especially those aspects of indirect exposure such as bioaccumulation.

 Status of pre-1978 disposal.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 Several commenters asked for clarification of the rules under TSCA governing the regulatory status and remediation
of PCB spills and disposal sites in light of the ruling by EPA's Chief Judicial Officer in Re: Standard Scrap Metal Company,
TSCA-V-C-288, Appeal No. 87&hyph;4, August 2, 1990 (Standard Scrap). 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Chief Judicial Officer (CJO) held that spilled PCBs found in soil are not necessarily in a ``disposal site'' for
purposes of the prefatory note exclusion to 761.60. ``Soil does not become a disposal site merely because PCBs are
spilled onto it'' (CJO's ruling page 13, paragraph 1). In this decision, the CJO limited the effect of the prefatory
note to pre-1978 landfills or dumps, i.e., only those PCBs disposed in landfills and dumps may be considered ``in-service''
and do not require proper disposal according to 40 CFR part 761, subpart D. EPA is proposing to delete the prefatory
note to 761.60, which states that PCBs disposed of prior to the effective date of the regulations were considered to
be ``in use'' and therefore did not need to be cleaned up under these rules, and substitute language on the disposition
of PCB waste disposed of before 1978 as introductory text to this section. Under the proposed rule, PCBs disposed of,
placed in a land disposal facility (such as a dump, landfill, waste pile, or land treatment unit) or PCBs spilled or
otherwise released to the environment, including areas contaminated by spills and releases such as sediments, prior
to April 18, 1978, would be presumed to be disposed of in a manner that does not present a risk of exposure, and would not
necessarily require further disposal action. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
This proposed provision would allow the Regional Administrator, on a case-by-case basis, to make a finding that any
pre-1978 disposal site does present a risk of exposure, whether the site be a spill, dump, land treatment unit, waste
pile, stream, river, pond, lake, any sediment (or dredge material from a stream, river, pond, or lake), ground water,
surface water, landfill, or any other type of disposal site. In such a case, the Regional Administrator could then
require the submission of an application for approval of a risk-based disposal method under proposed 761.61(c) (see
Unit II.A.4. of this preamble). Failure to submit a complete application, in the timeframe stipulated in the Regional
Administrator's ``call-in'' letter, would be a violation, and the violations would accrue from that day forward.
EPA believes that pre-1978 PCB disposal units or areas of contamination should not be allowed to remain ``in-service''
and thus unaddressed, as the existing prefatory note currently allows, if there is a risk of exposure from these sites.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Sites that could be considered an immediate exposure risk include, but are not limited to, school yards, food or feed
areas, residential areas, underground or surface waters, well head protection areas, and certain stream, river,
or lake sediments. In such cases where the Regional Administrator has made a determination that there is a risk of exposure,
the site would have to be cleaned up, based on the exposure risk finding. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Also, in the introductory paragraph at 761.60, EPA is proposing to add language to instruct those whose waste is subject
to the disposal provisions of subpart D to refer back to both the authorizations section at 761.30 and the prohibitions
section at 761.20 and to coordinate their disposal activities with other agencies where appropriate for all PCB wastes.
It is important for members of the regulated community to be cognizant of the fact that the disposal options in subpart
D hinge on certain prohibitions as well as authorizations. For example, not all PCB Items would be required to be disposed
of. Some items, such as natural gas pipelines containing PCBs, if properly decontaminated, could be reused. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Many other Federal, State, and local laws and regulations apply to the disposal of PCBs. Although EPA attempts to coordinate
with the various Federal, State, and local programs controlling PCBs, the ultimate responsibility for coordination
and compliance rests with the regulated community.

 On June 10, 1991, EPA also published a notice of availability of a draft guidance document outlining several alternative
methods of treatment for certain classes of media containing PCBs (56 FR 26745). That document is entitled ``Interim
Guidance on Non-Liquid PCB Disposal Methods to be Used as Alternatives to a 40 CFR 761.75 Chemical Waste Landfill (CWL).''
Generally, commenters to the ANPRM who addressed the issue of alternative methods of treatment and commenters to
the draft interim guidance, stated that a wider range of options would not only provide much needed disposal flexibility,
but would provide an incentive for developing alternative methods of PCB disposal. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In response to these comments, the proposed rule at 761.61(c) would authorize the Regional Administrator, based
on a site-specific risk assessment, to approve an application for different cleanup and disposal requirements provided
that they would not pose an unreasonable risk of injury to health or the environment. The wide range of different methods
of disposal that could be approved by the Regional Administrator upon application include thermal destruction such
as infrared thermal treatment or circulating bed combustor; physical separation such as thermal treatment (rotary
thermal desorber and fluidized bed) and solvent extraction (soil washing and liquified gas); solidification/stabilization
such as chemical fixation (encapsulation,

 vitrification; biological treatment; and chemical dechlorination. These are not the only treatment methods that
could be approved by the Regional Administrator upon application; but are the methods currently being used with varying
degrees of success. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Commenters suggested several potentially viable alternatives for the disposal of large volume PCB wastes, some
of which were not listed in the draft alternative disposal document that accompanied the June 10, 1991, publication
of the ANPRM. As indicated in this proposed rule, upon application to the Regional Administrator, each proposed option
would be considered on a case-by-case basis. Some commenters suggested that the need to obtain a disposal permit was
an impediment to developing and utilizing alternative methods of destruction and containment. EPA's position is
that adequate controls must be imposed to ensure the safety of all disposal technologies, especially those being
operated on a commercial scale. EPA does, however, anticipate that as individual or combinations of technologies
are used repeatedly, the permitting process will become streamlined. Once out of the research and development (R&amp;D)
phase, new technologies will receive the same level of scrutiny as those already fully developed to ensure adequate
environmental controls of specific technologies. In certain instances, specific standards, technologies, or
procedures could also be promulgated in future rulemakings as additional decontamination activities at 761.79
or added to the self-implementing remediation techniques in 761.61(a) (see Unit II.A.3. of this preamble).

 The 1987 TSCA PCB Spill Cleanup Policy, published on April 2, 1987 (52 FR 10688), codified at part 761, subpart G, applied
only to certain releases of PCBs occurring after May 4, 1987. Thus, other spills of PCBs (i.e., most notably those which
occurred prior to May 4, 1987), were not intended to be subject to the provisions of the Policy. The issue of whether
the Agency should develop a cleanup policy for historic PCB spills, and how such a policy might differ from the existing
policy for new spills, was addressed in the ANPRM. In response to this discussion, several commenters on the ANPRM
strongly supported the idea of developing an EPA policy on historic PCB spills. Those commenters suggested that such
a policy could achieve considerable benefits at historic PCB spill sites, similar to those that have been obtained
for new PCB spills under the 1987 policy. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In light of these comments, and in consideration of the Agency's experience with implementing the 1987 cleanup policy
for new spills, EPA is today proposing a strategy under TSCA for cleanup of all PCBs in the environment. The following
preamble also discusses how PCBs would be addressed under the remedial authorities of RCRA and CERCLA. In addition,
EPA is today proposing to clarify the concentration level for soil contaminated with PCBs that was identified as an
``action level'' in the proposed RCRA Corrective Action Regulations (55 FR 30798, July 27, 1990).

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
 Background.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 As part of the development of the 1987 TSCA PCB Spill Cleanup Policy, EPA evaluated the frequency, amount, and nature
of PCB spills from electrical equipment, the different routes of exposure to PCBs (i.e., ingestion, dermal, and inhalation),
the risks posed by spills in different locations, and the costs of cleanup. After evaluating this information and
considering a spill cleanup proposal submitted to EPA by the Environmental Defense Fund (EDF), the Natural Resources
Defense Council (NRDC), the Edison Electric Institute (EEI), the Chemical Manufacturers Association (CMA), and
the National Electrical Manufacturers Association (NEMA), EPA developed cleanup goals for PCBs in soil and on surfaces.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The TSCA PCB Spill Cleanup Policy requires cleanup of PCBs to different levels depending upon spill location, the
potential for exposure to residual PCBs remaining after cleanup, the concentration of PCBs initially spilled (high
concentration or low), and the nature and size of the population potentially at risk of exposure to residual PCBs.
Thus, the TSCA PCB Spill Cleanup Policy applies the most stringent requirements for PCB spill cleanup to non-restricted
access areas where there is a greater potential for human exposures to spilled PCBs. The TSCA PCB Spill Cleanup Policy
applies less stringent requirements for cleanup of PCB spills in restricted access areas where the nature and degree
of human contact present a lower potential for significant exposure. Finally, even less stringent requirements
apply to restricted access areas where there is little potential for human exposures. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Implementation of the 1987 TSCA PCB Spill Cleanup Policy has, in EPA's estimation, yielded highly favorable environmental
results. Large numbers of PCB spills have been cleaned up expeditiously and safely with minimum administrative burdens
to regulatory agencies or responsible parties. This success is in large part attributable to the self-implementing
nature of the policy; the clear, numeric cleanup goals specified in the policy; and the straightforward sampling
and notification procedures required of those responding to PCB spills. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Although the 1987 policy was intended to be applicable to ``new'' spills of PCBs, the policy has also been used in the
cleanup of historic spills, particularly in the context of CERCLA remediations. As discussed below, since 1990 the
Superfund program has adopted an approach to cleanup of PCBs that relies heavily on the 1987 TSCA policy. Although
the CERCLA (and RCRA) remedial process generates large volumes of site-specific information that can be used to ``fine
tune'' cleanup decisions for PCBs, as well as other hazardous substances, it has been the Agency's experience that
the essential features of the 1987 TSCA policy are workable and yield protective cleanup results for historic spills
of PCBs. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The following discussion summarizes the approach that the CERCLA program has taken in adapting the 1987 PCB Spill
Cleanup Policy to Superfund cleanups. It also outlines a similar proposed approach for the RCRA corrective action
program.

 CERCLA program policy for cleanup of PCBs.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 Because the TSCA PCB Spill Cleanup Policy is not a binding regulation, it is not a potentially applicable or relevant
and appropriate requirement (i.e., an ARAR) for Superfund response actions. However, as a codified policy reflecting
substantial scientific and technical evaluation, it has been considered as important guidance in developing cleanup
levels at Superfund sites. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In August 1990, EPA issued several CERCLA guidance documents regarding remediation of PCBs at Superfund sites. Among
other provisions, these guidance documents establish guidelines for the CERCLA Program to follow in setting preliminary
remediation goals for PCBs for soil, ground water, and sediment contaminated with PCBs at Superfund sites. (See ``A
Guide on Remedial Actions at Superfund Sites with PCB Contamination'', OSWER Directive No. 9355.4&hyph;01 FS (August
1990) [``PCB Guide''].) 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Preliminary remediation goals (PRGs) in the Superfund program are specific statements of the desired endpoint concentrations
of contaminants, or risk levels for each exposure route, that are believed to provide adequate protection of health
and the environment based on preliminary site information. (See preamble to the National Contingency Plan (NCP),
55 FR 8666, 8712 and 8713 (March 8, 1992).) These goals are also used in setting parameters for the purpose of developing
remedial alternatives. Because PRGs are formulated early in the remedial evaluation process, they are typically
based on readily available information, such as environmental or health-based ARAR's other reliable guidance or
information, commonly referred to in the CERCLA program as To Be Considered or (TBCs), or the ``point of departure''
risk level of 10
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=1 -->
-6
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
. As additional information becomes available during the Remedial Investigation/Feasibility Study (RI/FS) process,
the PRGs may be modified due to consideration of exposure, technical, or other factors (55 FR 8713 and 8717). The use
of PRGs does not preclude development and consideration or selection for alternatives that attain risk levels other
than those represented by the PRG. Final selection of the appropriate level of risk is made based on the balancing of
criteria in the remedy selection step of the process. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Along the same lines, the 1990 CERCLA PCB guidance documents explain that exceedance of a PRG for PCBs does not mean
that action is required. Rather, once the CERCLA program decides that action is necessary at a site, the PRGs for PCBs
should be used to identify areas at which response action should be considered. ``These goals may be refined throughout
the RI/FS process; final remediation goals are determined in the remedy selection.'' (PCB Guide, p.2). 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
According to the CERCLA PCB guidance, the concentration of concern for PCBs in soil differs depending on the type of
exposure that is expected (e.g. residential or industrial) The guidance documents point out that site-specific
conditions may warrant departure from the basic framework outlined in the guidance, due to factors such as the potential
for PCBs to migrate to groundwater and to affect environmental receptors. The guidance recommends that in most cases,
the preliminary remediation goals (or ``analytical starting points'' for setting remedial levels) for PCBs in soil
under CERCLA are as follows: 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The TSCA PCB Spill Policy at 761.120, recommends PCB spills be cleaned up to the following levels: For current and reasonably-expected
future residential and other non-restricted access areas: less than 1 ppm on the surface to a depth of 10 inches and
10 ppm at depths below 10 inches; for industrial and other restricted access areas: 25 ppm; and for outdoor electrical
substations: 25 ppm, or 50 ppm with labelling warning of presence of PCBs (not expected at CERCLA sites). In the case
of remediation for residential, unrestricted land use at CERCLA sites, 1 ppm soil PCBs at the surface is recommended
by the Superfund program as a PRG to address threats posed by direct contact. Where soil with concentrations greater
than 1 ppm PCBs is left in place for residential land use, the depth of soil cover is determined by site-specific conditions.
In such cases, appropriate deed restrictions or other institutional controls are generally implemented. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In the case of remediating for industrial, restricted land use at CERCLA sites, a range of 10 ppm soil PCBs to 25 ppm soil
PCBs at the surface is recommended by the Superfund program as a PRG to address threats posed by direct contact.

 Proposed approach for cleanup of PCBs under RCRA corrective action authorities
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
. In the July 27, 1990, proposed RCRA Corrective Action Rule, 55 FR 30798, EPA introduced the concept of ``action levels''
as trigger levels for further study and subsequent remediation at RCRA facilities. In the RCRA Corrective Action
Program, a remedial investigation may indicate that levels of contamination from a past release are unlikely to present
a threat to health and the environment. EPA proposed that measured levels in the environment be compared to action
levels, and that in situations where measured levels are below action levels, EPA would not normally require either
further study (i.e., a Corrective Measures Study) or remediation. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In the proposed RCRA Corrective Action Rule, EPA proposed using maximum contaminant levels (MCLs) promulgated under
the Safe Drinking Water Act as action levels for ground water. For other media (including soils) and for constituents
in ground water that do not have established MCLs, the following criteria were proposed for establishing action levels.
First, the concentration for a hazardous constituent must be derived in a manner consistent with Agency guidelines
for risk assessment. Second, the studies used to derive action levels must be scientifically valid. Third, the concentrations
used as action levels would be (for carcinogens) associated with a 1

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 risk level for Class C carcinogens. For systemic toxicants, the action level would be a concentration to which humans
could be exposed on a daily basis without appreciable risk of adverse effects during a lifetime. The exposure scenario
used for calculating the action levels was direct contact (i.e., ingestion), assuming residential land use. EPA's
proposal included in 264.521(d) a separate provision establishing criteria for establishing action levels for
soil, assuming exposure through consumption of the soil contaminated with a hazardous constituent. However, EPA
proposed to make an exception to this approach where EPA has already established standards for remediation of spilled
PCBs under the TSCA PCB Spill Cleanup Policy. In the preamble, EPA explained that the Agency had determined that the
standards in the TSCA PCB Spill Cleanup Policy should be used as action levels and cleanup standards for soil in RCRA
corrective actions (55 FR 30819). 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Proposed Appendix A, to part 264, subpart S, provided examples of concentration levels that meet the above criteria
for action levels for more than 150 hazardous constituents. However, EPA erred in setting out the concentration level
for PCBs in soil in Appendix A (55 FR 30867). EPA had intended to list 1 ppm, the cleanup goal recommended by the TSCA PCB
Spill Cleanup Policy for residential land use, as the action level for PCBs. Instead the action level listed in Appendix
A for PCBs in soil was 0.09 ppm. EPA is requesting comment on correcting this erroneous listing. EPA believes that adding
the following clarifying language to the end of 264.521(d): ``Action levels for PCBs in soils shall be defined as 1
ppm consistent with the TSCA PCB Spill Cleanup Policy at part 761 subpart G,'' would correct the error.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
EPA believes that it is appropriate to adopt the TSCA 1 ppm level for PCBs as the action level for use under the RCRA corrective
action program. As previously discussed, 1 ppm is the cleanup goal recommended by the PCB Spill Cleanup Policy for
residential land use. Thus, the TSCA spill cleanup level is approximately one order of magnitude greater than the
action level identified in the subpart S preamble. However, the Agency believes that adopting the 1 ppm level for RCRA
may be appropriate, for several reasons. For one thing, the 1 ppm TSCA level is based on the same residential land use
scenario and essentially the same exposure assumptions used in deriving the RCRA action levels. It also represents
the same general ``conservativeness'' as an action level, in that it equates to a 10
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=1 -->
-5
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 excess lifetime cancer risk. In addition, the TSCA level was developed based on substantial studies conducted by
the Agency that focused specifically on the risks posed by PCBs, as well as other relevant factors relating to cleanup
of PCBs. Finally, 1 ppm is close to the analytical detection limit for soil, whereas the action level of 0.09 ppm identified
in the subpart S proposal may often be below detection limits. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Agency recognizes that adopting the TSCA 1 ppm level as an action level under RCRA would depart somewhat from how
other soil action levels are set. It would be a level established under another regulatory program and, as such, may
reflect certain factors that were not otherwise considered in developing the action level concept under RCRA. On
the other hand, adopting the TSCA level for soils would be very much analogous to using MCLs as action levels for ground
water as discussed in the July 27, 1990 proposal (see 55 FR 30819 and 30853). 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
It should also be noted that adopting the 1 ppm action level for PCBs requires certain explicit revisions to the proposed
subpart S regulations. Specifically, as discussed above, the proposed criteria for soil action levels that were
specified in proposed 264.521(d) would need to be revised to explicitly identify the 1 ppm level for PCBs. In addition,
Appendix A to part 264 subpart S would require an amendment to identify the new PCB action level. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Agency solicits comment on today's proposal for adopting 1 ppm as the action level for PCBs in soil for the purpose
of implementing corrective actions at RCRA regulated facilities. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Although the PCB Spill Cleanup Policy identifies other numbers that are generally appropriate for certain land use
settings, the Agency believes that these levels are inappropriate for use as action levels, because they may often
require substantial site-specific information and determinations by the Agency about current and future land use
and exposure potential. This is inconsistent with the action level concept, which requires identifying conservative,
presumptive levels that can be established without this type of site-specific information. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
However, the Agency believes that many of the provisions of the PCB Spill Cleanup Policy may be appropriate in making
decisions regarding cleanup levels in the context of RCRA corrective action. In the preamble to the proposed subpart
S regulations, EPA stated that the cleanup levels and practices in the PCB Spill Cleanup Policy would generally be
appropriate for use in addressing PCB releases under RCRA corrective actions. The Agency wishes to reaffirm its intention
to use the 1987 spill policy as guidance for cleanup of PCBs in the corrective action program in essentially the same
manner as has been identified in the Superfund guidance discussed above. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
It should be noted that the Superfund guidance on PCBs focused primarily on the use of the PCB Spill Cleanup Policy in
establishing preliminary remediation goals, or PRGs. The subpart S proposal did not provide an explicit regulatory
framework for setting PRGs during the corrective action process; however, the preamble to the proposal did acknowledge
that establishing such preliminary cleanup goals may often be appropriate in a RCRA context. The Agency may address
this issue more thoroughly in subsequent RCRA rulemakings. In any case, EPA intends to use the general approach outlined
in the Superfund PCB guidance in establishing preliminary cleanup goals (when appropriate), as well as ``final''
cleanup levels for PCB contamination at RCRA facilities. As explained in the CERCLA guidance, the levels specified
in the TSCA PCB Spill Cleanup Policy would generally be examined in light of site-specific information, and that the
Agency would preserve the flexibility inherent in the subpart S provisions for establishing cleanup standards,
to select a cleanup level for PCBs that may depart from the TSCA PCB Spill Cleanup Policy, when appropriate. (See proposed
264.525(d), 55 FR 30877, July 27, 1990.) 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Agency solicits comment on the concept, as outlined above, of using the TSCA PCB Spill Cleanup Policy as general
guidance for establishing cleanup levels under RCRA corrective action authorities. The Agency also solicits comment
on specific provisions of the TSCA PCB Spill Cleanup Policy for which it may be appropriate to modify or supplement
for use in establishing cleanup levels under RCRA.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
 Today's proposed remediation strategy for PCB spills under TSCA.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 EPA is today proposing a new strategy under TSCA for cleanup of all PCBs in the environment that is closely modeled after
the 1987 TSCA PCB Spill Cleanup Policy for new PCB spills from electrical equipment. The Agency believes that adopting
such a strategy is warranted, for several reasons. EPA's experience with PCB cleanups under CERCLA has shown that
the general approach and the specific cleanup goals expressed in the 1987 Policy are generally appropriate for cleanup
of PCBs not directly addressed under the policy, as long as flexibility is provided for factoring site-specific conditions
into final cleanup decisions. In addition, cleanup of PCBs not directly addressed currently under the policy must
be addressed under TSCA on a case-by-case basis, with oversight of the cleanup action by EPA Regions. This can require
considerable paperwork and lengthy negotiations between regulators and responsible parties over cleanup goals
and procedures at individual sites. Adopting a simpler, more uniform yet flexible strategy for cleanup of PCBs in
the environment under TSCA would thus serve to reduce administrative and other transactional costs and accelerate
the cleanup process. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
EPA is not convinced that there is any compelling technical or environmental rationale for having several separate
and inconsistent methods for cleaning up PCB spills, based simply on when the spill occurred. Under TSCA, the new strategy
and administrative procedures propose to address the problem of PCBs in the environment through a flexible, tiered
approach. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
EPA is proposing that PCBs disposed of, placed in a land disposal facility, spilled, or otherwise released into the
environment prior to April 18, 1978 would be presumed to be disposed of in a manner which does not present a risk of exposure
(i.e., the PCBs are presumed to be safely disposed of) unless EPA makes a finding that there is a risk of exposure (see
761.60 proposed revised introductory text in the codified portion of this document). EPA could then require that
an application be submitted for approval of remediation and proper disposal of those PCB remediation wastes under
the proposed 761.61(c). All other PCB remediation wastes would be addressed by one of several alternatives proposed
today. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In certain scenarios PCBs could be remediated to specified levels and treated under the self-implementing provisions
proposed at 761.61(a). This activity would be conducted with a minimum of interaction between EPA and the party conducting
the remediation, but it would require that the specified conditions be followed without variance. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Any PCB remediation waste could be cleaned up under the risk-based provisions proposed at 761.61(c). This new provision
would be harmonized with the RCRA and CERCLA programs. Any changes of the levels under RCRA and CERCLA would be reflected
in a change under TSCA in the target standards. While 761.61(c) would provide flexibility based on site-specific
assessment of the risks posed, it would also be the most resource intensive and time consuming to implement. All actions
addressing PCBs under Superfund would use 761.61(c) as the relevant requirement under TSCA thus providing the flexibility
necessary to implement site-specific remedial actions. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
EPA is also proposing to retain the traditional disposal options under proposed 761.61(b) for incineration, alternate
treatment technologies, and chemical waste landfilling. This section could be used where all PCB remediation waste
would be removed from the environment, or where remediation levels were established elsewhere in these rules. Section
761.61(b) could also be used where a mechanism such as a State established cleanup was recognized by EPA through a coordinated
approval under proposed 761.77, where a State had already established a site characterization and/or remediation
plan requiring off-site disposal in a facility with a TSCA disposal approval for PCBs. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The current TSCA PCB Spill Cleanup Policy would still be available to address recent spills from electrical equipment.
The party responsible for a spill which was eligible for cleanup under the spill policy would also have the option of
using one of the alternatives available under proposed 761.61 or 761.79 (Decontamination), where applicable. It
should be noted that, in accordance with the anti-dilution provisions of 761.1(b), if the contamination was from
an authorized use, then the PCB remediation waste is regulated based on the regulatory status of the PCBs at the time
of their release into the environment. The following illustrates this point. A transformer contains PCB dielectric
fluid at 1,000 ppm. The unit leaks its dielectric fluid, and all resulting PCB remediation waste is regulated, regardless
of concentration, because the original dielectric fluid was regulated at the time of the leak. However, if the same
PCB Transformer is first reclassified to non-PCB status (i.e., less than 50 ppm PCB in the dielectric fluid) and non-PCB
dielectric fluid leaks, none of the resulting remediation waste is regulated under TSCA (but not necessarily other
laws or regulations) because the dielectric fluid was unregulated at the time of the leak. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
There are two questions associated with any cleanup. The first question is to what level must contamination be cleaned
and the second question is what are the disposal requirements for the contaminated material. In general, the current
PCB rules address the disposal question by stating that PCBs diluted through acts such as spilling or processing for
disposal must be disposed of based on the disposal requirements for that PCB concentration at the time the PCBs came
out of service or were spilled. However, except for those scenarios addressed by the TSCA PCB Spill Cleanup Policy,
the current rules require complete removal of spilled or otherwise improperly disposed of PCBs. Most commenters
to the ANPRM were very supportive of the Agency's desire to amend the current rules to allow the management of remediation
wastes based on their current PCB concentrations and the site-specific risk from exposure. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Several commenters asked that EPA address the question of cleanup levels by establishing, in this rule, national
standards for specific exposure scenarios, with provisions for variances that would be binding, for remediation
of wastes containing PCBs for all Federal programs that would be preemptive of State and local requirements. These
commenters suggested that this approach could reduce the ``transactional'' costs associated with site-by-site
negotiations, promote voluntary remediation activities and, in general, speed the cleanup of sites. EPA has limited
authority under TSCA to preempt State or local requirements for the cleanup or disposal of PCB remediation wastes.
With regard to establishing uniform standards for specific exposure scenarios for the remediation of PCBs and other
hazardous substances or constituents, EPA has contemplated the following options: (a) Setting specific standards,
(b) using a uniform decision-making process with target standards, but allowing site-specific variances, or (c)
using a uniform decision-making process with a general goal and site-specific application. EPA believes that specific
standards are most appropriate when dealing with common disposal scenarios and limited disposal options. Favoring
site-specific approaches to remediate old spills is most appropriate when there is little commonality at the various
sites among the problems being addressed and the available disposal options. Except for the limited scenarios proposed
in 761.61(a), EPA does not believe that it has sufficient experience or information to establish additional self-implementing
cleanup and disposal options. EPA is seeking comments, supported by technical information from those engaged in
remedial actions; other Federal, State or local entities responsible for the implementation or oversight of remedial
actions; and the general public on all three approaches including the following proposal. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Several remedial approaches could be proposed for any given site which is contaminated with PCBs. In this section,
EPA is proposing three alternatives for the cleanup and disposal of PCB remediation waste under TSCA. The first alternative
would be self-implementing. The term self-implementing means that EPA approval under TSCA would not be necessary
as long as the entire remediation conformed to the procedures and standards of the first alternative at proposed 761.61(a).
The second alternative, performance-based disposal, is the use of ``traditional'' disposal technologies of incineration
and chemical waste landfilling, according to the approval process and standards as proposed at 761.61(b). The third
alternative, risk-based disposal, is a process and decision document not unlike the Superfund remedial action decision-making
process and record of decision (ROD). Each step would be approved by the Regional Administrator having jurisdiction
over the site which is contaminated with PCBs, including a risk assessment and any onsite treatment, or redisposition
of treated or untreated remediation waste at the site. Treatment levels would be based on a site-specific risk assessment
described at proposed 761.61(c). Those seeking a PCB disposal approval could also avail themselves of the ``Coordinated
Approval'' provision (see Unit III.K.1. of this preamble). This alternative would allow the recognition of a cleanup
action conducted under another authority such as a RCRA corrective action permit or in compliance with a CERCLA ROD
or enforcement decision document.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
 Self-implementing option.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 The self-implementing alternative is patterned after the PCB Spill Cleanup Policy (40 CFR part 761, subpart G), which
sets standards for cleaning up spills shortly after they occur. Like the PCB Spill Cleanup Policy, this proposed alternative
requires that risk-based surface and soil levels be achieved. However, an important distinction between subpart
G and the proposed self-implementing alternative is that for non-recent spills, there may be limited information
concerning the concentration and amount of PCBs released to the environment and the time, nature, and extent of that
release and any subsequent migration. Subpart G established spill cleanup requirements addressing the concentration
and amount of spilled materials based on the location of the spill and potential exposure to the spilled PCBs. Spill
cleanup in this proposal is based on the current concentration in the material onto which a spill occurred. The extent
of migration of the spill is likely to be greater for an old spill than for a more recent or new spill. This difference
plus the requirement for rapid initiation and containment of the spill were partly responsible for the provision
at 40 CFR 761.135 which creates a presumption against an enforcement action for penalties for the act of illegal disposal.
While the self-implementing proposal allows disposal of remediation waste according to the waste's current existing
concentration, the proposal does not create a presumption against enforcement action for penalties for the act of
unauthorized disposal. Another significant difference from subpart G is that the self-implementing disposal requirements
would not apply to certain environmental and exposure scenarios having the potential for a high risk of exposure.
Subpart G allows certain residual levels to remain after cleanup based on the potential future use of the site, including
the imposition of physical or institutional restrictions limiting access, which could have been incorrectly assumed
to always directly correlate with exposure in those areas. Today's proposal addresses residual levels based not
only on access to areas, but also potential exposure to residual PCB levels within those areas. For example, a restricted
access commercial area might limit who could be exposed, but might not limit how much a person with access could be exposed.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In this proposal, concrete is not considered a non-porous surface as it is in subpart G (see the proposed definition
of ``non-porous surface'' at 761.3). Consequently, concrete containing PCBs would have to be removed rather than
just wiped off. The size of the remediation area is not an issue with today's self-implementing proposal as it is with
subpart G. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The self-implementing option differentiates between the cleanup of a site and the disposal of PCB remediation waste
from the site. Cleanup means the identification and reduction of the PCB concentrations, and/or removal of PCB remediation
waste to a specified residual PCB concentration at its existing location. The cleanup portion of this alternative
allows remediation waste with specified PCB levels to remain undisturbed at the site and not be disposed of. Cleanup
may be followed by either (or both) off-site disposal of a certain amount of PCB remediation waste, or treatment of
a certain amount of remediation waste at the site. Disposal means the movement of PCB remediation wastes from the site
of contamination to another location for destruction or containment (off-site disposal) or the destruction or containment
of PCB remediation waste at the cleanup site (on-site disposal). Section 761.61 would apply to the cleanup and disposal
of all PCB remediation wastes regardless of when the disposal, spill, or contamination occurred. Subpart G would
continue to apply to recent spills from electrical equipment; however, the party responsible for the spill and cleanup
could choose to follow 761.61. There are other conforming changes which could be made to 40 CFR part 761, subpart G,
resulting from this proposal. These changes have not been made because those who were a party to the negotiation of
subpart G have not been a direct party to the development of this proposal. Nevertheless, the conforming changes to
subpart G have been accounted for in this proposal and the proposal is consistent with the conforming changes, especially
with respect to references of ``old'' spills. Section 761.61 specifically applies to ``old'' spills. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The self-implementing remediation option proposes on-site disposal to specified cleanup levels of residual PCBs
in the PCB remediation waste. Cleanup levels would be more stringent for high exposure areas than for low exposure
areas, as these terms would be defined in 761.3. Three self-implementing on-site options are proposed: capping higher
residual levels (a definition of ``cap'' is proposed at 761.3), ``treating down'' from higher levels to lower levels
on-site using a non-chlorinated solvent washing process; and microencapsulation or vitrification (definitions
of these terms are proposed at 761.3). These last two immobilization technologies are being proposed because they
have been promulgated under RCRA for debris which is contaminated with both RCRA hazardous waste and TSCA PCB waste
(see 57 FR 37194 &hyph;37282, August 18, 1992). Based on EPA's experience with approving PCB disposal technologies,
the solvent washing process is the only currently available destruction or physical separation PCB disposal process
considered generally effective in a variety of situations, commercially feasible at ambient temperatures (i.e.,
no external heat source), and safe enough to be conducted without prior approval. EPA will consider these factors,
along with the general statutory requirement to prevent unreasonable risk of injury to health and the environment,
in considering the addition, under 761.61(c), of other processes, procedures, or technologies to 761.61(a). EPA
specifically requests comments on the best method to expeditiously include new universally acceptable risk-based
treatment technologies as self-implementing treatment options prior to amendment of 761.61(a) in the 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 -->
Federal Register
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
. The kind of solvent washing process EPA proposes for treating PCBs removes PCBs from the waste, separates the PCBs
from the solvent, and reuses the solvent while disposing of the PCBs. Residual levels of solvent in the treated PCB
remediation waste must correspond to allowable levels under all other Federal and local regulations, including
requirements under RCRA and regulations of the Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA). For other
techniques such as vitrification, EPA is concerned about additional issues such as the release of volatile products
of incomplete combustion (PICs) especially when the process is conducted 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
in-situ
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
. If EPA cannot devise a procedure or prescribe a technology for addressing the issue of volatile PICs, vitrification
will be deleted from option (a) and only considered under option (c) in a risk-based approval. EPA specifically requests
comment and supporting technical information on this issue. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
RCRA uses the Toxicity Characteristic Leaching Procedure (TCLP), (40 CFR part 261 Appendix II, Method 1311), its
model for co-disposal of potentially hazardous wastes with municipal solid waste in a landfill. Under RCRA regulations,
the assumption is that if a waste does not exhibit the toxicity characteristic (and is otherwise not hazardous), it
does not need to be disposed of as a hazardous waste; thus, it can be placed in a solid waste landfill (40 CFR 261.3). EPA
is drawing a parallel to the RCRA rules for disposal of certain treated remediation wastes under TSCA. EPA is proposing
to use the RCRA TCLP as a measure of effectiveness of microencapsulation or vitrification of PCB containing remediation
wastes. Using the RCRA model for establishing toxic contaminant levels, EPA is proposing 50 micrograms per liter
(i.e., approximately 50 parts per billion [ppb]) as the treatability level for extractable PCBs. (The Toxicity Characteristic
(TC) level for PCBs was proposed and subsequently withdrawn (see 57 FR 21520, May 20, 1992 and 57 FR 49280, October 30,
1992)). If adopted under TSCA, any PCB remediation waste that has been microencapsulated or vitrified and subsequently
shown to leach PCBs at less than 50 ppb, as measured by the TCLP, would be considered appropriate for disposal in a municipal
solid waste landfill, after written notice to the municipal solid waste landfill, or disposal could be at a TSCA approved
disposal facility. The treated PCB remediation waste would still be subject to all prohibitions in the PCB rules including,
but not limited to, use, reuse, export, or the proposed ban on open burning. One commenter to the ANPRM proposed that
EPA use the American National Standards Institute/American Nuclear Society leachability test (ANSI/ANS 16.1)
to determine the effectiveness of microencapsulation or vitrification technologies. The major technical differences
between the two leaching procedures are the amount of surface area exposed to the leaching medium and the neutral (versus
the TCLP's mildly acidic) nature of the leaching medium in the ANSI/ANS Standard. As stated in its introduction, the
ANSI/ANS standard serves only as a basis for indexing releases from the encapsulant and does not apply to any specific
environmental situation. The commenter noted that a variety of contaminant release tests and test conditions should
be developed to assess the potential for release of specific contaminants in given situations. Since this proposal
is focused on the release of a toxic constituent from a matrix when co-disposed with other solid waste in a municipal
solid waste landfill, EPA believes that the question of which test to use is more properly addressed in the solid and
hazardous waste regulations under RCRA than the PCB rules under TSCA. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Today's proposed self-implementing option for disposal of PCB remediation waste includes a different way to evaluate
PCB concentrations during site remediation. Some field screening tests have been developed and approved for use
under EPA's ``Test Methods for Evaluating Solid Waste'' (SW&hyph;846) and have otherwise been widely used. Chemicals
other than PCBs at the remediation site may interfere with the tests and indicate that PCBs are not present when in fact
PCBs are present (a false negative). The correct application of the tests may still not inform or warn the user of the
presence of such interferences. This proposal includes the use of several kinds of PCB field screening tests during
remediation, so long as confirmatory sampling is used to guard against false negatives and to demonstrate the absence
of interferences which would render the analytical results invalid. The ability to obtain acceptable analytical
results in a very short time on-site and while remediation is under way can complete remediation goals more quickly
and at lower costs. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The self-implementing option for the disposal of PCB remediation waste would offer one new consideration for PCB
disposal at 761.61(a)(4)(v): allowing non-liquid wastes generated by the cleanup process (e.g., spent abrasives)
to be disposed of at their existing concentration (i.e, at a concentration less than the maximum concentration of
PCBs found at the remediation waste site). Solvents used in remediation activities could be reused according to provisions
proposed in 761.79(a)(1) and 761.61(a). During use of the solvents, secondary containment would have to be provided
to ensure no solvent releases to soil or water. A general requirement for protection for workers engaged in decontamination
activities is also proposed. Decontamination activities could not proceed until those workers conducting the decontamination
are protected from exposure to PCBs and the materials used to decontaminate. EPA requests comments on this proposal
and technical information on the performance and effectiveness of other treatment technologies the Agency could
include in the self-implementing option.

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
 Performance-based option.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 The performance-based disposal option proposed at 761.61(b) includes the traditional disposal technologies of
high-temperature incineration, high efficiency boilers, chemical waste landfills, and alternate destruction
methodologies that are currently approved by the Director of the EPA Chemical Management Division for mobile, transportable,
and non-unique fixed-site disposal units, and by the Regional Administrator for unique fixed-site disposal units.
These technologies are based on their performance as required in the existing PCB disposal regulations. No specific
changes are being proposed for these standards. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
iii.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
 Risk-based option.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 The risk-based remediation option proposed at 761.61(c) bases disposal requirements for PCB remediation waste
on the potential risks to health and the environment resulting from residual PCBs in the PCB-remediation waste. Performance
requirements could include destruction, containment, restriction of access to the disposal site, deed restrictions,
and other short- and long-term management controls. The risk-based disposal standard would continue to be one of
no unreasonable risk of injury to health and the environment. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The application and approval process for a risk-based remediation approval would be essentially the same as the current
process for application for a performance-based PCB disposal approval. New approvals would be classified as performance-risk
based approvals under proposed 761.61(c). Written applications would be required and the approving official (i.e.,
the Regional Administrator having jurisdiction over the site of remediation) would document in the approval: the
reasons for the approval, the approval conditions, and EPA's findings. The process, criteria, and standards for
decision-making would be similar to EPA's site remediation program under CERCLA. It is EPA's desire to limit the use
of this time consuming and resource intensive proposed option in favor of the self-implementing provisions proposed
in 761.61(a) or the decontamination procedures proposed as additions to 761.79. To assist the applicant in developing
an approach for the risk-based disposal application, EPA's general principles for reviewing a PCB remediation approval
application are stated here in the form of four preferences. The first preference would be to have a permanent remedy
that allows for the least restrictive access and land use restrictions at each site. The second preference would be
to impose greater protection of sensitive ecosystems such as water resources, croplands, grazing lands, and residential
areas than the target standards, expressed as cleanup levels in the self-implementing option (at proposed 761.61(a)),
would provide. The third preference would be for destruction or extraction instead of land disposal. The fourth preference
would be for using on-site or existing off-site disposal facilities versus developing new off-site land disposal
facilities. Microencapsulation or vitrification would not be a preferred technology for PCBs if it caused unacceptable
increases in the overall volume of wastes being sent off-site to chemical waste landfills, resulted in a liquid phase,
or allowed unacceptable levels of leaching of PCBs. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The evaluation criteria for site-specific variances from the target standards would include: (1) Risk factors associated
with the waste (e.g., volume, concentration, physical state, toxicity, mobility), and (2) risk factors associated
with the proposed waste management option (e.g., safety, reliability, effectiveness, possibility of discharge
to surface or ground water, current and reasonably expected future site use, technical feasibility, resource value,
proposed institutional controls, permanence of remedy, potential for concentration of PCBs and waste minimization).
While this paragraph reflects some factors associated with each criterion, these unranked factors would only provide
notice and assistance in defining the criterion. EPA would not be limiting itself to the factors listed or require
that each factor listed be considered.

 Currently, based on the results of site sampling, historical, or other data, EPA may presume that PCBs are illegally
disposed of at a site and require remediation under TSCA. In that case, the burden is on the site owner or operator to
establish, through persuasive evidence, that the PCBs are not illegally disposed of under TSCA. Today, EPA proposes
to address all PCB remediation waste, regardless of concentration, physical state or date of disposal (see proposed
introductory text at 761.60) under 761.61, based on the risk of exposure or injury they now pose. EPA would apply the
current ``anti-dilution'' provision at 761.1(b) to retain regulatory authority over PCB remediation waste even
where the PCB concentration is now below 50 ppm, unless the dilution was authorized (e.g., as the result of a transformer
reclassification under 761.30(a)(2)(v)) and the authorized dilution occurred prior to disposal. Anti-dilution
would not mandate disposal requirements for PCB remediation waste under proposed 761.61 (or 761.62 for PCB non-remediation
waste). Again, the burden would be on the site owner or operator to establish, through persuasive evidence, that the
PCB remediation wastes, regardless of current concentration or date of disposal are legally disposed of under TSCA
and in the case of wastes disposed of before April 18, 1978, which are now 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=6 f=2 -->
;
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
50 ppm PCBs, do not pose a risk of injury. PCBs at any concentration are subject to remediation under CERCLA or corrective
action under RCRA. This is not an inconsistency in application of the various statutes because the 50 ppm PCB level
under TSCA is based in part on the economic impacts of the PCB regulations and not solely on risk. EPA is not precluded
from taking action under any other statute it administers simply because it has chosen not to regulate use or disposal
or take remedial action under TSCA. For example, a party begins a cleanup of a historic pre-1978 spill. This site would
not fall under 40 CFR part 761, subpart G and would require Regional approval for cleanup levels for PCBs at 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=6 f=2 -->
;
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
50 ppm. The soil at the site is found to vary in concentration between 10 ppm and 100 ppm PCBs. Upon application to the
Regional Administrator, under proposed 761.61(c), the site could be cleaned to a specified level, and the resulting
PCB remediation waste treated by chemical dechlorination. Or, under the proposal, the Regional Administrator could,
upon application and upon a site-specific evaluation, determine that an immobilizing procedure such as 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
in situ
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 vitrification was a viable alternative. A disposal application would then be judged by EPA on its overall ability
to protect health and the environment from unreasonable risk of injury from PCBs. PCBs at levels 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=6 f=2 -->
&lt;
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
50 ppm (at a pre-1978 disposal) would still be subject to cleanup under RCRA and CERCLA authorities. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The disposal rule proposed today would be a potentially ``applicable or relevant and appropriate requirement''
for PCB cleanups under the CERCLA, both with respect to the disposal of PCB remediation wastes at CERCLA sites, and
with respect to the remediation approach utilized and the residual level of PCBs in soil. However, EPA does not anticipate
that the provisions relating to the remedial approach and residual levels permitted will significantly affect CERCLA
cleanups, because the rule would provide three options. Generally, EPA would be likely to select the risk-based option
at 761.61(c), which would give the Agency very broad discretion in selecting a remedy. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
One commenter suggested that EPA should conduct a comparative risk analysis of all possible disposal techniques
and include other factors such as transportation and disposal of treatment residues before issuing a PCB disposal
approval under TSCA. EPA does not believe that TSCA authority should be used to accomplish exactly what CERCLA, an
all encompassing proactive remediation statute, was designed to do. Rather, the PCB disposal approval process under
TSCA is simply one of determining the effectiveness of an applicant's proposed cleanup and disposal options for PCBs
in achieving a specific standard.

 One category of large volume PCB wastes includes all contaminated environmental media, dredged materials, municipal
sewage treatment sludges, commercial or industrial sludges in or from any pollution control device (contaminated
as the result of a spill of PCBs but not resulting from the incidental manufacture of PCBs); soil, rags, and other debris
generated as the result of a spill cleanup; and site removal, remediation, or corrective action waste at any concentration
of PCBs and in liquid or non-liquid form. This category of wastes would be referred to as ``PCB remediation wastes,''
and EPA is proposing this definition at 761.3. In response to comments and to simplify the application of these amendments,
EPA is proposing that PCB remediation wastes include both liquids and non-liquids at any concentration of PCBs, in
any quantity or volume, regardless of when the waste was generated. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
 PCB non-remediation wastes.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 The other category of large volume PCB wastes would be referred to as ``PCB non-remediation wastes.'' PCB non-remediation
waste includes: non-liquid bulk wastes or debris from the demolition of buildings and other human created structures
where the construction materials were manufactured or coated (e.g., by using paint containing PCBs) with PCBs as
opposed to being contaminated with PCBs (e.g., through a spill from electrical equipment); wastes from the chopping
or shredding of automobiles, household and industrial appliances, or other white goods (i.e., shredder fluff);
PCB-impregnated electrical, sound-deadening, or other types of insulation and gaskets; and all other PCB Items
or PCBs for which disposal requirements are not otherwise specified in 761.60, regardless of concentration where
the concentration at the time of disposal was greater than or equal to 50 ppm PCBs. EPA is proposing a definition of ``PCB
non-remediation waste'' at 761.3. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Shredder wastes comprise small pieces of metal, rubber, plastic, fabric, foam, insulation, wire, cardboard, dirt,
and various other materials. Demolition wastes may contain any number of materials, including some of the same materials
found in shredder waste. The results of shredding or demolition processes may be that the sources of PCB contamination
in these large volume wastes may not easily be identified. In addition, some decommissioning projects and demolition
projects may produce large quantities of insulation containing PCBs. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Shredder waste is also the ``end of the line'' for many items, not otherwise regulated for disposal, that find their
way into the scrap metal stream, and may result in subsequent contamination of shredder waste. EPA acknowledges the
need for responsibly operated metal recycling facilities. As such, EPA is reiterating that all wastes containing
50 ppm PCBs or greater, including shredder wastes, as well as demolition wastes and large volumes of other PCB non-remediation
wastes impregnated with PCBs (e.g., insulation), are regulated for disposal. However, EPA is proposing at 761.62
that where PCB non-remediation wastes are the result of processing PCBs regulated for disposal, the wastes resulting
from that processing are also regulated for disposal even when the resulting concentration of the processing wastes
is less than 50 ppm PCB, through action of the anti-dilution provision at 761.1(b). Where the waste is already shredded,
statistically valid sampling and analytical methods acceptable to EPA, such as those in proposed Appendix III to
part 761, may be used to characterize the contamination to support proposals for various disposal options. Under
the TSCA PCB program, EPA will not accept any sampling method that mathematically masks or dilutes areas of PCB contamination.
A generator or facility owner or operator may demonstrate that no PCBs greater than or equal to 50 ppm were in the wastestream
at the time of generation or that all wastes containing PCBs are exempt under the TSCA Household Waste Exemption (Unit
II.D.1. in this preamble). Conscientious operators of demolition activities and shredding facilities should be
aware of known sources of contamination that can readily be removed from the wastestream before processing and disposal.
These sources may include small capacitors, light ballasts, or PCB-Contaminated Articles such as hydraulic equipment.
Proposed 761.62 would allow for other disposal options for PCB non-remediation wastes based on site-specific criteria
by extending the risk-based philosophy of the disposal requirements for municipal sludges and dredged materials
under proposed 761.60(a)(5). Under this proposal, EPA could also require as a condition of any approval under this
section the implementation of a source identification and removal program to control the level (i.e., concentration)
and variability of PCBs in the wastestream. In compliance with current restrictions, items regulated for disposal
such as transformer carcasses, nonintact or leaking small capacitors, or wastes resulting from unauthorized uses
must not be placed in the metal stream destined for shredding facilities.

Risk-based disposal.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 In general, EPA's preference for disposal of PCB non-remediation wastes under proposed 761.62 is to approve their
disposal in a well-engineered and operated municipal solid waste landfill with appropriate monitoring to detect
releases of PCBs to the environment. Facilities should also be designed and operated in such a manner as to control
the release of PCB non-remediation wastes to the environment by controlling among other things, areal dispersion,
run-on and runoff, and leachate generation and management from the waste disposal units. EPA would not be inclined
to approve the disposal of PCB non-remediation wastes as fill material in environmentally sensitive areas including
but not limited to sites in 100&hyph;year flood plains, near potential sources of drinking water, in wellhead protection
areas, and in residential settings. PCB non-remediation wastes could still be disposed of under the three current
disposal options of incineration, chemical waste landfill, or any alternative disposal methods approved under
TSCA authorities by the Regional Administrator upon application. Under the proposal, if the waste is not uniform
in PCB contamination, the Regional Administrator may specify appropriate limitations on the method or location
of disposal (761.62(c)(4)). Where PCB non-remediation waste is stored on the ground (e.g., in a pile), any soil contaminated
with non-remediation waste would be regulated for disposal under 761.61.

 As an alternative to obtaining a risk-based TSCA disposal approval under proposed 761.62(c), EPA is proposing under
761.62(b), to allow the disposal of PCB non-remediation waste in a municipal solid waste landfill if the level of PCBs
in the waste as measured by the Toxicity Characteristic Leaching Procedure was less than 50 micrograms per liter (i.e.,
50 ppb) and the landfill is notified in writing, at least 15 working days prior to their receipt of the waste. This self-implementing
option would be available to only the PCB non-remediation waste itself and not to any material resulting from pre-treatment
such as microencapsulation or vitrification of the waste. Any proposal to process (i.e., pretreat) PCB non-remediation
waste currently requires an approval, and this is not proposed to change. Disposal of PCB non-remediation wastes,
such as wastes from automobile or appliance shredders, in a municipal solid waste landfill is currently prohibited
by the PCB regulations, but may be allowed by EPA on a case-by-case basis. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
EPA requests comment, with supporting data, on the inclusion of other self-implementing options for the storage
and disposal of PCB non-remediation wastes under 761.62(b). These additional options would include provisions
to make them generally applicable nationwide and not require additional site-specific prohibitions or limitations.

 Performance-based disposal.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 PCB non-remediation waste could still be disposed of in a TSCA approved incinerator or chemical waste landfill under
proposed 761.62(a). This option would be most appropriate where the PCB for PCB non-remediation waste which was no
longer being generated, the waste could not be disposed of under proposed 761.62(b) because of high levels of leachable
PCBs, and where the situation would not warrant the expenditure of resources to apply for a risk-based disposal approval
under proposed 761.62(c).

 Decontamination standards and procedures.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 EPA is proposing several changes and additions to 761.79 with general applicability throughout the PCB program under
TSCA, for liquids and non-porous surfaces, except where another standard is established, for example in a RCRA permit,
a TSCA PCB disposal approval, a Superfund ROD, or a Superfund enforcement decision document. Today's proposal includes
a general decontamination standard of 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=6 f=2 -->
:
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 10 micrograms PCBs (

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=1 -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
) (as measured by standard wipe tests, 761.123) for a non-porous surface (see proposed definition at 761.3) and two
decontamination procedures for non-porous surfaces. The decontamination standard may be achieved using any disposal
or cleaning technique which, in some instances, may require prior approval by EPA. Although activities such as filtering,
soaking, wiping, stripping of insulation, chopping, scraping, or the use of abrasives to remove or separate PCBs
from contaminated surfaces or liquids may be processing for disposal as opposed to disposal, EPA is proposing to waive
any requirement to obtain prior approval under TSCA for these listed activities. EPA also considered whether to include
distillation in this exemption but remains concerned about releases of volatile and semi-volatile organic compounds
to the environment. EPA is seeking comment on the inclusion of distillation. All residues containing PCBs from these
and other ``disposal'' activities would remain regulated. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The proposed standard for decontamination of solid surfaces is the standard in the PCB Spill Cleanup Policy at 761.125(c)(2)(i).
EPA believes that 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=6 f=2 -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 is protective for disposal or subsequent reuse of the decontaminated surface. This standard has also been demonstrated
to EPA through the PCB disposal approval process to be achievable through a wide variety of techniques. The residual
cleaning materials containing PCBs would be managed and disposed of as a PCB waste in accordance with the applicable
PCB disposal regulations in part 761, subpart D. The ``Note'' currently following 761.79 would be inserted as introductory
text under 761.79 to warn those conducting decontamination operations that compliance with this section would not
relieve them of their duty to comply with other Federal, State, or local requirements for the use and disposal of solvents.
One example is the requirement to comply with the rules for the disposal of wastes identified or listed under RCRA or
State or local laws as solid, hazardous, or otherwise regulated wastes. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
As an alternative to decontamination followed by sampling, for non-porous surfaces, especially those that cannot
be accessed for sampling, EPA is proposing two non-aggressive procedures for decontamination. The first procedure
is for surfaces contaminated with mineral oil dielectric fluid (MODEF) with PCB concentrations 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=6 f=2 -->
:
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 10,000 ppm (see proposed 761.79(e)). The second procedure is for surfaces contaminated with higher concentrations
of PCBs in MODEF and askarel PCBs (see proposed 761.79(f)). Each procedure involves a 15&hyph;hour non-aggressive
soaking (i.e., no agitation of the kerosene or movement of the contaminated surface in the kerosene). Proposed 761.79(f)
would require a second soak with clean kerosene. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
After decontamination using one of these procedures, the decontaminated surface would not be regulated for disposal
and could be reused except in association with food, feed, or drinking water in accordance with proposed 761.20(c)(5).
EPA's research demonstrates that these two non-aggressive procedures using kerosene should decontaminate surfaces
to a level 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=6 f=2 -->
:
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=1 -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
. Therefore, confirmatory sampling would not be required. EPA is requesting comment, supported by laboratory data,
on aggressive versus the proposed non-aggressive decontamination techniques especially where the volume of kerosene
or another solvent proposed by the commenter can be reduced. EPA recognizes that there is a possibility that the proposed
decontamination procedure may not result in final surface levels at or below 10

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
, the surface would be regulated unless it could be shown by the owner (i.e., through laboratory documentation) that
the original PCB concentrations were determined, the prescribed procedures in 761.79(e) or (f) were followed for
those concentrations of PCBs, and the prescribed volume of PCB rinseate was used and properly disposed of (i.e., through
copies of the manifests and certificates of disposal). 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
EPA is also proposing additional language at 761.79(a) to clarify that the disposal of solvents, abrasives, or equipment
used in decontamination procedures is regulated and is proposing another disposal option, specifically disposal
in an industrial boiler, for certain of those solvents. The proposal would also require at 761.79(a)(5) that all decontamination
activities be conducted with containment adequate to prevent releases of PCBs to the environment. EPA is proposing
that any decontamination activities conducted in accordance with the provisions of 761.79 would not require a PCB
disposal approval from EPA. Workers would have to be protected against exposure through dermal contact or inhalation;
however, EPA is not specifying what measures must be taken. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The proposal establishes a decontamination standard for water of 0.5 micrograms PCB per liter (0.5 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=6 f=1 -->
m
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
g/l) or approximately 0.5 ppb PCB (see proposed 761.79(g)). This standard is consistent with EPA drinking water levels
for PCBs at 40 CFR 141.61(c). EPA is proposing a 0.5 ppb decontamination standard because it is difficult to ensure
that the decontaminated water will not be reused in association with food or feed or as drinking water for livestock
or humans. A conforming amendment at proposed 761.20(c)(6) would allow the unrestricted reuse of water decontaminated
in accordance with the level established in 761.79(g). The Agency believes that uses of water at or below the proposed
decontamination level would not pose an unreasonable risk of injury to health or the environment. The proposal also
establishes a decontamination standard for organic liquids, not associated with remediation wastes, of less than
2 milligrams PCB per liter (i.e., 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=6 f=2 -->
&lt;
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
2 ppm PCB) (see proposed 761.79(h)). 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
EPA believes that placing these standards in the decontamination section will clarify and simplify the implementation
of the PCB program by specifically defining levels for decontamination and removing the prohibitions against reuse
(see 761.20(c)(5) and (6)). The proposed introductory text to 761.60 states in part that ``...PCB wastes must be disposed
of in accordance with provisions of this subpart.'' EPA interprets this to mean that any PCB otherwise subject to the
disposal requirements of 761.60, may also be disposed of through decontamination under proposed 761.79.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
 Distribution in commerce and use of decontaminated equipment, structures, and materials
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
. The Agency is proposing a conforming amendment to the current provisions of 761.20(c) as an exception to the general
prohibition against the distribution in commerce and use of equipment, structures, and materials unless they are
decontaminated under a TSCA approval, or the provisions at proposed 761.79. This amendment is important because
it causes the scope of the PCB prohibitions in this section to, among other things, specifically conform to the current
use of TSCA disposal approvals in establishing decontamination or cleanup levels (see proposed 761.20(c)(4)).
EPA also proposes at 761.20(c)(7) to exempt from the general prohibition on use of PCBs, surfaces (e.g., equipment)
which comes in contact with PCBs or PCB wastes at 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=6 f=2 -->
;
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
50 ppm by allowing its continued use until thw surface exceeded the appropriate decontamination standard, at which
point it would have to be decontaminated or disposed of. The Agency believes that the further use, or distribution
in commerce of items decontaminated or cleaned up to specific standards established in applicable EPA PCB spill cleanup
policies, 761.79, or a TSCA approval would not present an unreasonable risk of injury if the decontaminated items
are not used or reused in association with food, feed, or drinking water. For water, a standard is being proposed at
761.20(c)(6) that is stringent enough to allow unrestricted distribution or reuse of the decontaminated water.
In 761.20(c)(7), the Agency is proposing to allow the restricted distribution or reuse of solid, nonporous surfaces
that have been contaminated by regulated PCBs if the final PCB concentration meets the decontamination standard
proposed at 761.79(d), regardless of the original concentration of the PCBs. Although any liquid (e.g., a solvent)
or solid (e.g., an abrasive) used for decontamination would remain regulated, the decontaminated surface could
be distributed or reused pursuant to proposed 761.20(c)(5) and (6).

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Processing for disposal
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
. Current 761.20(c)(2) says in part that PCBs ``may be processed . . . in compliance with the requirements of this part
for purposes of disposal in accordance with the requirements of 761.60.'' The preamble language addressing this
section (see 44 FR 31527, May 30, 1979) explained that the provision was intended to apply to the concentration of PCBs
in a manufacturing waste stream where the wastes resulted from the manufacture and processing of PCBs for use. EPA
is clarifying how this paragraph applies to the disposal of all PCBs, including those removed from use. Today, EPA
is broadening the exemption for processing for disposal by identifying which processing for disposal does not require
an approval and which processing for disposal does require a PCB disposal approval. EPA clarifies that processing
activities which are primarily associated with and facilitate the storage and transportation of PCBs for disposal
would not require an approval. Processing activities which are primarily associated with and facilitate treatment,
as defined in 261.10, or land disposal, rather than storage or transportation for disposal would require an approval
unless the processing was part of an activity already included in an approval or other authorization in subpart D of
this part, for example in 761.61(a), 761.62(b), or 761.79. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Specifically, EPA is implementing the existing provisions at 761.20(c)(2) as follows: 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(a) Processing activities which are primarily associated with and facilitate storage or transportation for disposal
do not require a TSCA PCB disposal approval. Examples include, but are not limited to removing PCBs from service (e.g.,
draining liquids), packaging or repackaging PCBs for transportation for disposal, or combining materials from
smaller containers into larger containers in accordance with 761.1(b).
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(b) Processing activities which are primarily associated with and facilitate treatment or land disposal require
an approval unless they are part of an existing approval or are part of a self-implementing activity such as 761.61(a)
and 761.79 or otherwise specifically allowed under 40 CFR part 761, subpart D. Examples include but not limited to
microencapsulation; pulverization; particle size separation; employing augers or hoppers to facilitate feeding
non-liquid PCBs into a disposal unit; and directly piping liquid PCBs into a disposal unit from PCB items, storage
containers or bulk transport vehicles; or directly introducing non-liquid PCBs from containers, bulk transport
vehicles or on pallets into a disposal unit, such as an incinerator, a high efficiency boiler, industrial furnace,
alternate destruction method, or chemical waste landfill. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(c) With the exception of provisions in 761.60(a)(2) or (3), in order to meet the intent of 761.1(b), processing, diluting
or otherwise blending of waste prior to being introduced into a disposal unit for purposes of meeting a PCB concentration
limit shall be included in a disposal approval or comply with the requirements of 761.79. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(d) The rate of delivering liquids or non-liquids into a PCB disposal unit shall be part of the conditions of the PCB
disposal approval for the unit when an approval is required.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Section 761.3 currently defines ``PCB Article'' as any manufactured article, other than a PCB Container, that contains
PCBs and whose surface(s) has been in direct contact with PCBs. ``PCB Article'' includes capacitors, transformers,
electric motors, pumps, pipes, and any other manufactured item (1) that is formed to a specific shape or design during
manufacture, (2) that has end use function(s) dependent in whole or in part upon its shape or design during end use,
and (3) that has either no change of chemical composition during its end use or only those changes of composition that
have no commercial purpose separate from that of the PCB Article. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The large volume article disposal proposals differ from the existing PCB Article disposal regulations in two ways:
they focus more on the presence of PCBs rather than on the presence of PCB containing liquids; and the proposed changes
focus more on the decontamination of portions of the articles for purposes of another use (metal recovery) or reuse
(by verifying the absence of PCBs presumed present), rather than for outright disposal (i.e., destruction or landfilling)
of the article.

Disposal.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 The current 761.60(b)(5) would be redesignated as 761.60(b)(6). The new 761.60(b)(6)(ii) would be amended to include
language allowing disposal in industrial furnaces (as defined in the proposed 761.3) of drained PCB-Contaminated
Articles. A new 761.60(b)(6)(iii) would be added to address PCB Articles with surfaces contaminated with PCBs, but
which contain no liquids by which to characterize the article. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
With respect to 761.60(b)(6)(ii), although not explicitly provided for in the current regulations, EPA in the past,
has interpreted disposal in an industrial furnace, as defined in proposed 761.3, as an appropriate method of disposal
also for drained PCB-Contaminated Transformers and drained PCB-Contaminated natural gas pipeline (see Ref. 25).

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Currently, the regulations specifically state that ``salvage'' is an acceptable form of disposal for ``PCB hydraulic
machines'' containing PCBs at concentrations of 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=6 f=2 -->
;
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
50 ppm (761.60(b)(3)). The word ``salvage'' has been interpreted by EPA to allow smelting of ``PCB hydraulic machines''
that have been drained of all free flowing liquid. (See Ref. 21) In addition to disposal of hydraulic machines, which
have been drained of hydraulic fluids, in municipal or industrial landfills, EPA is proposing to amend 761.60(b)(3)
to allow salvage by disposal in industrial furnaces, as defined in proposed 761.3. It should be noted that PCBs, not
just free flowing liquids, associated with the PCB Articles must be removed from the surface of the item before the
item may be reintroduced into commerce. EPA is seeking comments and data on disposal techniques such as disposal in
industrial furnaces for inclusion in this amendment. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The new 761.60(b)(6)(iii) addresses PCB Articles with surfaces contaminated with PCBs, but which contain no liquids
by which to characterize the article. This category of PCB Articles would include, but not be limited to, ship hulls,
air handling systems, and other articles that could be characterized by a wipe sample. As a point of clarification,
EPA believes that PCB-Contaminated Electrical Equipment with porous material in its core will probably not rapidly
be able to meet the requirement of being drained, because the porous core will continue to release liquid for an extended
period of time after the initial liquid is drained from the unit. In these cases EPA recommends that the core and any
other sorbent material be removed and placed in a TSCA approved chemical waste landfill. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
PCB-Contaminated Articles regulated under proposed 761.60(b)(6)(ii) or (iii) would be required to be disposed
of in: a facility permitted, licensed, or registered by a State to manage municipal or industrial solid waste (excluding
thermal treatment units), an industrial furnace (defined in proposed 761.3) operating in compliance with the requirements
of 761.60(a)(4), or other TSCA approved disposal facilities. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
As a point of clarification, the phrase ``is not regulated for disposal'' at current 761.60(b)(4) and (b)(5)(ii)
does not mean that drained PCB-Contaminated Electrical Equipment and PCB Articles may be sold, distributed in commerce
for sale or use, or reused without an exemption under these rules. The phrase only means that a waste can be disposed
of, in accordance with the definition of disposal at 761.3, without a TSCA PCB approval.

 Open burning and industrial furnaces.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 Currently, 761.60(b)(4) and (b)(5)(ii) provide that drained PCB-Contaminated Electrical Equipment (except capacitors)
and drained PCB-Contaminated Articles are not regulated for disposal. EPA chose not to regulate the disposal of certain
PCBs because it found that the risks were not unreasonable. However, EPA is aware that certain PCBs have been disposed
of through ``open burning'' (e.g., the burn-out of core materials in PCB-Contaminated Transformers) without adequate
provision for efficient combustion and control of gaseous combustion products. EPA currently controls the combustion
of PCBs through incinerator and industrial boiler criteria set out at 761.70, to limit the release of PCBs and the production
or release of byproducts of the incomplete combustion of PCBs such as dioxins and furans. EPA is proposing at 761.3
a definition of ``open burning'' that is consistent with RCRA's definition at 40 CFR 260.10, a ban on the practice of
open burning. Open burning can result in the volatilization of PCBs and several toxic products of incomplete combustion
including polychlorinated dibenzofurans; 2,3,7,8-tetrachlorodibenzofuran; polychlorinated dibenzo-
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
-dioxin. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
This provision would prevent open burning of regulated PCBs in State permitted, licensed, or registered municipal
solid waste combustors (i.e., thermal treatment unit) unless the combustor met the requirements for an industrial
furnace set out at proposed 761.3 and 761.60(a)(4). To facilitate the Regional Administrator's review of the operation
of an industrial furnace, a site-specific risk assessment would need to accompany any request for a Regional Administrator's
determination of no unreasonable risk. This risk assessment could be in the form of a permit issued under RCRA or the
Clean Air Act, or as a separate determination issued by the Regional Administrator prior to combustion of PCBs. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Industrial furnaces, as defined in 40 CFR 260.10, are being proposed as an acceptable form of disposal when as industrial
furnace combusting PCBs does not release unreasonable levels of PCBs to the environment. To help ensure that PCBs
disposed of in an industrial furnace do not pose an unreasonable risk of injury to health or the environment, EPA is
proposing at 761.60(a)(4) that industrial furnaces used for disposal of PCBs be operated under either a RCRA permit
(40 CFR part 266, subpart H and 40 CFR 270.66) for industrial furnaces or a valid State air permit that includes a standard
for PCBs, and that the industrial furnaces be in compliance with the conditions of their permit. Where an industrial
furnace does not meet the permit requirements, upon written request by the owner or operator of the industrial furnace,
the Regional Administrator may make a finding, in writing, that the combustion of PCBs in certain industrial furnaces
would not pose an unreasonable risk to health or the environment if the industrial furnace is operating in compliance
with the proposed conditions discussed below even though it does not have RCRA or State air permits. EPA is amending
Form 7710&hyph;53, ``Notification of PCB Activity,'' to include a category for industrial furnaces and is proposing
that owners of this equipment comply with the notification requirements of 761.205 by notifying the Agency that their
equipment is used to dispose of PCBs. (For the reader's convenience, a copy of the revised form is reproduced at unit
III.J. of this preamble and may be used to notify EPA of PCB waste handling activities. The form will nolonger be shown
in 40 CFR part 761.) 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The following operating conditions are being proposed at 761.60(a)(4) for industrial furnaces disposing of PCB-Contaminated
Items. The conditions are: (1) The operating temperature of the industrial furnace must be at least 1,000
<!-- PJG 0017 degreeslatlong -->
&cir; C (centigrade) at the time it is charged; (2) each charge must be fed into molten metal or metal at or above 1,000
<!-- PJG 0017 degreeslatlong -->
&cir; C; (3) successive charges must not be introduced into the hearth in less than 15 minute intervals, (4) there shall
be no visible particulate emissions from the stack during PCB disposal (as determined by Method 9 in 40 CFR part 60 Appendix
A), (5) there shall be no visible fugitive particulate emissions from the industrial furnace building during PCB
disposal (as determined by Method 9, in 40 CFR part 60 Appendix A); (6) the industrial furnace must have an operational
device which accurately measures, directly or indirectly, the temperature in the hearth; and (7) a reading of the
temperature in the hearth at the time it is charged must be taken, recorded, and retained at the facility for 3 years
from the date each charge is introduced. If EPA ever determined that an industrial furnace was not operating in compliance
with one or more of the conditions proposed in 761.60(a)(4), was not operating under and in compliance with a valid
RCRA permit or State air permit (with an emissions standard for PCBs) or a finding by the Regional Administrator, the
owner or operator of that industrial furnace would be deemed to be conducting ``open burning'', and would be, among
other things, prohibited from introducing any additional PCB wastes into the unit. Examples of acceptable industrial
furnaces which could meet the proposed operating conditions include, but are not limited to, electric arc furnaces,
blast furnaces, and open hearth furnaces. If drained PCB-Contaminated Items are charged at less than 1,000

&cir; C into a furnace chamber and the furnace gas emissions from this chamber passed through a secondary combustion
chamber, this kind of furnace shall be approved according to 761.60(e). This disposal option would not be available
for TSCA regulated PCB liquids. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
As a conforming change, due to the proposed ban on open burning, EPA is proposing to delete the phrase ``is not regulated
by this rule'' from the PCB regulations at 761.60(b)(4), governing disposal of drained PCB-Contaminated Electrical
Equipment, except capacitors and (b)(5), governing disposal of drained PCB-Contaminated Articles. The proposal
would substitute the phrase ``may be disposed of in a facility permitted, licensed, or registered by a State to manage
municipal or industrial solid waste (excluding thermal treatment units), an industrial furnace as defined in 761.3,
operating in compliance with the requirements of  761.60(a)(4), or a disposal facility approved under this part.''
The purpose of these proposals is to promote, with minimal regulatory burden, certain recycling practices such as
smelting for the recovery of metals and to stop such practices as the unapproved burning of PCB liquids, contaminated
wood or paper cores, or contaminated insulation even where there may be a claim of energy recovery unless specifically
allowed elsewhere by these regulations. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Some commenters to the ANPRM advised EPA against proposing controls on industrial furnaces, stating that current
processes were adequate. However, another group of commenters recommended that either additional controls be placed
on industrial furnaces or that drained PCB-Contaminated Items be otherwise regulated for disposal. These commenters
suggested environmental harm could be caused by the unregulated combustion of PCB-Contaminated Items. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
EPA believes that responsibly run industrial furnaces provide a valuable recycling benefit and that the current
Federal regulatory matrix in conjunction with the proposed operating standards would provide adequate controls
on any potential emissions.

 Characterization of PCB Articles.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 Under 761.60(b)(5) of the current rules, PCB Articles are characterized by the PCB concentration found in the free
flowing liquid. This method is appropriate for electrical equipment containing PCBs and some other articles containing
PCBs. However, it may not be appropriate for PCB Articles whose surfaces may be contaminated with a very light coating
of liquid which is not free flowing. In these instances, EPA is proposing at 761.60(b)(6) that the standard wipe test
be used to characterize these articles. Nonporous surfaces including, but not limited to, ship hulls and air handling
systems could be wipe sampled under proposed 761.60(b)(6)(iii), pursuant to the wipe sampling guidelines, at locations
that accurately characterize the article. Areas directly in contact with PCBs would have to be sampled. Any nonporous
surface found to be contaminated with PCBs at

100 micrograms per 100 square centimeters must be disposed of in a TSCA approved incinerator or placed in a TSCA approved
chemical waste landfill. EPA is proposing to limit the application of the wipe test to characterize items for disposal
to certain articles. The wiped surface must be non-porous for the test to accurately characterize the contamination
level of the article. However, a standard wipe test may be applicable to other PCB Articles with porous surfaces under
an alternative disposal approval (761.60(e)). Any article may also be disposed of through decontamination under
proposed 761.79, as applicable.

 Characterization of natural gas pipeline.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 A new 761.60(b)(5) and Appendix I would be created to address disposal, including abandonment in place, and removal
of natural gas pipeline. This section proposes the characterization of natural gas pipeline by direct analysis of
pipeline fluids, commonly found in pipeline ``drips'' and geographic low points or the use of the standard wipe test
for characterization purposes, if liquid samples are not available. Natural gas pipeline being removed from service
which is characterized as PCB-Contaminated, that is, between 50 and less than 500 ppm PCBs in pipeline fluids or, for
drained pipe, those segments which are greater than 10 to less than 100 micrograms PCB per 100 square centimeters,
as characterized by the standard wipe test, may be disposed of in a facility which is permitted, licensed, or registered
by a State to manage municipal or industrial solid waste (except thermal treatment units), in an industrial furnace
operating in compliance with the requirements of 761.60(a)(4), or in a TSCA approved disposal facility. Natural
gas pipeline characterized at 500 ppm PCB or greater in its condensate liquids or 100

 PCB or greater in a standard wipe sample could be removed and managed in a TSCA approved disposal facility, as a PCB non-remediation
waste under proposed 761.62 or decontaminated under proposed 761.79. Natural gas pipeline with an inside diameter
of 4 inches or less is proposed to be disposed of in the same manner as PCB-Contaminated pipeline. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The natural gas pipeline industry routinely takes segments of pipeline out of service by abandoning the segments
in the right-of-way. EPA is proposing several options for natural gas pipeline that would be abandoned in place. Natural
gas pipeline at any concentration of PCBs, containing no free-flowing liquid and with an inside diameter of 4 inches
or less, could be abandoned in place by filling the pipe to 50 percent of the volume with cement or other materials listed
in proposed 761.60(b)(5) or placing the abandoned segment in a public service notification program and under either
option, sealing the ends shut. PCB-Contaminated natural gas pipeline of any diameter could be abandoned in place
if it contained no free flowing liquids and each end was sealed shut. Natural gas pipeline at concentrations of 500
ppm PCBs or greater, or 100

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 PCBs or greater could be abandoned in place if it was either washed once with diesel fuel or filled to 50 percent of its
volume with cement or other materials listed in proposed 761.60(b)(5) and, in either case, each end was sealed. Where
natural gas pipeline of any diameter or PCB concentration is abandoned in certain listed locations that could be difficult
to sample, the segments would be filled to 50 percent with cement or other materials listed in proposed 761.60(b)(5),
unless cement was specified as a requirement for abandonment. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
EPA proposes, in Appendix I, details on how to characterize natural gas pipelines containing PCBs for abandonment
and removal. Appendix I would require that natural gas pipeline containing PCBs be wiped on the lowest point on the
inside surface of each end of a removed segment of pipe as that point would be determined prior to removal from the ground.
Where the pipe was removed from the ground, the removed segment to be sampled could not exceed 40 feet in length. Segments
of natural gas pipe removed from the ground for disposal would be required to be sampled at each end. A length of pipe
having seven or fewer segments that was removed for disposal would have to be sampled at each end of each segment. For
removal of multiple contiguous segments, greater than seven segments but less than 3 miles in total length, samples
would be required from both ends of the first and last segments removed and both ends of five randomly chosen segments
in between (with this scheme producing seven sampled segments). For removal of multiple contiguous segments more
than 3 miles in total length, samples would be required from both ends of the first segment and both ends of each segment
that is one-half mile distant from the segment previously sampled (with this scheme producing a minimum of seven sampled
segments). 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
For pipe to be disposed of, the analytical results of both samples from each segment sampled would be averaged to determine
the level of contamination. If any average sample results from any segment removed were greater than 10 to less than
100 micrograms PCB/100 square centimeters, then that segment would be considered PCB-Contaminated. If any average
sample results from multiple contiguous segments removed were greater than 10 micrograms PCB/100 square centimeters
then all unsampled segments in that removal would be presumed to be contaminated with PCBs at that level. Other sampling
regimes could be approved in a disposal approval issued under 761.60(e) or 761.62(c).

The Agency solicited through the ANPRM information and comments regarding the regulation under TSCA of the continued
use, storage, and disposal of mixtures, items, and wastes with both PCB and radioactive constituents. Information
was requested to be used to propose criteria for developing an authorization for the continued use, storage, and disposal
of such materials, which would minimize risks to health and the environment from PCBs. With respect to radioactive
components, the proposed criteria would achieve compliance with requirements established under the authority
of the Atomic Energy Act (AEA) as amended (42 U.S.C. 2011) and maintain doses from radioactive materials regulated
under the AEA at a level that is ``As Low As Reasonably Achievable'' (ALARA) (40 FR 19442, May 5, 1975; 10 CFR part 50,
Appendix I). 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Nuclear Regulatory Commission (NRC) and the Department of Energy (DOE) participated in the identification of
situations of potential concern due to the presence of radionuclides and the development of the proposed waste management
options for PCB/radioactive waste, as reflected in this section. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The ANPRM stated that neither TSCA nor the PCB regulations has waiver provisions similar to those under RCRA and solicited
comments on amending the 1&hyph;year time limit for storage and disposal for PCBs at 40 CFR 761.65(a) where no disposal
technology exists. An extension to the 1&hyph;year storage and disposal requirement could also be appropriate for
situations where the disposal capacity or the time necessary to complete the disposal are insufficient. This approach
would provide flexibility on a case-by-case basis to address specific use scenarios or storage requirements and
issues unique to PCB/radioactive waste management. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The majority of comments supported flexibility in extending the 1&hyph;year time limit for storage and disposal,
and concurred with the proposal that such extensions or waivers should be determined on a case-by-case basis. Some
commenters suggested a general regulatory waiver or variance to the 1&hyph;year time limit for storage and disposal
requirement. Still another commenter suggested that EPA grant an exemption similar to the national capacity variance
to RCRA's hazardous waste land disposal restriction requirements. Other commenters proposed a ``good faith'' showing
by contacting disposal facilities nationwide and certifying that disposal capacity is not available for wastes
remaining in storage. Many commenters also supported extending or waiving the 1&hyph;year time limit for storage
and disposal requirement for materials like PCB/radioactive waste. Commenters recommended extensions for problems
such as: a lack of disposal or treatment technology, a lack of disposal or treatment capacity, and a lack of sufficient
time to complete the disposal process (e.g., bioremediation). 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
EPA, in Unit III.G.3 of this preamble, is proposing to amend 40 CFR 761.65 to allow for self-implementing and case-by-case
extensions to the 1&hyph;year time limit for storage and disposal requirement for any PCB wastes. PCB/radioactive
wastes are included in that proposal. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Proposed 761.65(a)(2) would provide the Regional Administrator for the Region where the waste is being stored, or
the Director, Chemical Management Division (CMD), authority to grant extensions to the current 1&hyph;year time
limit for storage and disposal of PCBs, including PCB/radioactive wastes. An extension could be granted based on
a determination by the Regional Administrator or the Director, CMD, that there was a demonstrated need or justification
to store or conduct disposal of wastes beyond 1 year and that no unreasonable risks of injury to health or the environment
would result from an extension of the storage period. Criteria for extension would include, but not be limited to,
a demonstrated need to store wastes beyond the 1&hyph;year time frame due to a lack of disposal capacity, the absence
of a treatment technology or insufficient time to complete the treatment/destruction process, and a demonstration
that relevant treatment or disposal requirements are being pursued. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The problem of capacity shortfalls is expected to continue for some time after the disposal technology has been developed
because of the large volume of stored PCB/radioactive wastes awaiting disposal. As an example of capacity problems,
DOE operates a Regional disposal facility at Oak Ridge, Tennessee, for PCB/RCRA/radioactive mixed wastes. Fifty
million pounds of wastes are currently in storage for disposal at several Regional sites. Current generation rates
at the various facilities that rely on Oak Ridge for disposal are approximately 5 million pounds per year. The maximum
disposal rate for the unit is approximately 3.09 million pounds per year. Current projections indicate that it will
take 30 to 50 years to dispose of the current materials in storage and all the wastes yet to be generated using the facility
as currently configured (Ref. 11). Therefore, DOE is not expected to meet the 1&hyph;year time limit for storage and
disposal requirement even though it is pursuing additional capacity. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Several commenters requested that under TSCA, the PCB and radioactive wastes in a mixture not be confused with the
term ``mixed wastes'' under RCRA. EPA agrees and proposes to apply the term ``PCB/radioactive wastes'' or ``PCB/fissionable
radioactive waste'' (See proposed definition at 761.3) as opposed to ``mixed wastes'' to wastes containing PCBs
and radioactive constituents subject to regulation under TSCA and the AEA. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
EPA disagrees with those cementers indicating that there is no disposal technology approved under TSCA for PCB/radioactive
waste. Incineration technology is available; however, there is no commercial disposal capacity and only limited
disposal capacity for incineration of PCB/radioactive waste 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(e.g., the DOE incinerator at Oak Ridge, TN). Therefore, facilities storing PCB/radioactive waste often cannot
comply with the 1&hyph;year time limit for storage and disposal because insufficient disposal capacity exists.
Until additional disposal capacity becomes available, PCB/radioactive wastes will require storage, generally
exceeding the 1&hyph;year time limit for storage and disposal for PCBs. Even as capacity increases, there will still
be requests for extensions of the 1&hyph;year time limit for storage and disposal because of the sheer volume of materials
in storage. Therefore, EPA is not proposing to place a specific time limit on the extension to the 1&hyph;year time
limit for storage and disposal. Recipients of an extension to the 1&hyph;year time limit for storage and disposal
would have to request, if needed, and receive from the Regional Administrator or Director, CMD periodic renewals
to their original extension. It is possible that the same reasons that apply to an original extension request may apply
to any subsequent requests because no progress in developing a disposal technology has occurred. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
One commenter stated that annual status reports for PCB/radioactive wastes in storage for disposal should be required
and updated annually on July 15 to coincide with the submission of the PCB Annual Report for each facility. Status reports
or reviews of existing extensions may be conditions established by the Regional Administrator or Director, CMD providing
the extension. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Several commenters suggested that EPA amend 761.65 to accommodate concerns relating to management and storage and
the uniqueness of PCB/radioactive wastes. There are certain elements relating to storage of radioactive wastes
containing plutonium or enriched uranium that require consideration of criticality safety (i.e., the prevention
of nuclear reactions that would pose a threat to health and the environment). All actions relating to criticality
or radiation protection issues must be coordinated through, and approved by, the local office of the regulatory authority
for radioactive material regulation; for licensed nuclear facilities, this would be the appropriate NRC Regional
Office or State radiation protection authority office. The issue of criticality relates to proper storage of fissionable
materials so that a continuous self-sustaining chain reaction does not occur. [DOE Order 5480.5 states that ``nuclear
criticality is a self sustaining chain reaction, i.e., the state in which the effective neutron multiplication constant
of a system of fissionable material equals or exceeds unity.''] Proper storage of fissionable material is essential
to avoid a criticality event. A self-sustaining chain reaction (i.e., criticality) will not result in an atomic explosion.
However, it can result in the generation of harmful radiation that can cause death or serious injury (Ref. 54). 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The issue of criticality relates to the types of containers used to store the fissionable materials or suspect fissionable
materials and the storage area. EPA is proposing to amend 761.65(c)(6) by allowing an alternative to the container
requirements approved by the Department of Transportation (DOT) for PCB/fissionable radioactive wastes. Containers
used to store liquid PCB/fissionable radioactive wastes would have to be nonleaking. Containers used to store both
liquid and non-liquid PCB/fissionable radioactive wastes would need to be designed to meet nuclear criticality
safety requirements such as those specified in the American National Standard for Nuclear Criticality Safety in
Operations with Fissile Materials Outside Reactors (ANSI Standard No. 8.1). The standard currently includes polyethylene
and stainless steel as acceptable container materials providing they are chemically compatible with the wastes
being stored. Some containers designed to prevent the buildup of liquids could be used to store non-liquid fissionable
PCB/radioactive wastes, provided they are stored in an area which would contain any spilled liquids. If any such containers
were found to be leaking, their contents would have to be transferred immediately to non-leaking containers, and
the leaked or spilled materials cleaned-up taking into account relevant safety procedures appropriate for radioactive
materials. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
EPA is also proposing to amend 761.65(b)(1)(ii) to allow storage areas for PCB/fissionable radioactive wastes to
meet performance criteria for containment volume rather than specific requirements for curb height. This amendment
would retain the current requirements that facilities storing PCB/fissionable radioactive wastes store those
materials in a storage area meeting the containment volume requirements equal to at least two times the internal volume
of the largest PCB container stored therein or 25 percent of the total internal volume of all PCB containers stored
therein or whichever is greater, but would not impose curb height requirements for these wastes. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Several commenters stated that PCB/radioactive wastes may also contain additional materials such as asbestos that
cannot be incinerated. EPA believes that technology exists which allows PCBs to be separated from other materials
(e.g., radioactive waste or asbestos). EPA recommends that whenever possible PCBs be separated from other wastes;
however, today's proposal does not contain requirements for separating PCBs because guidance for separating PCBs,
from water for example, already exists. EPA had developed a policy allowing the physical separation of PCBs from other
wastes, so long as all waste parts separated from the original PCBs are regulated (TSCA Compliance Program Policy
6&hyph;PCB&hyph;2). 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
One commenter indicated that EPA does not have the jurisdiction to regulate radioactive PCBs under TSCA. EPA agrees
in part and disagrees in part. TSCA section 3(2)(B)(iv) states that the term ``chemical substance'' does not include
``any source material, special nuclear material, or byproduct material (as such terms are defined in the Atomic Energy
Act of 1954 and regulations issued under such Act).'' Generators of PCB/radioactive waste are subject to regulatory
oversight for radioactive materials under the Atomic Energy Act of 1954 as amended (DOE or NRC). EPA, on the other hand,
has regulatory oversight for PCBs under TSCA. Thus, generators of PCB/radioactive waste must comply with both EPA
and NRC regulations, State requirements, or DOE Orders. Mixtures of radioactive PCB molecules and non-radioactive
PCB molecules that cannot be separated are subject to TSCA and the AEA because, for regulatory purposes, when separation
of the PCB molecules is not achieved, the statutory exemption does not extend to nonradioactive PCBs in a mixture.
It should be noted that regulation of PCB/radioactive mixtures under TSCA and the AEA applies to both wastes and non-wastes.
The NRC and DOE participated in the development of this section in order to ensure compatibility between TSCA and AEA.

In the ANPRM, EPA solicited comments on whether to establish a household waste exemption under TSCA, and information
regarding current PCB uses that are not authorized in the regulations. Items 1 and 2 below discuss the household waste

 Household waste exemption.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 EPA solicited comments in the ANPRM on whether a household waste exemption, similar to the household waste exclusion
under RCRA at 40 CFR 261.4, should be established under the TSCA PCB disposal regulations. The RCRA household waste
exclusion exempts from the hazardous waste requirements any material that was derived from households (including
single and multiple residences, hotels and motels, bunk houses, ranger stations, crew quarters, campgrounds, picnic
grounds, and day use recreation areas). Examples of household waste under the RCRA exclusion include garbage, trash,
and sanitary wastes in septic tanks. Under the RCRA criteria, household waste is limited to: (1) Waste generated by
individuals on the premises of a household, and (2) waste composed primarily of materials found in the wastes generated
by consumers in their homes (49 FR 44978, November 13, 1984). Additionally, EPA sought comments on the types of PCB
wastes for which such an exemption would be applicable. In today's notice, EPA is proposing a household waste exemption
for any waste containing PCBs generated by individuals on the premises of private households (including single or
individually owned or rented units of a multi-unit construction) primarily found in wastes generated by consumers
in their homes, i.e., domestic wastes (see proposed regulatory text at 761.3 and 761.63). This change in the PCB regulations
would authorize private homeowners, including individually owned or rented units of a multi-unit construction,
to dispose of their unwanted household items that contain hazardous and toxic wastes under a municipal solid waste
collection program without fear of recrimination even though the homeowner may have knowledge of the existence of
PCBs in the household appliance. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
EPA received roughly a dozen comments, and all but two supported the establishment of a household waste exemption.
Some commenters provided additional caveats on how such an exemption should be structured. Comments in favor of the
household waste exemption essentially fell into four categories: (1) Broadly define the scope of the exemption,
(2) consider the impact of the exemption on recycling activities, (3) limit the scope of the exemption, and (4) address
other disposal considerations (i.e., the disposal of materials containing PCBs used in the construction of residential
buildings). Commenters not in favor of the TSCA proposal for an exemption questioned whether there should be a household
waste exemption under either TSCA or RCRA, and whether the volume of waste containing PCBs which was generated from
households was significant enough to warrant an exemption. EPA's responses to the four broad categories of comments
are provided below.

a.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
 Broadly define exemption
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
. Those in favor of establishing a household waste exemption suggested broadly defining the activities that would
qualify for the exemption. One commenter suggested EPA use the definition for ``Municipal solid wastes'' found at
761.3 to define the scope of the household waste exemption. Municipal solid wastes are defined as ``garbage, refuse,
sludges, wastes and other discarded materials resulting from residential and non-industrial operations and activities,
such as household activities, office functions, and commercial housekeeping wastes.'' However, if such a change
was made, the exemption would include items EPA believes should not be excluded from regulation (e.g., PCB wastes
from offices and commercial activities). Another commenter stated that commercial buildings should also be included
in a household waste exemption because the wastes generated at these buildings may be from the same sources and types
of equipment found in the household. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The effect of banning the manufacture, processing, and distribution in commerce of PCBs, coupled with actions taken
to limit the use of PCBs, focuses the Agency's concern on activities where the continued use of PCBs has been authorized
(i.e., industrial or commercial-scale settings such as utilities, manufacturing sites, construction/renovation/demolition
projects, etc.) rather than on household settings where appliances with PCBs may not generally be found (Ref. 32).
Additionally, industrial and commercial-scale PCB disposal activities, because of the risks associated with the
greater volume of PCB wastes generated by these activities, require a level of protection for health and the environment
that can best be achieved through demonstrated and effective PCB destruction and containment technologies. Therefore,
EPA is not persuaded that a broadly defined household waste exemption, encompassing large volumes of commercial-scale
PCB wastes, would be protective of health and the environment.

 Impact on recycling activities.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 One commenter stated that the exemption should include waste generated by households but diverted or removed from
the wastestream for purposes of recycling. Another commenter stated EPA should control the recycling and storage
of household waste (e.g., increase the storage timeframe from 1 to 2 years). The final set of comments associated with
this category suggested EPA take steps to encourage municipal collection programs for PCBs. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The recycling of household waste contaminated with PCBs surfaced as a national issue during 1985&hyph;86 when the
problem of PCB contamination in shredder fluff (i.e., the non-metallic residue from the shredding process) was first
identified. Since that period, EPA has conducted a pilot study of the shredding industry to ascertain, among other
things, the source of the PCB contamination (Ref. 34). When the fluff contamination problem first surfaced, PCB Small
Capacitors in household appliances were thought to be the source of the contamination. Therefore, data search/collection
activities were initiated to determine the types of appliances that would most likely contain PCB Small Capacitors.
The results of these efforts indicated that PCB Small Capacitors were not used in most household appliances. However,
EPA determined that there was a significant likelihood that PCB Small Capacitors could be found in room and central
air conditioners, heat pumps, furnace blowers, fluorescent lighting ballasts, and microwave ovens (Refs. 32 and
33). As a result, many States have implemented PCB Small Capacitor removal programs to ensure that PCBs are not intentionally
processed during shredding operations. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In proposing a TSCA household waste exemption, EPA recognizes that some objects that contain a PCB component may inadvertently
be shredded, resulting in fluff containing PCBs. EPA is proposing at 761.62(b) that this residue when tested and found
to be contaminated at levels of 50 ppm PCB or greater, but measuring less than 50 micrograms per liter (ppb) when using
RCRA's Toxicity Characteristic Leaching Procedure (see 40 CFR part 261 Appendix II) may be disposed of in a facility
that is permitted, licensed, or registered by a State as a municipal or industrial waste landfill. However, shredder
residue when tested and found to contain 50 ppm or greater PCBs must be managed pursuant to the current disposal requirements
at 761.60. (Additional disposal options for this type of waste are proposed at 761.62 and discussed at Unit II.A.5.
of this preamble.) Under the current regulations, the processing and distribution in commerce of PCBs is prohibited
unless otherwise authorized by rulemaking or under a PCB exemption. The proposed household waste exemption authorizes
these activities for household wastes containing PCBs. The processing of non-exempt, non-household items such
as commercial or industrial grade appliances containing PCBs, fixtures from renovation or demolition projects,
and industrial or heavy duty equipment containing PCBs would continue to be a violation of the PCB regulations. EPA
is not encouraging the processing and subsequent dilution of PCBs by recycling facilities.

 notice, EPA explained that the random disposal of PCB Equipment in municipal solid waste sites by householders and
other infrequent disposers did not present an environmental hazard (44 FR 31528). On the other hand, EPA determined
that the disposal of large quantities of PCB Small Capacitors posed a somewhat larger risk, and commercial and industrial
activities were encouraged to establish a voluntary collection and disposal program. EPA would therefore include
in the household waste exemption wastestreams created by recycling operations that accepted only wastes composed
of household items from private residences (see the discussion under Unit II.D.1.c., ``Limit Scope of the Exemption''
of this preamble). Therefore, the owner or operator of a recycling facility should establish contractual requirements
or other appropriate notification or inspection procedures to ensure that PCB wastes not covered under the exemption
(e.g., commercial or industrial appliances containing PCBs or fixtures from demolition or renovation projects,
industrial, or heavy-duty equipment containing PCBs) were not processed at the facility. In any event, the owner
or operator of such a facility would be subject to an enforcement action should such waste be processed. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Municipal collection programs accepting only those wastes that satisfy the proposed exemption criteria could operate
under the TSCA household waste exemption; the TSCA chemical waste landfill and incineration requirements would
not apply to the disposal of these wastes (see the discussion under Unit II.D.1.c., ``Limit Scope of the Exemption''
of this preamble). Because disposal of the wastes collected under a municipal solid waste program that satisfy the
criteria proposed for the exemption would not be regulated by this rule, the wastes could be disposed of in a facility
which is permitted, licensed, or registered by a State to manage municipal or industrial waste. As a result, the commercial
storage approval requirement and compliance with the TSCA PCB 1&hyph;year time limit for storage and disposal limitation
would not apply. Therefore, EPA does not see a need to extend the storage timeframe from 1 to 2 years as suggested by one
commenter.

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 A few commenters stressed the need to restrict the applicability of a household waste exemption to purely residential
settings in order to exclude business activities that take place in a residence. Another commenter believed the exemption
should be identical to the RCRA household waste exclusion. EPA has interpreted the RCRA Subtitle C rules at 40 CFR 261.4
as limiting the exclusion to those household wastes that meet two criteria: (1) The waste must be generated by individuals
on the premises of either a temporary or permanent household, and (2) the waste must be composed primarily of materials
found in wastes generated by consumers in their homes. The RCRA exclusion at 40 CFR 261.4(b) includes ``household
waste from single and multiple dwellings, hotels and motels, and other residential sources.'' The RCRA hazardous
waste program, in establishing a household waste exclusion, acted upon a Congressional intent to ensure that wastes
generated by consumers in their households would be exempt from the Subtitle C regulation. As a result, the RCRA exclusion
included materials from single and multiple residences, hotels, motels, bunkhouses, ranger stations, crew quarters,
campgrounds, picnic grounds, and day use recreation areas _ locations at which consumer activity is of a type that
would be conducted in a residential setting and result in the generation of hazardous wastes. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
As commenters have suggested, EPA is proposing an exemption under TSCA for the disposal of household wastes containing
PCBs that is similar, but not identical, to the RCRA exclusion. Like the RCRA exclusion, the TSCA exemption would not
include non-residential PCB wastes such as commercial or industrial grade appliances containing PCBs, fixtures
from demolition or renovation projects, and industrial or heavy duty PCB Equipment. Under TSCA, Congress sought
to eliminate the use of PCBs, unless specifically authorized, by banning their continued manufacture, processing,
and distribution in commerce. However, Congress intended that the use of equipment which contained PCBs in a totally
enclosed manner not be terminated prior to the end of the equipment's useful life. As stated earlier, research conducted
by EPA suggests that some refrigerators and household freezers, room and central air conditioners, heat pumps, furnace
blowers, fluorescent lighting ballasts, and microwave ovens may contain PCB Small Capacitors. The risks associated
with the disposal of those items containing PCB Small Capacitors in a random, geographically dispersed manner by
individual homeowners were considered by EPA in mid-1977 when it proposed the PCB Small Capacitor exemption. EPA
has re-evaluated this issue twice subsequent to that time and has determined that the exemption should remain in place
(see the discussion at Unit II.D.3.c. of this preamble). 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The distinction that EPA makes between the TSCA household waste exemption, which focuses on consumer products used
by individuals in private residences, and the RCRA household waste exclusion, which focuses on consumer activity
conducted by private individuals in temporary or permanent residences, is based on the continued belief that the
unregulated disposal of large quantities of PCB Items such as light ballasts and PCB Small Capacitors by commercial
and industrial activities presents an environmental risk (see 42 FR 26568, May 24, 1977; 43 FR 7152, February 17, 1978;
44 FR 31528, May 31, 1979 and the discussion on the disposal of small capacitors at Unit II.D.3.c. of this preamble).

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Under RCRA, the risks associated with consumer activities that result in the generation of hazardous waste do not
change when the activities are conducted in a single or multiple residence, hotel, motel, bunkhouse, ranger station,
crew quarters, campgrounds, picnic grounds, or day use recreation areas. These are all locations at which the consumer
activity is of a type that would be conducted in a residential setting. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
For the PCB household waste exemption under TSCA, EPA believes that the unregulated disposal by individual households
of consumer products which contain PCBs should be exempted from the TSCA disposal requirements because there are
relatively few household products that would contain PCBs. The proposed exemption would not apply to individuals
who reside in transient settings because they would likely not dispose of household appliances that would contain
PCBs (e.g., certain refrigerators and household freezers, room and central air conditioners, heat pumps, furnace
blowers, fluorescent lighting ballasts, and microwave ovens). Rather, equipment containing PCBs obtained for
use in transient settings would likely be of a commercial grade and disposed of in quantity. Therefore, the removal
and disposal of equipment containing PCB Small Capacitors by commercial activities and entrepreneurial interests
such as hotel and motel chains and owners of multiple unit residential buildings engaged in repair, renovation, and/or
demolition projects, would not be covered by this exemption. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
EPA considered excluding from the TSCA household waste exemption PCB wastes found in a home-based business, but has
determined that PCB Items found in a private residence would likely be evident in these smaller business enterprises
as well. That is, industrial-scale manufacturing activities would not normally be conducted in a residential setting.
If, however, such was the case, only those PCB Items commonly found in a private household would be covered by this exemption.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Although EPA proposes to establish an exemption under TSCA for the disposal of household waste, the public is reminded
of the CERCLA reporting requirement for PCBs at 40 CFR 302.6 that essentially requires individuals to contact the
National Response Center when they are disposing of 1 pound or more of PCBs in any 24-hour period in a non-federally
permitted facility. The TSCA household waste exemption does not relieve an individual (i.e., the person disposing
of the waste and/or the owner of the disposal facility) of the liability for remediating PCB contamination if the non-federally
permitted disposal facility becomes a future Superfund site. Therefore, EPA is seeking comments on whether additional
limitations should be imposed when defining entities that would qualify for this exemption.

 Other disposal considerations.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 One commenter, although not objecting to the exemption, suggested EPA should focus on the previous residential applications
of PCBs, such as a wall painted with PCB-containing paint, and the item's sale, destruction, and disposal. The proposed
TSCA household waste exemption would not apply to debris produced during building construction, renovation, or
demolition and similar type wastes, since such wastes do not consist primarily of materials found in wastes generated
by a consumer in his/her home. Disposal options for this large-volume waste are discussed under Unit II.A. of this
preamble.

 Unauthorized use.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 EPA also sought comments in the ANPRM on widespread PCB applications that had not been addressed when the original
regulations were developed. EPA was particularly interested in obtaining information on current, but unauthorized
uses of PCBs. Nearly a dozen sets of comments were submitted from four primary sources: Natural gas pipeline companies,
the Armed Forces, civilian governmental agencies, and companies from the industrial sector. Items currently in
use and identified by the commenters as containing PCBs included wool felt insulating materials which have high levels
of PCBs and deck plates that are found on naval vessels; plastics, paints, small rubber parts, adhesive tape, and insulating
materials used in electrical cabling, for example; PCB-impregnated gaskets in heating, ventilation and air conditioning,
and other duct systems; concrete expansion joint materials, and large-diameter natural gas pipeline. Several distinct
``unauthorized use'' scenarios emerged based on a review of the comments and discussions with EPA Regional representatives.
These scenarios and the proposed regulatory provisions addressing these uses are discussed below.

. During the late 1940s through 1950s, the adhesive coating used on ventilation gaskets for use in the Department of
War (a predecessor of the Department of Energy (DOE)) heating, ventilation, and air conditioning (HVAC) systems
was impregnated with PCBs to comply with the Department of War's specifications. This application was not in violation
of the ban on the manufacture, use, processing, or distribution in commerce of PCBs because it occurred prior to the
enactment of TSCA and promulgation of the implementing regulations. However, in late 1989, DOE notified EPA that
over time, operation of their plants had caused small amounts of the lubricating oil (from motor and compressor bearings)
to leach through the gasket material and to be drawn into the ventilation system, resulting in releases of material
containing PCBs.

 The Department of the Navy discovered that wool felt containing PCBs had been installed in older submarines for sound-dampening
purposes. Information provided to EPA by the Department of the Navy indicates no PCBs are emitted from the material
and that the material is generally located in inaccessible or rarely accessed areas, fixed between metal plates.
The Navy's current policy is to remove the material only when necessary (i.e., during maintenance).

 Agency experience.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 Experience gained in implementing the PCB requirements has resulted in the identification of other uses of PCBs that
are not authorized by the regulations. Issues have arisen over time concerning the use of PCBs in paint formulations,
coatings for ceiling tiles, roofing, and siding materials, adhesives, waterproofing compounds, and any number
of other chemical uses such as additives and plasticizers. The recent discovery of asbestos roofing and siding materials
and insulating (potting) material in fluorescent light ballasts that contain PCBs are illustrations of the Agency's
expanding knowledge of the applications for PCBs. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In November 1992, EPA was informed of the discovery of PCBs in asbestos roofing and siding materials that had been manufactured
by H. H. Robertson (circa 1917) and marketed as Robertson Protected Metal (RPM) and Galbestos. RPM and Galbestos are
multilayered steel siding materials that consist of steel, asphalt, or zinc (depending on the product line); asphalt-impregnated
asbestos felt; and an asphaltic waterproof coating. Although there is limited evidence available that PCBs were
ever introduced in the manufacturing process, preliminary sampling and analysis have indicated PCB concentrations
in this material ranging from 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=6 f=2 -->
&lt;
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
2 ppm to 30,000 ppm. These products were purchased and used internationally by the U.S. Department of Defense (Department
of War, U.S. Navy, U.S. Army, U.S. Air Force, U.S. Marine Corps), U.S. Coast Guard, Tennessee Valley Authority, and
various industries such as airlines, railroads, chemical plants, steel mills, mines, and industrial/manufacturing
facilities. Manufacturing facilities for RPM and Galbestos products were located in Beaver Falls, PA, and subsequently
relocated to Ambridge, PA, as well as in Canada and England. Preliminary data suggests that the continued use of this
material, if in good condition, and subsequent disposal in a municipal solid waste landfill, would not present an
unreasonable risk of injury to health or the environment (see ``Toxic Characteristic Leaching Procedure (TCLP)
for Galbestos Siding Material'' MRI Report, Project No. 9802&hyph;30&hyph;01, August 16, 1993 [Ref. 45]). 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Also, in August/September 1993 EPA received data from several sources indicating that PCBs were found in the insulating
(potting) materials of fluorescent light ballasts generally manufactured prior to 1978. PCBs at concentrations
of 50 ppm or greater were found in the insulating materials of approximately 70 percent of the ballasts analyzed. While
this data represents only a small portion of ballasts manufactured prior to 1978 still in use today, the continued
use of such ballasts would need to be authorized. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
EPA is proposing at 40 CFR 761.30(q) to authorize the use and distribution in commerce of non-liquid materials which
contain PCBs at any concentration (including, but not limited to, gaskets, insulation, plastics, plasticizers,
fluorescent light ballast potting materials, electrical cable, dried paints, small rubber parts, adhesive tape,
caulking, roofing and siding materials, waterproofing compounds, and ceiling tile coatings) in use prior to July
2, 1979, for the remainder of their useful life where monitoring indicates that the migration of PCBs from the material
does not pose an unreasonable risk of injury. Under the proposed authorization, the PCB-containing materials must
remain intact and in place in their existing application and location unless they are being removed for disposal.
The authorization of continued use and distribution in commerce of these PCB materials do not include an authorization
to remove the material from its existing location and subsequently reassemble or install the PCB material at a different
location but would allow for continued use in a mobile application such as a vehicle or vessel. Such PCB materials currently
in use that exhibit significant PCB migration, as discussed in proposed 761.30(q)(1)(iii), (iv) or (v), would not
be in compliance with this authorization and would be required to be removed, contained by means of encapsulation
(either with an epoxy-based or equivalent paint or sealant), or equipped with release controls in which a continual
release is collected in a closed container and displaces only the air in the container (i.e., a leak collection system)
to ensure personnel are protected from dermal and inhalation exposures. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Additionally, the owner or operator of a facility with such a use of PCB material would be required to notify the Regional
Administrator of the discovery of such material and submit documentary evidence that established the historical
use of such material. Notification to the Regional Administrator would be required within 30 days of the effective
date of the final rule or within 30 days of discovery thereafter. It would be required to include the location of the
material, a description of its use, an estimate of the amount of material in use (e.g., number, square footage, pounds),
the PCB concentration, expected useful life of the material, the condition of the material (e.g., potential for exposure),
and any additional information that might be useful to the Regional Administrator. Secondly, the owner or operator
of the facility would be required to post a PCB Mark ML as described in 761.40 in a prominent location near material containing
PCBs as a warning of the presence of PCBs. They would also be required to make available to any potentially exposed employee
and, upon request, to any other potentially exposed individual, information concerning the identity of the PCBs
and any health risk associated with the PCB application. Failure to provide documentary evidence that substantiated
the historical use of such material might result in the rejection of such claims by the Regional Administrator. Consequently,
the continued use of such materials might be a violation of the PCB regulations. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Air monitoring readings and standard wipe test samples of exterior surfaces would have to be taken and recorded quarterly
for the first year and annually thereafter until the material was removed. Records would be maintained in a central
location at the facility for 3 years beyond the date of removal of the material for review by EPA officials. Air monitoring
results of PCB levels above 0.001 milligram per cubic meter of air (mg/m

) for a 10&hyph;hour workday, 40&hyph;hour workweek (the National Institute of Occupational Safety and Health's

) would require that action be initiated within 24 hours of the occurrence to modify the release controls, to re-encapsulate
the surface, or to remove the PCB-impregnated materials. In addition, individuals would be required to notify the
EPA Regional Toxics Office by facsimile machine or overnight delivery mail services within 24 hours of the occurrence
of an environmental release that exceeded the action levels listed above. The notification would indicate the actions
that would be taken to bring the facility into compliance. However, if the release occurred during a weekend or Federal
holiday, notification could be made during the next business day. This notification would not be in lieu of any other
Federal, State, or local notification requirements such as those under CERCLA for the release of a hazardous substance
(see 40 CFR 302.6). 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
At the end of their current useful life, all such PCB materials with a PCB concentration of 50 ppm or greater, and materials
that came in contact with 50 ppm or greater PCBs, including leak collection systems, PCB-containing paint and other
encapsulation materials, and all materials used during decontamination or cleanup procedures would have to be handled,
stored, and disposed of in accordance with the PCB storage requirements at 40 CFR 761.65 and the disposal requirements
at 761.60 or 761.62. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
While the continued use of unauthorized pre-TSCA PCB materials is a violation of the existing PCB regulations, in
most cases, premature removal of the media containing PCBs could only be achieved with great difficulty and at enormous
expense given the extraordinary efforts that would be required to remove the PCBs. The conditions proposed by EPA
for the continued use of these items (i.e., removal upon evidence of deterioration, installation of release controls,
or encapsulation) would ensure no unreasonable risk from exposure to PCBs as a result of the continued use of these
materials. Comments are therefore solicited on whether consideration should be given to developing authorizations
for the conditional, continued use of these materials and whether additional restrictions should be imposed and
if there are other situations which are similar to the pre-1978 authorization issues which should be addressed in
this rulemaking. Comments are also solicited on whether the proposed authorization should allow for the movement
and reassembly of the PCB-Containing material when such movement and reassembly will not adversely impact the integrity
of the material (e.g., will not result in a risk of injury to health or the environment caused by the exposure to PCBs).
Comments supporting a modification of the proposed authorization should also provide examples of the specific material
and reuse scenarios that should be addressed. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
EPA has no information indicating that PCBs were routinely used in the formulation of consumer products such as household
paints, sealants, finishes or caulking. It believes however, that consumers could now occasionally obtain products
such as industrial enamels or marine paints which were formulated with PCBs, through the purchase of these items as
surplus. The sale of these unauthorized items containing PCBs is currently prohibited under TSCA. Identification
and removal of these materials, once installed in households, could pose considerable costs to homeowners while
increasing risk of exposure through removal. Because the PCBs are bound into these materials, EPA believes they would
not pose a serious risk of exposure if left in place. Therefore, EPA is proposing a general use authorization at 761.30(q)(2)
for the non-liquid PCBs that meet the definition of household wastes at the time of disposal. In unit II.A. of this preamble
EPA discussed a proposed exemption for the disposal of household wastes containing PCBs. Today, EPA is also proposing
a general authorization for continued use at 761.30(g)(3) for non-liquid items that do not leach PCBs at levels

 Reuse of natural gas pipeline.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 EPA received comments on both the reuse of and the disposal requirements for natural gas pipeline. A discussion concerning
the disposal of natural gas pipeline appears at Unit II.D.3.e of this preamble. Regarding the reuse of pipeline, commenters
contend that the inadvertent contamination of natural gas pipeline at or above regulated levels for PCBs all but eliminates
any opportunity for the natural gas industry to reuse the pipe and other natural gas pipeline appurtenances. Requirements
to dispose of or decontaminate the equipment often deprive these companies of the economic benefits associated with
recycling, reusing, or selling the equipment. EPA, under a Memorandum of Understanding (MOU) with the Federal Energy
Regulatory Commission (FERC), has been reviewing pipeline abandonment plans and issuing alternate disposal permits
for the decontamination of pipeline since late 1987. Based on this experience, EPA does not view risks of injury to
health and the environment from exposure to PCBs due to the continued use of PCB-Contaminated pipeline as being unreasonable.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
PCBs when found in natural gas pipeline are generally located in the condensate that is collected from drips and geographical
low points along the pipeline or in the moisture on the interior of the pipe. Since these collection points are often
dry, EPA is proposing, as an alternative for characterization purposes, surface levels of greater than 10 micrograms
PCB per 100 square centimeters for dry pipe as the regulatory equivalent of 50 ppm, and 100 micrograms PCB per 100 square
centimeters in dry pipe as the regulatory equivalent of 500 ppm with regard to the TSCA PCB regulatory requirements
at part 761 (characterization of natural gas pipeline is discussed at Unit II.B.4. of this preamble). EPA is proposing
to amend 761.30(i) to authorize the reuse of natural gas pipeline systems, provided the liquids have been removed.
All removed liquids must be disposed of pursuant to the disposal requirements at 761.60(a)(3). EPA solicits comments
on whether EPA should require marking of pipe that may be in temporary storage while testing is being conducted. Pipe
in temporary storage is generally capped at each end and stacked in a restricted area along the perimeter of the pipeline
system. EPA solicits comment on whether the Agency should require each pipe in a temporary storage area to be marked
or whether only posting a sign in the storage area would be adequate. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In today's notice at 761.30(i), the reuse of PCB-Contaminated natural gas pipeline and appurtenances would be allowed
in natural gas pipeline systems. Natural gas pipeline and pipeline appurtenances that were to be reused would have
to be drained of free-flowing liquids and decontaminated pursuant to procedures proposed in 761.30(i). Any natural
gas pipeline may also meet the decontamination level as proposed in 761.79(d). Based on experience gained from issuing
alternate disposal approvals to pipeline companies, EPA is also proposing several additional uses. Acceptable
proposed reuse scenarios are for the transport of bulk hydrocarbons, chemicals, or petroleum products; as a coal
slurry pipeline; as casing to provide secondary containment under transportation systems such as highways or railroads;
as temporary flume at construction sites; as culverts (less than 80 feet in length) in intermittent flow situations
(i.e., as culvert for a driveway over a roadside ditch); as equipment skids; for sewage service with written consent
of the Publicly Owned Treatment Works (POTW); for steam service; in totally enclosed compressed air systems; as irrigation
systems where the pipe is less than 20 inches in diameter and 200 miles in length; or as industrial structural material
such as fence posts, sign posts, gate posts, bridge supports, and overhead sign cross members. In addition to commenters'
reactions as to whether natural gas pipeline should be authorized for reuse in these scenarios, EPA solicits comments
on the other specific uses for which this pipe would be suitable. The reader should remember that the reuse provision
is intended for contaminated equipment which is drained of all free flowing liquid (i.e., the surface is dry) and the
surface contamination is demonstrated to be less than 100 micrograms PCBs per 100 square centimeters. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
EPA is also proposing a parallel authorization for the use of PCBs in other pipelines or air compressor systems, with
the consent of the Regional Administrator. The Agency is aware of the use of PCBs as lubricants in other air compressor
systems not associated with natural gas pipelines and believes that these uses pose no greater risk.

. The disposal of non-liquid, bound materials, such as plastic insulating material containing PCBs found in electrical
cabling and lead (Pb) cable insulated with PCB oil-soaked paper, were also identified by commenters to the ANPRM as
issues that are not adequately addressed by the current regulations. Since the ANPRM, EPA has also received comments
addressing the disposal requirements for the relatively small quantity of waste generated during the chemical analysis
of PCBs.

 Disposal of PCB-bound material.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 One commenter requested that EPA designate these materials as unregulated for disposal. The PCB concentration encased
in this solid plastic insulating material ranges from less than 50 ppm to 500 ppm PCBs. The commenter argues that non-liquid,
bound PCB materials are distinct from liquid PCBs and that the current exemption at 761.60(b)(2)(ii) that allows
persons, except manufacturers, to dispose of PCB Small Capacitors in municipal landfills should be extended to cover
manufactured items containing non-liquid, bound PCB materials. Alternatively, the commenter argues that the PCB
bound plastic insulation should be treated as ``other PCB Articles'' having a PCB concentration between 50 and 500
ppm pursuant to the current 761.60(b)(5)(ii). The commenter suggests that these bound PCB materials should be viewed
as having been drained of free flowing liquid and should be treated as unregulated for disposal under that section.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
However, EPA is proposing provisions at 761.62 to address the disposal of PCB non-remediation wastes using one of
four options: Incineration, chemical waste landfill, municipal solid waste landfill, or a disposal method approved
by the Regional Administrator. Under this provision, the Regional Administrator could approve an alternate disposal
method based, among other things, on technical, environmental, or waste-specific characteristics or considerations
indicating that the disposal method would not pose an unreasonable risk of injury to health or the environment. EPA
believes that this provision would provide the flexibility being sought by the commenter, and that expansion of the
current exemption would therefore be unnecessary.

 Another commenter informed EPA of lead-sheathed cable containing PCBs in the oil-soaked paper that is used to wrap
the copper conductors; the PCB levels typically range from 50 to 500 ppm with some levels reported as exceeding 100,000
ppm. Discarded lead cable is potentially stored for long periods of time, pending changes in the metals market, and
then ultimately sent to scrap yards where the metal is removed and sold to recycling operations. The scrap yards then
burn the PCB-soaked paper without regard to its PCB content. This may result in illegal disposal and site contamination
by PCBs, dioxins, and dibenzofurans. Further, cables that are not contained in a conduit are often abandoned in place.
The cable is ripped out to a convenient point, cut, and abandoned with no protection at all for the cut end. The PCB-containing
oil will often leak, as free flowing oil, from the paper when the cable is cut or the covering damaged, thereby creating
environmental concerns when cable runs are abandoned or old cable is improperly stored or disposed of.

According to the information submitted by the commenter, lead cable is used in high voltage distribution of electric
power, typically 5,000 volts and above. This cable has been in use for quite some time (about 100 years), and although
lead cable can be found everywhere, including in overhead distribution lines, the product typically was used in underground,
submerged, or submersible applications. In particular, lead cable was used to supply primary power to vaulted network
distribution systems and subway transformers. Almost all utilities serving metropolitan areas and most large industrial
facilities either currently own or have owned significant quantities of lead cable. Large commercial facilities
that distribute primary power also have lead cable.

On August 25, 1982 (47 FR 37352), EPA promulgated 40 CFR 761.30(m) to authorize the use of PCBs in, and the servicing
of, cable containing any concentration of PCBs for the useful life of the cable provided the cable is serviced (including
rebuilding) only with dielectric fluid containing less than 50 ppm PCBs. This provision was based in part on a study
conducted by the Edison Electric Institute (EEI) and the Utilities Solid Waste Activities Group (USWAG) that described
voltage regulators, switches, electromagnets, and cable as mineral oil-filled electrical equipment, not designed
to contain PCB dielectric fluid. The rulemaking record indicates that this oil-filled cable generally contained
less than 50 ppm PCBs (Previous Rulemaking Record Ref. 6, Support Document for the Electrical Equipment Use Rule,
Response to Comments, August 1982). Although this oil-filled cable was authorized for use until it reached the end
of its lifecycle, EPA required that the disposal requirements at 40 CFR 761.60 and the servicing requirements at 761.30(m)(2)
be followed for any cable found to contain a PCB concentration of at least 50 ppm. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Therefore, the issue being raised by the commenter suggests that other types of electrical cable containing PCBs
may exist that were not anticipated when 761.30(m) was promulgated. As reflected at Unit II.D.2. of this preamble,
proposed 761.30(q) would expressly allow the continued use of electrical cable, in a totally enclosed manner, until
it reached the end of its useful life. However, the installation of materials containing PCBs as insulation and the
processing and distribution in commerce, except for purposes of disposal, would continue to be unauthorized. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Comments are solicited on whether EPA should include electrical cable under the proposed authorization to be inserted
at 761.30(q) or expand its interpretation of the current authorization at 761.30(m) to include, in addition to oil-filled
cable, all electrical cable containing PCBs such as electrical cable encased with PCB-impregnated insulation materials,
and lead cable containing PCB oil-soaked paper. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
EPA also welcomes information on any other electrical cable containing PCBs, including its uses, PCB concentrations,
and potential risks of exposure to workers, the general public, and the environment. For example, high-voltage cable
used in underground coal mines may have been manufactured with PCBs in the conductor insulation. In 1954, the U.S.
Bureau of Mines published fire-resistance standards for underground electrical equipment. In addition to requiring
non-flammable liquid [e.g., PCB dielectric fluid] in liquid-filled transformers, the Bureau also published a fire
test procedure which was mandatory for ``trailing cables,'' or electric cables that are reeled out the back of mobile,
high-voltage mining equipment such as continuous miners and shuttle cars (Ref. 56). The fire resistance test was
considered prudent because trailing cables, which lie on the mine floor, are often damaged by equipment travel and
can short out, causing an electrical fire. While the Bureau did not specify how such cable should be made, experience
with naval vessels indicates that such cable could have been manufactured with PCBs to meet the test standards. Some
of this cable may still be in use or may be abandoned with other electrical equipment in mine storage areas or in closed
mines. An environmental hazard would exist if the cable is improperly disposed of. A hazard to workers would exist
from inhalation of the fumes during an electrical short or from dermal contact when splicing cable. Therefore, EPA
is seeking comment from any person who may know of past uses of PCBs in electrical cables. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In response to concerns raised about handling lead cable, EPA cannot emphasize strongly enough that caution must
be exercised when handling any electrical cable which contains PCBs. First, caution must be exercised when servicing
the cable to prevent the inadvertent release of PCBs into the environment. In this instance, restrictions attendant
to the disposal of lead complicate the PCB disposal process, as environmental releases must be controlled when separating
the PCB and lead materials to ensure further contamination is avoided. Further, to ensure the PCBs are not reintroduced
into commerce, the lead cable must be decontaminated to remove the residual PCBs prior to sending it to a recycling
operation. The processing and distribution in commerce for the purpose of disposal of regulated PCB wastes and their
destruction require an approval (i.e., permit) from EPA (see 761.20(c)(2) and 761.60(a)). Owners and operators
of scrap yards who engage in activities to decontaminate the cable (i.e., to remove the PCBs) and/or destroy PCBs at
concentrations of 50 ppm or greater through the practice of ``open burning'' may be subject to an enforcement action
and are conducting these activities in violation of the TSCA permit requirements if they do not possess a PCB disposal
approval. Finally, owners and operators of recycling operations who accept lead cable containing PCBs for processing
are operating in violation of the TSCA ban on processing PCBs if they have not obtained an exemption for their activities
(see 761.20(c)). 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The disposal activities identified by the commenter are currently regulated under the TSCA PCB regulations at 40
CFR part 761 to include abandonment in place, storage, disposal, permitting, and manifesting requirements for PCB
wastes at concentrations of 50 ppm or greater. Therefore, from a regulatory perspective, no further rules are required
to address the disposal of this cable. However, an outreach program designed to reach scrap and salvaging operations
may be the most appropriate mechanism to ensure the owners and operators of these facilities are educated about their
responsibilities regarding the TSCA PCB disposal approval requirements and potential liabilities under CERCLA
for environmental releases of PCBs. EPA solicits the cooperation of the Institute of Scrap Recycling Industries,
Inc. (ISRI) and any other individuals, organizations, or associations in developing a comprehensive mailing list
of facilities to whom such an outreach program could be directed.

 Disposal of small capacitors.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 Another commenter suggested that EPA define the disposal requirements for PCB Small Capacitors and then cross reference
these disposal requirements to the CERCLA requirements for reporting releases of hazardous substances. The TSCA
disposal requirements for PCB Capacitors are provided at 761.60(b)(2); CERCLA reporting requirements for hazardous
substance releases are listed at 40 CFR 302.6. The regulations in 40 CFR 302.6(a) state: ``Any person in charge of a
vessel or an offshore or an onshore facility shall, as soon as he has knowledge of any release (other than a federally
permitted release or application of a pesticide) of a hazardous substance from such vessel or facility in a quantity
equal to or exceeding the reportable quantity determined by this part in any 24&hyph;hour period, immediately notify
the National Response Center ((800) 424&hyph;8802; in Washington, DC (202) 426&hyph;2675).'' 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Since PCBs are a hazardous substance with a reportable quantity (RQ) of 1 pound under CERCLA, the question becomes
which scenarios constitute a ``release'' under CERCLA. In the case of fluorescent light ballasts containing PCB
Small Capacitors, open or closed drums of light ballasts collectively containing 1 pound or more of PCBs, that are
abandoned or otherwise disposed of, such as through placement in a municipal solid waste landfill, would generally
be regarded as a reportable release under CERCLA. One point should be made clear; unlike TSCA or RCRA, CERCLA imposes
no disposal requirements itself on the initial disposal (i.e., release) of hazardous substances such as PCBs, even
if the release is in excess of the RQ for that substance. For specifics regarding the reporting requirements for the
release of hazardous substances under CERCLA, readers are advised to contact EPA's Superfund/RCRA Hotline, which
is the information service for the Office of Solid Waste and Emergency Response in Washington, D.C. (Toll-free (800)

In promulgating the disposal and marking rule published on February 1978 (43 FR 7150), EPA decided not to impose special
disposal requirements for small capacitors (except those owned by capacitor manufacturers or PCB Article manufacturers
in which the small capacitor was placed as a result of manufacturing activities) due to problems associated with regulating
this class of PCB wastes (e.g., enforcement difficulties, the expense associated with their collection/disposal,
and issues surrounding the question of who should incur these costs). In reassessing whether steps should be taken
to further limit the small capacitor exemption, EPA determined not to impose additional regulatory controls (44
FR 31528, May 31, 1979). However, because the disposal of large quantities of PCB Small Capacitors by commercial and
industrial activities posed a somewhat larger risk to the environment than disposal by householders and other infrequent
disposers, EPA encouraged commercial and industrial firms to establish a voluntary PCB Small Capacitor collection
and disposal program that would result in the disposal of these capacitors in either a chemical waste landfill or an
incinerator. EPA still recommends disposing of fluorescent light ballasts containing intact and non-leaking PCB
Small Capacitors in an approved hazardous waste incinerator or an approved chemical waste landfill. Persons who
can dispose of such fluorescent light ballasts under the household waste exemption should consider utilizing local
hazardous waste collection efforts sponsored by city/county health departments, local fire departments or other
local government entities for disposal of these items. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Under the current regulations, PCB Small Capacitors found in light ballasts generally are not required to be disposed
of in a TSCA approved disposal facility (see 761.60(b)(2)(ii)). Readers are, however, advised that State and local
governments may impose more stringent disposal requirements on items containing PCB Small Capacitors such as fluorescent
light ballasts and are advised to determine all other disposal requirements prior to undertaking disposal. EPA's
Office of Air and Radiation has developed guidance addressing these activities in conjunction with its ``Green Lights
Program'' (Ref. 53). Once a PCB Small Capacitor starts leaking, it is regulated for disposal under 761.60(d) as a PCB
Article and must be disposed of according to the disposal rules for PCB Articles at 761.60(b)(5) (Ref. 57). Also, 761.60(b)(2)(iv)
identifies another exception: ``Any PCB Small Capacitor owned by any person who manufactures or at any time manufactured
PCB Capacitors or PCB Equipment and acquired the PCB Capacitors in the course of such manufacture shall be disposed
of in ... an incinerator which complies with 761.70 or until March 1, 1981, ... in a chemical waste landfill which complies
with 761.75.'' In practice, this means that, except for manufacturers of capacitors or manufacturers of equipment
containing small capacitors, any quantity of intact, non-leaking small capacitors may be disposed of in a municipal
landfill. As mentioned earlier in this section, EPA reevaluated the scope of the small capacitor exemption and determined
not to impose additional regulatory controls. In the 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 -->
Federal Register
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 notice of May 31, 1979 (44 FR 31528), EPA also warned readers that any PCB spillage that might result from failure of,
or from damage to small capacitors, could be considered illegal disposal, as is the case for other spills of PCBs. If
the insulating material inside the ballast, sometimes referred to as ``potting'' material, contains PCBs at greater
than or equal to 50 ppm, then the entire ballast is regulated for disposal under current rules even if the internal small
capacitor remains intact and nonleaking. Many facilities are disposing of light ballasts or their capacitors in
TSCA incinerators to avoid the potential for Superfund liability should today's municipal landfills become subject
to future CERCLA cleanup action. Therefore, EPA proposes to include a statement in 761.60(b)(2)(vii) in response
to the commenter's suggestion that the PCB regulations cross reference the CERCLA requirements. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Since the publication of the ANPRM, EPA has received a TSCA section 21 petition from several fluorescent light ballast
recyclers and the Hazardous Waste Treatment Council (Ref. 49). The petitioners requested that disposal requirements
for intact and non-leaking small capacitors in fluorescent light ballasts at 761.60(b)(2)(ii) be amended to require
incineration of fluorescent light ballasts or incineration of the PCB Small Capacitors or PCB potting materials
removed by recycling the fluorescent light ballasts. EPA granted their petition and stated its intention to initiate
a regulatory investigation to determine whether or not to amend the PCB Small Capacitor disposal requirements at
761.60(b)(2)(ii) (Ref. 50). 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
As noted earlier, EPA has discussed the disposal and phaseout of PCB Small Capacitors in various rulemakings. In 1979,
EPA encouraged firms disposing of large quantities of PCB Small Capacitors to establish a voluntary collection and
disposal program resulting in the waste capacitors going to chemical waste landfills or high temperature incinerators
(44 FR 31514, 31528, May 31, 1979). In 1982, EPA revisited the issue of small capacitors, this time in regard to their
potential phaseout. EPA concluded that because many of these PCB-containing small capacitors are encapsulated
and contain minimal quantities (0.1 to 0.6 pounds) of fluid and a significant amount of absorbent materials such as
paper, PCBs are rarely released from the capacitors during their use or from equipment using the capacitors. Therefore,
EPA determined the exposure risks to humans, food, feed, water, and the environment were low (47 FR 37342 and 37349,
August 25, 1982). 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In their petition, petitioners raised a number of issues for which EPA is seeking information regarding the proposed
amendment of the disposal requirements for intact and non-leaking PCB Small Capacitors, specifically those in fluorescent
light ballasts. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
First, the petitioners indicated that the PCBs are not only found in small capacitors but in the potting material of
fluorescent light ballasts as well. EPA is seeking data on the level of PCBs found in the potting materials of fluorescent
light ballasts and whether the PCBs were in the potting material prior to recycling, i.e., were the PCBs in the potting
material because of a rupture of the PCB Small Capacitor. EPA is also seeking data on the percentage of ballasts recycled
that contain PCBs in either a small capacitor and/or the potting material, as well as the concentration of PCBs in the
potting material. EPA is also seeking information regarding the manufacture of light ballasts that have PCBs in their
potting materials, i.e., date of manufacture, PCB concentration, etc. However, any additional disposal requirements
for fluorescent light ballasts with PCB Small Capacitors become moot if the ballast potting material contains PCBs.
Fluorescent light ballasts with PCBs in their potting material meet the definitional requirements of PCB Articles
under 761.3 and the disposal requirements for such items are already prescribed at 761.60(b)(5). If PCBs 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=6 f=2 -->
;
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
50 ppm are found in the potting materials of fluorescent light ballasts, the issue of continued use becomes a significant
problem because such PCBs are not authorized for use under 761.30. However, PCBs found at 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=6 f=2 -->
&lt;
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
50 ppm (and not the result of dilution) in the potting compound would qualify the fluorescent light ballast as an ``Excluded
PCB Products'' as defined at 761.3. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Second, if EPA determines that additional disposal requirements need to be placed on fluorescent light ballasts
containing PCB Small Capacitors, the number of ballasts that may be disposed of as municipal solid waste within a 1-year
period needs to be determined. EPA is proposing at 761.60(b)(2)(viii) that any person may dispose of up to 25 intact
and non-leaking fluorescent light ballasts containing PCB Small Capacitors as household waste in a municipal solid
waste landfill within a 1-year period from a single household. The number 25 was chosen because under CERCLA the reportable
quantity (RQ) for PCBs is 1 pound (40 CFR 302.4). If an estimate of approximately 2/3 ounce of PCBs in each small capacitor
is used, 25 small capacitors equals just over 1 pound or the RQ for CERCLA. This number could be lower, such as 10 ballasts
within a 1&hyph;year period as the petitioners suggested or higher, such as 3,000 per month which approximates the
100 kg per month small quantity exemption under RCRA. EPA is seeking information on the number of fluorescent light
ballasts containing PCB Small Capacitors that should be allowed to be disposed of in a municipal solid waste landfill.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Finally, on a related issue, the petitioners indicated that fluorescent light ballasts containing PCB Small Capacitors
sent to municipal solid waste landfills do not remain intact and nonleaking once they are placed in the landfill. EPA
is seeking data indicating that the disposal practices at a municipal solid waste landfill, such as compaction, will
cause the PCBs to leak into the environment. If true, EPA is seeking data in support of statements that the PCBs leaking
from small capacitors in municipal solid waste landfills can create a risk to health and the environment through ground
water contamination. Such information should include the degree of risk reduction that could be achieved, the costs
of risk reduction methods, and the impacts of any regulation on the economy, small businesses and other affected entities.

 Large volume PCB liquids.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 EPA also received a request to address the issue of disposal options for large volume liquid PCB wastes. Under current
regulations at 761.60(a)(3), liquids at concentrations of 50 to 499 ppm may be disposed of in a high efficiency boiler
meeting the requirements of 761.60(a)(3)(iii), in an incinerator meeting the requirements of 761.70, or a chemical
waste landfill (CWL) meeting the requirements of 761.75, if information is presented to the CWL owner or operator
that the fluid does not exceed 500 ppm and is not an ignitable waste as described in 761.75(b)(8)(iii). However, the
commenter was referring to industrial sludges at 500 ppm or greater that must be disposed of by incineration or by an
alternate method that has been demonstrated to be the equivalent of incineration. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In responding to a citizens petition under section 21 of TSCA that had been submitted to EPA on behalf of several potentially
responsible parties to a Superfund cleanup (Refs. 5 and 6), the Agency indicated that ``[a]s a matter of policy, EPA
in 1985 determined to treat industrial sludge similarly to PCB liquids.... Under this policy, PCB-Contaminated
industrial sludges may be placed in a TSCA landfill complying with 40 CFR 761.75, while sludges contaminated at greater
than 500 ppm must be disposed of in a TSCA incinerator complying with 40 CFR 761.70.'' 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
As discussed earlier in this rule (see the discussion on ``Large Volume PCB Wastes'' at Unit II.A. of this preamble),
EPA is proposing to consider the site-specific risk factors in determining the appropriate disposal mechanisms
for PCB remediation wastes, a category of wastes which includes industrial sludges.

 Abandonment and disposal of natural gas pipeline.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 There are approximately 1.5 million miles of natural gas pipeline in the United States, including approximately
275,000 miles of interstate transmission line with the remainder comprising local distribution systems. Several
thousands of miles of pipeline are removed from service every year for a variety of reasons. One commenter suggested
``that the regulations should allow for the abandonment in place of all distribution mains after removal of any liquids
by reasonable means and the sealing of the ends of each segment of pipe.'' This commenter also suggested that the disposal
requirements for drained hydraulic machinery and drained natural gas pipeline should be equivalent. Another commenter
stated that 761.60(b)(5)(ii), which addresses disposal of ``Other PCB Articles,'' should be revised to say ``the
handling, storage, and disposal of the drained article (gas pipeline) is not regulated.'' Moreover, one commenter
suggested EPA revise the definition for PCB Items ``so that natural gas pipelines can be regulated in a manner more
in line with the risks presented.'' 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
A review of the history of the regulation of PCBs in natural gas pipelines is needed to put these comments into perspective.
The use of PCBs in natural gas pipeline compressors and in the liquids found in natural gas pipeline is authorized at
concentrations below 50 ppm (761.30(i)). The current authorization does not extend to the use of PCBs in air compressor
units that are routinely found at natural gas compressor stations. EPA believes that the risk of exposure associated
with other PCB Articles such as hydraulic equipment are much different than the risk of exposure to the end-users of
natural gas containing PCBs or the reuse of pipeline containing PCBs. In a final rule published in the 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 -->
Federal Register
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 on May 31, 1979 (44 FR 31536), EPA authorized the use, including servicing, of PCBs in natural gas pipeline compressors
at levels above 50 ppm until May 1, 1980. The authorization was intended to give individuals time to drain and refill
these compressors with non-PCB fluid to further reduce the PCB concentration below 50 ppm. EPA determined that ``[b]ecause
of the small quantities and low concentrations of PCBs involved, ... this authorization will not result in exposure
to PCBs that presents an unreasonable risk to health or the environment.'' 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In 1981, EPA found that industry practices continued to result in the use of PCBs in at least 13 natural gas pipeline
transmission systems at concentrations above 50 ppm, and in some instances above 500 ppm, in violation of the PCB regulations.
To address the elevated levels of PCBs found in the pipeline systems, EPA implemented remedial plans with four basic
objectives: (1) To contain the contamination to limited areas of the transmission system; (2) to eliminate any further
entry of PCBs into the system; (3) to remove remaining PCB contamination from these systems; and (4) to ensure proper
handling of PCBs that were removed. Each of these 13 interstate pipelines were originally presumed to contain PCBs
at levels greater than 50 ppm. Data collected since a 1981 compliance program was implemented showed the levels to
be, in fact, greater than 500 ppm. This presumption did not extend to other interstate pipelines or to associated distribution
system pipelines. Further, on July 10, 1984 (49 FR 28185), EPA amended the regulations to allow the continued use of
PCBs at less than 50 ppm in the natural gas compressors and liquid of natural gas pipelines provided the compressors
are marked in accordance with 761.45(a). 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Therefore, commenters questioning the disposal requirements are advised that, when the natural gas pipeline has
been operated in compliance with the PCB use authorization (i.e., the compressor and liquids contain less than 50
ppm), the handling, storage, and disposal of these items are currently not regulated. Reuse of this pipeline, such
as for culverts, is not currently authorized by these rules; however, reuse of pipeline is specifically addressed
in Unit II.D.2.b. and generally addressed in Units II.A.5. and 6. of this preamble. Items containing PCBs at levels
of 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=6 f=2 -->
;
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
50 ppm are subject to the disposal requirements at 40 CFR 761.60. However, PCB-Contaminated Articles that have been
drained of all free flowing liquids could still be abandoned in place under proposed 761.60(b)(6)(ii), as under current
761.60(b)(5)(ii), but not used or reused. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Local distribution system pipe frequently shares public rights-of-way, thus underlying major public infrastructures
such as roadways, water lines, sewer lines, and telephone and electrical service lines. Unlike interstate transmission
lines, testing and removal of some distribution lines have a great potential for causing prolonged disruption of
other utilities sharing these rights-of-way. Today's proposal at 761.60(b)(5) would allow segments of either interstate
or distribution natural gas pipelines to be abandoned in place along these rights-of-way if certain activities were
undertaken to limit the risk of exposure. EPA believes that it is not a function of who owns the pipeline but rather how
disruptive a removal would be that is the determining factor for allowing abandonment in these circumstances. DOT
requires that natural gas pipeline abandoned in place must be disconnected from all sources and supplies of gas; purged
of gas (but not liquids); in the case of local distribution lines, physically disconnected from the customer; and
sealed at both ends (49 CFR 192.727). EPA believes that these requirements do not provide protection from exposure
to pipe containing PCBs, even of the small diameters routinely found in local distribution systems because the distribution
company may lose physical control of the pipeline containing PCBs after abandonment. EPA specifically requests
data on levels of PCB contamination in local distribution systems and the protection from exposure to PCBs afforded
by the DOT requirements for abandonment. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
EPA proposes at 761.60(b)(5)(i)(A), that when levels of PCB contamination cannot be determined because condensate
samples cannot be collected and the pipe is too small (having an inside diameter of 4 inches or less) to be accurately
wipe sampled, the pipe may be abandoned in place if it is either filled to 50 percent of its volume with grout or high density
polyurethane foam and sealed closed at each end, or sealed closed at each end and included in a public service notification
program, such as a ``one-call'' underground utility warning program under DOT regulations at 49 CFR 192.614. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The proposal also provides a series of options for the removal with subsequent disposal or decontamination of pipeline
containing PCBs and defines procedures for determining the level of contamination and whether the pipeline contains
liquid. PCB-Contaminated natural gas pipeline, i.e., pipeline containing or contacting PCBs at concentrations
of 50 &hyph;

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
, 937 F.2d 649 (D.C. Cir. 1991)], is proposing to clarify the disposal requirements relating to solvents used in decontamination
procedures. Current regulations at 761.79(a) explicitly require the disposal of solvents used to decontaminate
PCB containers in a TSCA approved facility once the PCB concentration in the solvent reaches 50 ppm PCBs. Section 761.79
does not address the disposal requirements for solvents used to decontaminate that do not reach 50 ppm. Existing rules
at 761.1(b) require solvents used in decontamination to be disposed of as PCBs regardless of the final concentration
of PCBs in the solvent. Such solvents have been in contact with PCBs and as such are regarded as containing the concentration
of the original PCBs because of the principle of anti-dilution. The PCB rules currently contain no other provisions
for decontamination; however, EPA has approved various decontamination-like activities under 761.60(e). PCB
disposal approvals for decontamination-like activities, issued under 761.60(e), specify disposal requirements
for solvents. In the Rollins Circuit Court decision, the disposal requirements for solvents that contain less than
50 ppm PCB used to decontaminate PCB containers were found to be unclear. In order to clarify this situation, EPA is
proposing to amend the provisions at 761.79 to allow hydrocarbon solvents containing less than 50 ppm PCBs to be used
in accordance with the provisions for used oil as outlined in 761.20(e) or to be decontaminated themselves through
processes such as filtration.

 Disposal of waste generated during the chemical analysis of PCBs.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 Chemical analysis is needed to determine PCB concentrations for the purposes of determining compliance with the
PCB regulations; characterize PCB contamination; determine the effectiveness of various decontamination and
treatment technologies; and determine PCB levels in humans and their food chain. The chemical analysis of PCBs includes
sample preparation, sample extraction, extract concentration, extract cleanup, addition of PCB standards, and
instrumental analysis. There are several possible wastestreams resulting from the chemical analysis of PCBs: excess
sample, potentially contaminated drying agent (anhydrous sodium sulphate), extract solvent removed during extract
concentration (acetone, hexane, methylene chloride, etc.), cleanup column packing materials (alumina, florisil,
etc.), cleanup liquids (concentrated sulfuric acid), glassware, filtering materials, extracted sample material,
and excess extract. In addition, analytical instrumentation is contaminated and therefore regulated if regulated
PCBs are analyzed. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The relatively small amount of PCBs extracted in a sample is often diluted significantly in most potential laboratory
wastes, and most wastes that cannot be recycled contain materials that should absorb PCBs. Extraction of small amounts
of PCBs resulting from PCB analysis would likely be more burdensome than disposal in a controlled disposal facility
and would result in less reduction in risk. Therefore, EPA is proposing at 761.64 special disposal provisions for
laboratory waste. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
All samples, including extracted sample material, would remain regulated for disposal, but could be returned to
the site of generation for disposal according to the concentration measured in the sample. EPA is also proposing to
permit, under certain conditions, the recycling for reuse of limited quantities of organic solvents used in the chemical
analysis process described above. This change would result in cost savings to the laboratory by not having to replace
used solvent, that could otherwise be safely and economically recycled by distillation within the laboratory, and
would also result in minimization of laboratory waste solvents for disposal. In addition, EPA is proposing to allow
the disposal of small quantities of non-liquid waste according to their existing (or presumed) concentration even
though that concentration is known to be the result of dilution from performance of chemical analysis. EPA believes
that the relatively small quantity of these wastes which are generated, their low concentrations of PCBs in non-liquid
materials, and the significant quantity of materials in the non-liquid waste which would absorb PCBs present make
disposal of these materials in a RCRA approved or TSCA approved landfill a safe and economical option.

 h. Transboundary movement of PCBs for disposal.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 EPA periodically receives requests from individuals wishing to import or export PCBs for disposal. Current regulations
at 40 CFR 761.20(b)(2), promulgated under section 6(e)(1) of TSCA, authorize the import or export for disposal of
PCBs only at concentrations less than 50 ppm. EPA believes there are 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
instances where the import or export for disposal of PCBs at 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
higher concentrations would not pose an unreasonable risk of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
injury to health or the environment. EPA therefore proposes to 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
amend 761.20(b)(2) and add 761.20(b)(3) to create certain 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
categorical exceptions to the general ban on import for disposal 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
of PCBs at 50 ppm or greater and to clarify what constitutes 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
import or export for purposes of this regulation. This proposal 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
would also establish a petition procedure under proposed 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
761.20(b)(4) and (c)(3) under which other imports and exports 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
for disposal could be allowed on a case-by-case basis. This 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
section of the proposal would not alter the current ban on import 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
or export of PCBs at 50 ppm or greater for purposes other than 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
disposal (including import for use, reuse, or recycling), or 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
affect the meaning of the terms ``import'' or ``export'' for any 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
other provisions of TSCA. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
 When EPA addressed the issue of import and export for 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
disposal in 1979, it noted that regulation of these types of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
activities could be accomplished under TSCA section 6(e)(1), 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
which governs disposal activities, or alternatively under section 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
6(e)(3), which governs manufacture and import activities (44 FR 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
31514, 31526 (May 31, 1979)). Based upon the authority in 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
section 6(e)(1), EPA elected to issue comprehensive regulations 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
that temporarily authorized the import and export of PCBs for 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
disposal, otherwise known as the ``Open Border Policy.'' EPA 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
decided not to extend these regulations in 1980 and they expired 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(45 FR 29115 (May 1, 1980)). 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In 1984, EPA issued the current PCB regulations that address 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
import and export for disposal (40 CFR 761.20(b) and 761.60(h)). 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Section 761.60(h) provides that the import and export of PCBs and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
PCB Items for purposes of disposal are regulated under section 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
761.20. Section 761.20(b)(2) authorizes only the import or 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
export for disposal of PCBs at concentrations of less than 50 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
ppm. The current rules do not authorize import or export for 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
disposal of PCBs at higher concentrations. In the absence of a 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
general rule that allows the import or export for disposal of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
such PCBs, the only way that such wastes may currently be 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
imported or exported is if EPA grants an exemption pursuant to 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
TSCA section 6(e)(3). 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
This rule is designed to control the transboundary movement of PCB waste in a manner consistent with the Basel Convention
on the Control of Transboundary Movement of Hazardous Wastes and their Disposal. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
EPA is requesting comment on the circumstances under which 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the U.S. border should be opened to transboundary shipments of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
PCBs for disposal. The options range from allowing all imports 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
for disposal under section 6(e) to maintaining the current closed border 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
status, and might include opening the border to PCBs from a 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
limited geographic area such as the Great Lakes drainage basin. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Today's proposal, if finalized, would retain the general 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
prohibitions on import and export of PCB wastes at concentrations 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
of 50 ppm or greater, with certain exceptions described below. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 Proposed 761.20(b)(2) would allow three

exceptions to the general prohibition on import of PCBs for 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
disposal. Proposed 761.20(b)(3) would clarify what 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
constitutes import for purposes of this regulation. EPA could 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
add categorical exceptions to proposed 761.20(b)(2) and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(b)(3) should the need arise in the future.

 Because the Administrator has made the finding that PCBs at concentrations less than 50 ppm present no unreasonable

 TSCA and the regulations issued thereunder at 40 CFR Part 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
761 regulate the manufacture, import, distribution, processing, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
use, storage, and disposal of PCB waste in the United States. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The terms ``United States'' and ``States'' are defined at sections 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
3(13) and 3(14) of TSCA to include ``any state, D.C., Puerto Rico, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Virgin Islands, Guam, the Canal Zone, American Samoa, Northern 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Mariana Islands, or any other territory or possession of the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
United States.'' TSCA does not define imports specifically, but 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
section 13 of TSCA requires the Secretary of the Treasury to 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
refuse entry into the customs territory of the United States (as 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
defined in general headnote 2 of the Tariff Schedules of the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
United States) of any chemical substance, mixture, or article 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
offered for entry if it fails to comply with any rule under TSCA. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In the Tariff Schedules, ``customs territory of the United States'' 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
is defined as ``any State of the United States, the District of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Columbia, and Puerto Rico.'' Thus, a problem arises when a 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
territory or possession which is outside the customs territory of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the United States attempts to ship PCB wastes back into the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
customs territory of the United States for disposal. Any such 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
transfer of such PCB wastes at concentrations of 50 ppm or 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
greater would be considered a prohibited import under existing 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
regulations. This is problematic because most United States 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
territories and possessions outside the customs territory do not 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
have adequate disposal facilities. Since PCBs persist in the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
environment, improper disposal of PCBs in those territories or 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
possessions could create an unreasonable risk to health or the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
environment in the territory or possession of the United States. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Therefore, EPA proposes to allow transfers of PCBs from United 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
States territories or possessions that are outside the customs 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
territory of the United States into the customs territory of the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
United States for disposal.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
 Imports of PCBs for disposal where EPA determines that 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
it is in the interests of the United States and will not result 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
in unreasonable risks to health or the environment. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 In addition to the categorical exceptions listed above, there may be instances in which it would be in the interests
of the United States to allow import of PCBs for disposal. This might be the case where PCBs were located outside the
United 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
States, but in close proximity to the United States, and adequate 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
disposal facilities were not available in the country in which 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
they were located. Import of the PCBs into the United States for 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
disposal might be in the interests of the United States to 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
mitigate an unreasonable risk to health or the environment in the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
United States that could not be mitigated by other means. It 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
might be in the interests of the United States to allow import of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
PCBs for disposal to implement a federal law such as CERCLA, or 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
to carry out United States obligations under a treaty or other 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
international agreement. EPA would not be inclined to find that 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
import for disposal was in the interests of the United States 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
solely because disposal of the PCBs in this country was less 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
expensive. EPA proposes to allow imports for disposal that are 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
in the interests of the United States on a case-by-case basis 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
where they would not pose an unreasonable risk of injury to 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
health or the environment. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Under its section 6(e)(1) authority to regulate disposal, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
EPA proposes to allow these case-by-case exceptions to the ban on 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
import for disposal of PCBs at concentrations of 50 ppm or 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
greater at EPA's initiative or in response to a petition. Under 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
proposed 761.20(b)(4), any person may petition EPA for an 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
exception to the prohibition on import for disposal, and EPA may 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
grant such an exception if it finds that to do so would be in the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
interests of the United States and would not result in 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
unreasonable risk of injury to health or the environment. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Petitions would be filed with the Director, Chemical 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Management Division. The Director has the authority to issue 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
TSCA PCB disposal approvals in certain instances and is 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
responsible for coordination and oversight of PCB disposal 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
activities in the United States. Therefore, the Director is in 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the most advantageous position to require proper disposal of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
imported PCBs. Petitions would have to be submitted on an 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
individual basis for each individual that would be subject to the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
exception. If EPA determined that it was appropriate to create a 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
categorical exception, it could do so by adding through 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
rulemaking to the categorical exceptions proposed at 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
761.20(b)(2) and (b)(3). Information to be included in the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
petition is specified at proposed 761.20(b)(4)(i) through (vii). 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The petitioner would be notified of EPA's decision by letter. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
To implement the proposed 761.20(b)(2) through (4), 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
EPA is also proposing at 761.20(b)(5) that all PCBs at 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
concentrations greater than or equal to 50 ppm that are imported 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
for disposal must be disposed of in an EPA designated facility 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
which has a TSCA PCB disposal approval. Each facility's TSCA PCB 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
disposal approval would have to contain specific conditions 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
addressing at a minimum its designation to receive specified 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
shipments of imported PCBs for disposal, analytical data on 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
wastes to be imported including their compatibility with the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
facility's approved waste disposal techniques, prior notification 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
and certification to EPA of adequate disposal capacity, use of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the manifest system, provisions for financial responsibility for 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the imported PCBs from the port of entry through final disposal, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
appropriate recordkeeping for these activities, and any other 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
conditions that EPA found were necessary to ensure that the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
import and disposal of PCBs did not present an unreasonable risk 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
of injury to health or the environment. Since EPA cannot easily 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
reach foreign generators of imported PCBs to enforce liability 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
provisions of TSCA or other Federal statutes and cannot be 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
assured that shipments of imported PCBs could be returned to 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
their country of origin if they could not be disposed of at the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
designated facility, conditions would be included in disposal 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
approvals to address these situations. Imported PCBs could also 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
be decontaminated under the proposed changes to 761.79. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
However, the PCBs would have to be imported to a commercial 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
storage facility which had a PCB commercial storage approval, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
unless exempt, including special approval conditions for imported 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
wastes, as noted above.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 When EPA announced the expiration of the Open 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Border Policy in 1980 it stated, with regard to exports, that it 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
would not grant an exemption unless the nation to which the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
export was destined had proper facilities for ultimate disposal 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(See 45 FR 29115). EPA believes that export of PCBs to other 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
countries needs to be limited so as not to pose a risk of injury to
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
health or the environment in those countries and that to the maximum 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
extent practicable, each nation should manage its own waste within its 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
own borders. Therefore, EPA is proposing at 761.20(c)(3) to 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
allow export for disposal of PCB waste at concentrations of 50 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
ppm or greater on a case-by-case basis unless EPA has reason to believe that the PCBs in question will not be properly
managed, where the receiving 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
country has an international agreement consistent with the international obligations of the United States relating
to transboundary movements of PCBs and their disposal, with the U.S. Government concerning such exports; the government
of the receiving country certifies to EPA that it has received accurate and complete information about the waste,
consents to receive it, and has adequate disposal facilities to assure proper management; and the exporter identifies
waste containing liquid PCBs or PCB-containing electrical 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
equipment. As an example, vessels are sometimes exported for 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
salvage of the considerable amounts of metal they contain. PCBs 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
present in integral components of the ships, such as wire cable 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
or air handling system gaskets, could be exported with the ship 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
under conditions specified in the export approval. EPA could 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
require as a condition of approval for export that PCBs found in 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
large capacitors, transformers, and hydraulic or heat transfer 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
fluids, be removed prior to export for disposal. EPA could allow 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
such exports for disposal on its own initiative or in response to 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
a petition. Other information that would have to be included in 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the petition is set out at proposed 761.20(c)(3).

 Transport of PCB waste generated in the United States

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 The proposal would clarify that PCB waste generated in the United States may be transported through a foreign country
and returned to the United States for disposal. For example, PCB 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
waste generated in Michigan could be transported across Canada 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
for disposal in New York. Any residual PCB waste resulting from 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the cleanup of spills that might occur in transit could also be 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
brought into the United States for disposal. Otherwise, it would 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
be impractical and inefficient to transport PCBs generated in 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
certain parts of the United States to nearby United States 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
disposal facilities. This provision is included in 761.20(b)(3) 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
as a clarification. For purposes of this regulation, EPA 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

remained under U. S. Government control since the time of

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 In conjunction with U. S. Government operations, PCBs may be taken to United States facilities abroad for use. Because
these PCBs have always been the property of the United States, and because disposal facilities for these wastes might

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

 Landfilling of liquid PCBs.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 EPA proposes to remove the provisions allowing for the disposal of liquid PCBs, which have been stabilized on-site
prior to disposal, at a chemical waste landfill, 761.60(a)(2)(ii), 761.60(a)(3)(ii), and 761.75(b)(8)(ii). These
provisions were established in the May 31, 1979 rulemaking, since at the time of the rulemaking there was a limited
number of incinerators permitted to burn PCB waste and disposal capacity was a concern. Currently, and as can be reasonably
expected in the future, the amount of low concentration PCB liquids anticipated to be designated for disposal and
in storage for disposal can easily be accommodated within the existing and anticipated future PCB disposal technologies
other than landfilling. The existing PCB disposal and storage for disposal regulations and the amendments proposed
in this rulemaking are expected to accommodate the surplus in the disposal capacity supply. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Further support for this deletion of a disposal option for liquid PCBs having low PCB concentrations is the prohibition
on landfilling liquid hazardous wastes containing PCBs under the RCRA land disposal restrictions at 40 CFR 268.42.

. This change would eliminate the time-consuming process of obtaining an R&amp;D approval in order to engage in limited
R&amp;D into PCB disposal. R&amp;D for PCB disposal not conforming with the limitations of this section would require
written approval or written waiver of the requirements of a 761.60(e), 761.60(i)(2), or 761.70(a) or (b) approval
by the Regional Administrator in the EPA Region where the R&amp;D would occur. Persons engaged in research and development
into PCB disposal technologies would now be required to obtain an EPA identification number. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
EPA proposes at 761.60(j) a self-implementing approval for research and development (R&amp;D) for PCB disposal
activities. Limitations are proposed for the amount of PCB material disposed of, the concentration of the PCBs disposed
of, the total amount of PCBs, and the duration of the R&amp;D for disposal activity. All treated and untreated PCB materials
from a PCB R&amp;D for disposal activity would be required to be disposed of according to 761.60(a)-(e).

 Definition of R&amp;D for PCB Disposal.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 An individual engaged in R&amp;D for PCB disposal activities is someone who is not accepting PCB waste on a commercial
scale; the person is involved solely in the R&amp;D for preliminary investigation and limited scale up of PCB disposal
technologies and may or may not possess a TSCA PCB R&amp;D Approval issued according to 761.60(e), 761.60(i)(2),
or 761.70(a) or (b).

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
 Limitations.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 EPA is proposing at 761.60(j) that the maximum quantity used annually under this exemption for PCB treatability study
samples be 70 cubic feet for solid material or 500 gallons for liquid material. This should be a sufficient amount of
material for conducting small-scale treatability studies. If additional material is needed to conduct the study,
the Regional Administrator may at his or her discretion grant requests on a case-by-case basis for quantity limits
in excess of those specified or require a formal R&amp;D approval if the increased quantity could present an unreasonable
risk to health or the environment. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In addition to a quantity cut-off, EPA is proposing at 761.60(j) to limit the maximum concentration for PCB waste that
is used in a treatability study to 10,000 ppm for those utilizing the 500 gallon or 70 cubic feet volume cap or 1 kilogram
(kg) of pure PCB waste annually at the facility. It has been EPA's experience in the past in reviewing applications
for R&amp;D approvals and in discussions with those in the waste treatment field, that it is rare that one would need
a sample that contains more than 10,000 ppm PCBs to conduct a small-scale treatability study. The concentration limits
are also proposed based on the Agency's concern with the potential risks associated with the distribution in commerce
(without a manifest) and handling of high concentration PCBs. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
EPA is also limiting the approvals under proposed 761.60(j) to one calendar year to evaluate the progress and scope
of the R&amp;D and to plan for potential formal permitting of successful technologies.

 Permitting and exceeding the limitations.

 Under the proposal, a the laboratory conducting the treatability study conforms to the criteria of 761.60(j), then
it is not subject to the permitting requirements of 761.60(e), 761.60(i)(2), or 761.70(a) or (b). The Agency feels
that the criteria in proposed 761.60(j) coupled with the applicable provisions of OSHA regulations at 29 CFR part
1910 provide adequate oversight and protection to health and the environment to forego the need for formal permitting.
The Regional Administrator or Director, CMD would, however, have the authority even in cases where the R&amp;D activity
would not exceed the maximum allowable volume (500 gallons of liquid or 70 cubic feet of solid) or the maximum allowable
concentration (10,000 ppm or 1 kg of pure PCB), to require the requestor to submit a formal permit application if the
disposal activity could present an unreasonable risk of injury to health or the environment. Under proposed 761.60(j),
the Regional Administrator in the Region in which the R&amp;D disposal activity is proposed would have to be informed
in writing at least 30 days prior to the commencement of the disposal activity.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The following issues were identified in the ANPRM as items where changes may be appropriate. These revisions include
providing clarification on certain provisions (e.g., the 1&hyph;year time limit for storage and disposal requirement)
and amending the regulations where appropriate, eliminating seemingly duplicative requirements (e.g., marking),
and creating new provisions to promote efficiency in disposal operations (e.g., temporary storage of greater than
500 ppm PCB liquids). 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

A. Marking 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The regulations at 761.40(b) and (e) essentially express the same requirements with regard to the marking of transport
vehicles when loaded with PCBs in the liquid phase at concentrations of 50 ppm or greater. In the ANPRM, EPA solicited
comments on the best remedy for this regulatory duplication. In response to the ANPRM, commenters expressed general
support for EPA's overall objective to clarify the language and eliminate duplication in the marking regulations.
Several commenters suggested that both 761.40(b) and (e) be deleted and totally rewritten. Other suggestions included
combining the paragraphs, rewriting both subsections, or deleting one and updating the other. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In today's proposal, EPA proposes to eliminate this duplication by combining references to the marking requirement
for transport vehicles at 761.40(b) and (e) under proposed paragraph (d), thus leaving the requirements for the remaining
PCB Items under paragraph (e). This amendment would not result in any substantive change. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Further, EPA has determined that Large Low Voltage Capacitors often are not identified and disposed of properly at
the time of removal, because they are not required to be marked while in use. Therefore, EPA is proposing to strengthen
the marking requirements for Large Low Voltage Capacitors to include those still in use. Because of these identification
and disposal concerns, the Agency is proposing at 761.40(k) that all PCB Equipment in use containing PCB transformers
or PCB Large Capacitors be marked with the mark ML. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Agency is also aware of reports that PCB Capacitors were not marked because they were assumed not to contain PCBs.
To clarify what capacitors must be assumed to contain PCBs, EPA is proposing to amend the definition of ``Capacitor''
in 761.3 to clarify that a capacitor whose PCB concentration is unknown generally must be assumed to contain 500 ppm
or greater PCBs. This should make it evident to readers that this rule applies to the marking, use, and recordkeeping
requirements, and not just disposal.

B. Department of Transportation Containers for Storage of PCB Waste 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Currently, the regulations at 761.60(b)(2)(vi) and 761.65(c)(6) specify the use of Department of Transportation
(DOT) specification containers for PCB storage and disposal. Section 761.65(c)(7)allows liquid PCB waste to be
storedin containers that are larger than the DOT containers specified at 761.65(c)(6), provided they meet OSHA requirements
(761.65(c)(7)(i)). In addition, a Spill Prevention Control and Countermeasure (SPCC) Plan must be prepared and
implemented in order for these larger containers to be used. For non-liquid PCB waste, containers larger than those
specified in 761.65(c)(6) may be used, if they provide as much protection against leaks and exposure as the DOT containers,
and they are of the same relative strength and durability. In short, the current regulations require the most durable
containers be used for storing and/or transporting PCBs, which in most cases, and in particular when storing PCB/radioactive
waste, may not be the best alternative (See discussion at Unit II.C._PCB/Radioactive Waste). 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
EPA is proposing to amend 761.60(b)(2)(vi) and 761.65(c)(6) by deferring to the DOT container requirements for the
storage and transportation of PCBs. EPA proposes to eliminate all citations to specific container type and to cross
reference the new performance-based DOT container requirements set forth in the DOT Hazardous Material Regulations
(HMR) at 49 CFR Parts 171&hyph;180. EPA regulates PCBs at a much lower concentration than DOT. Therefore, EPA would
also like to emphasize that although some material may not be subject to DOT regulations, part 761 would still require
these materials to be packaged in accordance with the DOT regulations, that is, in DOT authorized containers. PCBs
are shown in the Hazardous Materials table at 49 CFR 172.101, in Packing Group II. However, under those regulations
PCBs that are transported by highway or rail need only be packaged pursuant to Packing Group III. PCB/radioactive,
PCB/fissionable material, PCB/mixed waste, and PCB/hazardous waste not packaged in accordance with the HMR are
not allowed to be transported. Additionally, readers are advised that the HMR as amended on December 21, 1990 (55 FR
52402) prohibits the construction of DOT specification packaging previously designated for the storage of PCB waste
(i.e., DOT Specification 5, 5B, 6D, 17C, 17E, and 17H containers) effective October 1, 1994. Further, transportation
of PCBs in these outdated DOT specification containers is not authorized beyond September 30, 1996. Although most
commenters agreed with EPA's decision to defer to DOT, one commenter suggested that EPA continue to list all containers
authorized by DOT. However, such an approach would defeat EPA's objectives in amending the PCB rules which are to provide
flexibility to industry and to minimize the resource burden associated with updating the PCB regulations each time
DOT modifies its requirements.

C. Definition of a PCB Transformer and PCB-Contaminated Electrical Equipment 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The proposed amendment to the definition of a PCB Transformer at 761.3 provides: ``PCB Transformer means any transformer
that contains 500 ppm PCBs or greater. A transformer is a PCB Transformer if: the nameplate indicates that the transformer
contains PCB dielectric fluid; the owner or operator has any reason to believe that the transformer contains PCB dielectric
fluid; or the transformer dielectric fluid has been tested and found to contain PCBs at 500 ppm or greater. A transformer
is assumed to be a PCB Transformer if: the transformer does not have a nameplate; records do not exist that indicate
the type of dielectric fluid; or records do not exist that indicate the PCB concentration.'' In order to clarify the
current definitions of ``PCB-Contaminated Electrical Equipment'' (specifically PCB-Contaminated Transformer
within this definition) at 761.3, EPA is proposing incorporate into this definition the provisions of the ``assumption
rule'' in this preamble to the PCB to the PCB Ban rule (44 FR 31517, May 31, 1979).
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
EPA inspectors have suspected that some owners of transformers are abusing the ``assumption rule'' to avoid the stricter
disposal requirements of 761.60. An example of such an avoidance technique is the removal of the manufacturer's nameplate
or other identifying information that could be used to classify a transformer as PCB. Additionally, the possibility
exists that a transformer may have been serviced with fluid containing 500 ppm PCBs or greater. For purposes of clarification,
``records'' as used above refers to servicing records, manufacturers certifications and/or other data that would
indicate or impact PCB concentration. Generally, commenters expressed support for EPA's effort to clarify the existing
definition of a PCB Transformer. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In addition, the current definition of PCB-Contaminated Electrical Equipment at 761.3 which includes ``oil-filled
electrical equipment,'' has been misinterpreted to mean that a transformer with any oil in it could be assumed to be
PCB-Contaminated (50 to 499 ppm). To further clarify this definition, the Agency is proposing to add the word ``mineral''
before the words ``oil filled''. In addition, language would be added to this definition which states that ``a transformer
is assumed to contain PCBs at 500 ppm or greater, if it is an untested mineral oil transformer and reasons exist to believe
that the transformer was at any time serviced with fluid containing PCBs at 500 ppm or greater.'' Historically, mineral
oil transformers encompassed the vast majority of non-askarel transformers; however, over time the types of non-askarel
transformers have expanded to include, for example, silicone filled transformers. Adding this clarification would
reestablish the Agency's intent when this definition was added to the regulation in August of 1982 (46 FR 37342) that
mineral oil filled transformers are assumed to be PCB-Contaminated (50 to 499 ppm) 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Some commenters suggested that instead of amending the definition, the Agency should consider requiring that these
units be tested prior to disposal. Others commented that EPA should provide immunity from enforcement action to owners
who assumed their oil-filled electrical equipment was PCB-Contaminated Electrical Equipment when it was later
determined that the transformer contained PCBs at 500 ppm or greater. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
While the costs of testing have decreased since 1979, EPA is not proposing to change its long standing policy, which
does not require testing transformers prior to disposal, while the equipment is in use. Nonetheless, owners of electrical
equipment containing PCBs should consider verifying the concentration prior to disposal to avoid violations of
TSCA. In addition, EPA is not proposing to issue a blanket exemption from enforcement action for use of a mineral oil
transformers assumed to contain less than 500 ppm PCBs but later found to contain PCBs at 500 ppm or greater. The regulations
at 761.30(a)(1)(xv) currently describe procedures for bringing such transformers into compliance with the use
authorization provisions. For example, in order to qualify for the current use authorization, all PCB Transformers
were required to have been registered with fire response personnel by December 1, 1985 (761.30(a)(1)(vi)). PCB transformers
erroneously assumed to have been contaminated at less than 500 ppm PCBs must be registered within 30 days of discovery
of the actual contamination level with the required fire response personnel (761.30(a)(1)(xv)(D). If it cannot
be demonstrated (e.g., by the production of the receipt from a registered letter used to register the transformer
and signed by the fire response personnel) that, this registration has taken place, then that PCB Transformer is not
authorized for use under 761.30. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Agency is seeking information regarding numbers of small transformers or other electrical equipment that contains
PCBs. These small transformers or other types of small electrical equipment generally do not have nameplates and
are not easily sampled. Some examples of this type of equipment are: potential transformers, current transformers,
instrument transformers, grounding transformers, voltage transformers, and ignition transformers. These small
transformers can range in size from several inches to several feet in height. Such small transformers can be filled
with oil, epoxy, or tar-like potting compounds that contain PCBs, or they could be ``dry''. Since these small transformers
generally do not have a nameplate, under the proposed amendment to 761.3 they would have to be assumed to be PCB Transformers
and would be subject to the use requirements at 761.30(a) and the disposal requirements at 761.60(a). 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Agency is also soliciting comments regarding the disposal requirements that could be imposed on these small transformers
or other similar types of small electrical equipment. Their disposal requirements could resemble those for small
capacitors (e.g., 3 pounds of dielectric fluid (761.60(b)(2)(ii)) or could be expanded to include the size (physical
dimensions) or the total weight of the equipment as well. Such small transformers or similar small electrical equipment,
meeting the size or weight conditions, could be authorized for disposal in an approved chemical waste landfill under
761.75, or if less stringent disposal was deemed protective, in a municipal solid waste landfill.

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Drained PCB-Contaminated Electrical Equipment is unregulated for disposal under the existing regulations at 761.60(b)(4)
and may be salvaged through smelting, a process recognized by EPA as an acceptable form of disposal when certain conditions
are met. EPA solicited comments in the ANPRM on whether the Agency should consider amending the regulations for the
disposal of drained PCB-Contaminated Electrical Equipment to ensure that the equipment is properly disposed of
and is not illegally reused. Possible remedies such as decontamination and stricter controls to ensure that units
were completely drained were not well received by commenters. In particular, most commenters stated that the anecdotal
information that drained PCB-Contaminated Electrical Equipment carcasses were used for barbecue grills reflected
isolated instances of non-compliance. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Considering the low potential exposure to humans and the environment and the valuable metals that could be salvaged
for recycling, EPA is proposing to modify the disposal requirements at 761.60(b)(4) for drained PCB-Contaminated
Electrical Equipment by including this equipment under the proposed general ban against open burning of PCBs and
allowing disposal only in facilities that are permitted, licensed, or registered by a State to manage municipal or
industrial wastes (excluding thermal treatment units), in an industrial furnace or in a TSCA approved disposal facility
(See Unit II.B.2. of this preamble). Finally, EPA also proposes to add language to 761.60(b)(4) which states that
for a period of not less than 48 hours, equipment should be allowed to drain, so that as much liquid as possible is removed
from the equipment to further reduce PCB content prior to disposal.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Under current rules, PCB Items with concentrations of 50 ppm or greater, sold before July 1, 1979, for purposes other
than resale may be distributed in commerce in a totally enclosed manner (761.20(c)(1)). While under 761.20(c)(1),
totally enclosed PCB Items such as transformers, and Large High and Low Voltage Capacitors 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=6 f=2 -->
;
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
50 ppm (as defined in 761.3) may be distributed in commerce (e.g., sold), EPA requested comment in the ANPRM on the requirement
that records be maintained on these transactions. Generally, commenters were very supportive of the requirement
that records be maintained to document the distribution in commerce of these items. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
With the proposed recordkeeping requirement at 761.180(a)(2)(ix), EPA seeks to prevent illegal disposal of PCB
Items, including PCB and PCB-contaminated transformers and Large Capacitors, by those who explain the disappearance
of such items by claiming a sale has occurred. To minimize the potential for illegal disposal, EPA is proposing that
the name, address, and phone number of the parties to which the item was transferred, the date of transfer, and the identifying
number of the item be recorded in the annual document log for any distribution in commerce of a PCB Item (excluding small
capacitors) with a concentration of 50 ppm or greater. In addition, EPA suggests that summary information relevant
to the equipment (e.g., PCB content, servicing, and inspection records) and its compliance with applicable sections
of part 761 be passed on to the new owner. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
EPA had anticipated in the ANPRM that this recordkeeping requirement would be imposed pursuant to a sale. However,
in order to avoid claims that the transaction is exempt from the proposed recordkeeping requirement because it involved
no transfer of money, EPA is proposing to require that any transfer of ownership resulting in the transformer or other
PCB Item being distributed in commerce, be included in the recordkeeping requirement. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The intent behind this proposed recordkeeping requirement is to identify instances of illegal disposal hidden behind
the guise of a transfer of ownership. As such, EPA is seeking to require additional information on transactions which
result in the removal of the transformers and capacitors from the property. In this proposal, EPA would not require
the annual document log to identify the transfer of ownership of PCB Items (excluding small capacitors) with a concentration
of 50 ppm or greater when that transfer was included in a real estate transfer. For example, a company sells a warehouse
and the surrounding property. As long as the transformers and capacitors were transferred in the same transaction
as the real estate, a separate log of the transaction would not be necessary. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
A few commenters to the ANPRM suggested that the sale of totally enclosed electrical equipment should be banned outright.
EPA believes that the sale or transfer of totally enclosed PCB Items should not be banned and that there is still a legitimate
need for such equipment. However, EPA believes that additional controls are needed to ensure proper disposal of such
equipment. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
One commenter stated that a recordkeeping requirement would be impossible since not all PCB Items (e.g., PCB-Contaminated
Transformers, or Large Capacitors) are marked with a serial number. Although EPA proposes that the records include
the serial number of the equipment, the absence of a serial number should not preclude EPA from tracing an illegal disposal.
Therefore, EPA is proposing that any internal identification number that the company uses to identify the specific
PCB Item be included in the records. Any facility with PCB Items (excluding small capacitors) with a concentration
of 50 ppm or greater not equipped with manufacturer identification numbers should develop some mechanism for identifying
those pieces of equipment for activities such as maintenance or quarterly inspections. The proposal would require
permanent marking, such as engraving of an internal identifying number in a prominent location on the equipment,
as a means of identifying this equipment. Absent a manufacturer's identification, the company's own identification
number would have to be documented on the records. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Several commenters recommended that the recordkeeping requirement be included in the annual record requirements
at 761.180(a). EPA agrees that this would be an appropriate method of maintaining the records of a transfer of ownership
of a PCB Item (excluding small capacitors) with a concentration of 50 ppm or greater. Therefore, EPA is proposing to
implement this requirement by adding paragraph (ix) to 761.180(a)(2).

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
In attempting to provide more consistency with other Federal statutes, EPA solicited comments on whether 761.125(a)(1)
should be modified to the new reporting requirement to the National Response Center. Changing the notice requirements
from 10 pounds to 1 pound or more of pure PCBs, would reflect changes made to the reportable quantity (RQ) under CERCLA
at 40 CFR part 302. In addition to seeking comments on this issue, the Agency restated its objective in establishing
the TSCA PCB Spill Cleanup Policy of April 2, 1987; i.e., to provide guidance for the cleanup of recent (after May 4,
1987) or fresh spills. Commenters conveyed general support for changing the National Response Center RQ to 1 pound
or more of pure PCBs. However, some suggested addressing old spills by applying the TSCA PCB Spill Cleanup Policy,
while others recommended changes to the Regional reporting requirement. In considering these options, EPA concluded
it is inappropriate to change the current policy to address these issues at this time. EPA's objective in initiating
this rulemaking is to provide flexibility and to remove redundancies without weakening the existing policy. Finally,
further discussion of EPA's position regarding the remediation of old spills can be found by referring to Unit II.A.,
``Large Volume PCB Wastes'' in this notice.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
 Indefinite storage of PCB Articles designated for reuse.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 EPA regulations specifically state at 40 CFR 761.65(a) that any PCB Articles or PCB Containers that are stored for
disposal shall be removed from storage and disposed of within 1 year from the date when it was first placed into storage.
However, there currently is no comparable provision in the regulations that addresses the length of time a PCB Article
may be stored for reuse. Further, EPA has been made aware of situations where PCB Transformers and PCB-Contaminated
Transformers have been held ``in storage for reuse'' well beyond a time when it is reasonable to expect the equipment
could be reused. This storage is being done under the pretext that the equipment is being retained as ``spares'' for
critical components of existing electrical systems or that at some future date the owner will service the unit. It
was not EPA's intent to allow PCB Articles that clearly could not be reused due to their state of disrepair, and therefore
should be disposed of, to remain in storage for ``reuse.'' This activity constitutes illegal disposal and creates
additional risks of environmental exposure to PCBs while the equipment is ``in storage for reuse.'' 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
EPA is aware, however, that there are many legitimate instances which warrant the storage of PCB equipment for many
years for the purpose of reuse as spares for critical components of electrical systems. These are typically intact
and nonleaking PCB Articles which are treated as if they were in service. Many comments received in response to the
ANPRM suggested that limiting storage for reuse would in effect amount to a new use restriction without any apparent
basis from the standpoint of protection of health and the environment. Nevertheless, EPA is aware of other situations
for which restrictions are warranted to minimize potential risks to the environment and health from exposure to PCB
Articles which are being stored for reuse. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
There are many compelling reasons for allowing the storage for reuse of PCB Articles. Since transformers, for example,
can easily have an active service life of more than 40 years, disposing of this equipment prematurely based upon an
arbitrary time limit would not be economically prudent nor serve any environmental goals. Placing such a piece of
electrical equipment in storage for reuse to be used as a spare or in emergency situations is both prudent and economically
sound. EPA is proposing to minimize the potential risks associated with the storage for reuse of this equipment, that
once it is placed in storage for reuse it be treated as if it were in use (i.e., in-service). 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Commenters provided a number of scenarios in which extended storage for reuse is warranted: (1) Some PCB Articles
are designed and manufactured for very specific use and size requirements and for which replacement is imperative
for the continued uninterrupted operation of a facility (i.e., power rectifiers to convert electrical power to a
usable form for specific manufacturing operations, side-mounted bushings, etc.); (2) certain industries must
maintain inventories of all vintages of spare equipment, for example, owners of locomotive and stationary PCB Transformers
often maintain these units in storage for reuse for a number of years prior to reinstalling and reusing the transformer;
(3) aircraft and airport operations require airport safety and facility operational flexibility and expedient
maintenance capabilities; (4) changes in facility ownership or business transactions may result in the premature
storage of some PCB Articles; (5) there may also be difficulties forecasting electrical demand or specialty needs
and obtaining parts for repair which are not readily available; and (6) if spares of older designs that had been removed
from service for reuse could not be maintained, significant changes to system design would be necessary and in-service
equipment would have to be replaced. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Although EPA takes these many factors and situations into consideration, there are nevertheless, situations where
the storage for reuse policy is abused. This abuse results, or has the potential to result, in serious environmental
damage. It is these situations which the Agency is seeking to control by limiting the time allowed for storage for reuse
and imposing other safeguards. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Certain types of businesses, by their nature (e.g., brokers, junk yards, service shops, etc.), accumulate larger
quantities or volumes of PCBs than owners or users (e.g., a utility or industrial facility). Besides accumulating
large volumes of PCB equipment that in many cases are in disrepair and may not be intact and non-leaking, these businesses
have no intent of reusing the equipment themselves. The equipment may be awaiting repair prior to some future resale
or may be in storage for ``reuse'' prior to purging for metal reclamation. In many cases, these units ``in storage for
reuse'' remain for years in locations that are exposed to the elements which further compromise the integrity of the
unit. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Therefore, EPA is proposing to add new 761.67 to limit storage for reuse in an area that was not designed, constructed
and operated in compliance with 761.65(b) for a maximum of 3 years from the date a PCB Article was taken out of service
or 3 years from the effective date of the final rule, whichever is later. PCB Articles placed into storage for reuse
would have to be labeled at the time the PCB Articles were taken out of service, or upon the effective date of the final
rule, and placed into storage for reuse. In addition, the storage for reuse of any PCB Article would have to comply with
all marking and recordkeeping regulations. Information required on these labels would include the date the equipment
was placed into storage for reuse, or the effective date of the final rule if the other date is not known, a projected
location for the future use of the equipment, and the date the equipment was scheduled for repair or servicing, if appropriate.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Individuals would be required, upon request of an EPA inspector, to provide records of the potential use for the stored
articles, a description of any leak containment precautions, and the PCB status (PCB or PCB-Contaminated) of the
PCB Article. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
PCB Articles that are intended to be stored for reuse for a period longer than 3 years would have to be disposed of unless
the person storing the PCB Article had requested and received from the Regional Administrator for the Region in which
the Article is located a written approval for an extension of the 3-year period. Anyone requesting an extension would
be required to do so in writing to the Regional Administrator no later than 6 months prior to the expiration of the storage
for reuse period. Requests for an extension of the storage period must include the rationale for exceeding the storage
limitation on an article-by-article basis. All extension requests would be subject to approval by the Regional Administrator
and any conditions the Regional Administrator deems necessary to protect health or the environment. A record of these
evaluations would have to be kept at the storage site for a minimum of 3 years. EPA also requests comment on the inclusion
of site-specific or nationwide exemption or waiver provisions in addition to the proposed waiver provision.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
One option for stored equipment would be to reclassify the equipment in storage for reuse. EPA, in another rulemaking,
is currently considering modifications to the reclassification regulations to facilitate a widespread application
of the reclassification procedures. Such an approach would significantly reduce the risk that might be posed by the
longterm storage for reuse of PCB or PCB-Contaminated equipment. PCB Equipment that is reclassified to non-PCB status
(i.e., 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=6 f=2 -->
&lt;
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
50 ppm) would not be subject to any of the storage for reuse restrictions proposed today. EPA recommends that owners
and users or brokers and servicers of PCB equipment develop their own ``reuse or reclassification schedule'' to account
for properly retained equipment. The schedule should include a simple inventory to aid in monitoring the status of
the equipment. This may include the reclassification schedule and/or the purpose for storing for reuse. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
One question raised in response to the ANPRM was whether the time between a piece of equipment's removal from service
for repair and its return to the owner is considered storage for reuse. Until a determination is made that the piece
of equipment can or cannot be repaired, any storage of that piece of electrical equipment prior to such a determination
is considered storage for reuse. The owner of malfunctioning equipment that has been sent off-site for repair will
still be subject to the 1-year time limit for storage and disposal, beginning on the date it was determined the equipment
could not be repaired. Although service facilities may hold units for several months while scheduling the unit for
repair, EPA views prolonged storage in such situations as an abuse of the storage provisions. Records must be maintained
by the servicers, for review by PCB inspectors, of the dates of receipt of the equipment for repair, the type of malfunction,
and the anticipated date for return of the equipment to the owner or user.

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
 Clarification of the 1-year time limit for storage and disposal.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 EPA proposes to clarify the requirement at 761.65(a) that states that a PCB Article or PCB Container must be disposed
of within 1 year from the date the item is first placed into storage. EPA is proposing to amend the language at 761.65(a)
to explicitly state EPA's original intent that the 1-year period begins on the date when the equipment is taken out
of service and designated for disposal (when it is determined by a servicer, for example, that the equipment cannot
be repaired) not when the equipment is placed into storage for disposal.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Currently, the 1-year time limit for storage and disposal of drums, which are used to collect liquid from various PCB
Articles, and for other containers used to store the accumulation of PCB wastes such as oil, rags, booties, cleanup
debris, etc., starts on the day an item is first placed into the container for storage for disposal. EPA is not proposing
to allow the accumulation in containers of these items for periods of greater than 1 year except as proposed in Unit
III.G.3 of this preamble. Currently this waste has to be stored in containers. However, comments suggested that this
is not a common practice and may lead to disagreements within the regulated community. Therefore, EPA is proposing
to change the language at 761.65(a) from ``PCB Article and PCB Containers'' to ``PCBs or PCB Items'' to effectively
capture all storage scenarios. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
For transformers that are taken out of service but are not drained until later, the 1-year clock, for both the oil and
the transformer, starts when the transformer is taken out of service and designated for disposal (i.e., the date of
removal from service for disposal). EPA also wants to clarify that the start date for the 1-year period for disposal
(and any other applicable requirements) for PCBs legally returned into the United States for disposal (see Unit II.D.3.h
and proposed 761.20(b)(3)) is the date the PCBs reach the port of entry in the continental United States, or the date
the PCBs reach the port of entry if the disposal facility is outside the continental United States or if the waste is
stored during transport for more than 10 days in a State. This policy applies to certain PCBs, to include wastes containing
PCBs at less than 50 ppm which are imported for disposal. The policy also applies to PCBs purchased in the United States.,
by the U.S. Government, taken overseas for use (including any wastes directly resulting from the remediation of these
PCBs), and subsequently returned to the United States for disposal in an approved facility from U.S. embassies, U.S.
military installations, other U.S. Government installations or territories, and PCBs imported under any Federal
administrative order issued under TSCA or any Federal court action.

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Situations which warrant an extension or waiver of the 1-year time limit for storage and disposal
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
. In the June 10, 1991 ANPRM, EPA solicited comments on whether an extension of the 1-year time limit for storage and
disposal requirement would be appropriate in situations, for example, innovative PCB destructive technologies;
such as biological treatment technologies that may take more than 1 year to achieve acceptable levels; and the absence
of disposal capacity, specifically for PCB/radioactive wastes. Comments on alternative options, procedures and/or
restrictions for dealing with such situations were also requested. EPA received several comments, most of which
supported the establishment of a provision which would allow the Regional Administrator for the Region in which the
material is stored, or the Director, CMD, if the Director issued the permit, to recognize situations which require
more than the 1-year time limit for storage and disposal, and to grant an extension to the requirement. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Commenters also identified other situations for which they believe equal consideration should be given to extending
the 1-year time limit for storage and disposal. These situations included: (1) Technologies, such as thermal separation
(thermal desorption) and bioremediation, that require more than 1 year to process waste at a remediation site; (2)
limited expedited remedial action undertaken ahead of the main remediation effort; and (3) conflicting remediation
or disposal requirements associated with the presence of certain co-regulated wastes from which the PCBs cannot
be separated (i.e., such as mine cable coated with a solid anti-fouling compound containing both PCBs and mercury).

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Most commenters supported the grounds for extension cited in the ANPRM (justification of need, demonstration that
treatment/disposal options are being pursued, and the submission of periodic progress reports). Other commenters
offered variations on the EPA proposal including: (1) Modify regulations to allow DOE to seek an extension on a complex-wide,
multifacility basis to address the PCB/radioactive waste situation and to submit reports on a biennial basis; (2)
for PCB/radioactive wastes, also require compliance with ALARA principles; (3) use a letter rather than the permit
process as the mechanism for granting extensions; (4) make the extension effective upon submission of the request,
or alternatively, make the extension automatic if the Agency does not object within 90 days; and (5) eliminate the
1-year limitation for extensions. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
EPA has considered these suggestions and is proposing several changes to 761.65(a). First, criteria for extending
the 1-year time limit for storage and disposal requirement include, but are not limited to: A demonstrated need to
store wastes beyond the 1-year time limit due to a lack of disposal capacity, the absence of a treatment technology,
or insufficient time to complete the treatment/destruction process and a demonstration that relevant treatment
or disposal requirements are being pursued. Additional criteria for PCB/radioactive waste, PCB/fissionable radioactive
wastes, or RCRA/mixed wastes and PCB/RCRA wastes could also be required to comply with the requirements of the appropriate
Federal, (i.e., Nuclear Regulatory Commission or EPA) or State regulatory authorities. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Anyone storing PCB waste that was subject to the 1-year time limit could provide written notification to the Regional
Administrator for the Region in which the PCB waste was stored that they had been unsuccessful in their continuing
attempts to dispose of their waste within the 1-year time limit and could receive an extension for one additional year
provided certain conditions were met. Second, the Regional Administrator could grant additional extensions of
1-year or longer upon receipt of a justified request. Third, EPA would consider including site-specific time frames
for storage and disposal, where appropriate, when approving a TSCA PCB storage or disposal application or a modification
to a previously issued approval (see 761.60(e) or 761.65(d)). 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
However, EPA is less receptive to allowing organizations to develop complex-wide (i.e., nationwide) justifications
and/or reports of their storage and disposal activities. If the data were allowed to be submitted in an aggregate form,
resources would be required to disaggregate the information and transmit the data to the appropriate Regional Administrator.
Nonetheless, EPA would consider aggregation of these data on a Regional basis for submission to and approval by the
Regional Administrator for the Region in which the materials are stored. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Finally, under the proposal EPA may impose conditions when approving requests for an extension. These conditions
would vary due to the specifics of each situation. Therefore, it is not possible to list every conceivable requirement
that could be imposed on a facility in granting additional or longer extensions. EPA is proposing that the Regional
Administrator or the Director, CMD, may require any information deemed necessary to ensure protection of health
and the environment, and may likewise require that additional steps be taken during the storage period, such as marking,
inspection, recordkeeping or financial assurance or complying with ALARA principles for PCB/radioactive wastes
to protect health or the environment. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
EPA wishes to make a distinction between those situations for which an extension of the storage and disposal requirement
may be legitimate (see example (3) above) versus those situations that would result in the abuse of such an extension,
such as the acceptance of PCB wastes in excess of the capacity limitations imposed either by the permit or the physical
constraints of the technology being used. EPA does not believe an extension of the storage and disposal requirement
is warranted because of failure to initiate attempts to obtain disposal capacity, the cost of disposal, or to allow
for the aggregation by multiple generators of PCB wastes into one vehicle for shipment. EPA is not modifying its view
that PCB wastes should be properly managed and disposed of as quickly as possible, and therefore is not inclined to
take steps that would relieve the generator of its responsibility to remove the PCBs from the environment in a timely
manner. On the other hand, individuals engaged in on-site remediation activities are most likely conducting those
activities in accordance with some instrument developed by EPA, another Federal agency, or a State that provides
instruction on what/how the project is to be conducted and when the project is to be completed (as the case may be for
examples (1) and (2) above). In these instances, the TSCA PCB permit and 1-year time limit for storage and disposal
may not apply. (Also see the discussion regarding the Coordinated Approval provision at Unit III.K. of this preamble.)

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
EPA would also consider extension requests to be legitimate when an individual's ability to store and dispose of PCBs
within the 1 year is inhibited by other Federal or State disposal/remedial requirements (e.g., RCRA, CERCLA, the
Clean Water Act (CWA), the Clean Air Act (CAA)), or any statute governing remedial actions which involve PCBs at or
derived from federally-regulated levels.

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
 Temporary storage of PCB liquid at 500 ppm or greater.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 Under the existing regulations at 761.65(c)(1), temporary storage is allowed for certain PCB Items, including PCB
Containers that are filled with liquid containing PCBs at concentrations of 50 to 499 ppm in an area that does not meet
the requirements of paragraph (b) of that section for up to 30 days from the date of their removal from use. In the case
of liquid PCBs, a Spill Prevention, Control, and Countermeasure (SPCC) Plan must be in place for the temporary storage
area in accordance with 40 CFR part 112. The current regulations, however, do not authorize temporary storage of liquids
containing PCBs with a concentration of 500 ppm or greater. However, the current regulations at 761.20(c)(2) authorize
the processing and distribution in commerce of PCBs and PCB Items greater than 50 ppm for purposes of disposal. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Agency does not believe that there are significant risks associated with temporarily storing for disposal PCB
liquids at concentrations greater than 500 ppm provided the waste is in containers meeting DOT specifications and
an SPCC plan is implemented. In the ANPRM, EPA suggested two approaches to amending the regulations to allow the temporary
storage of liquids greater than 500 ppm: (1) To add a provision to allow temporary storage of liquid with concentrations
of 500 ppm or greater at 761.65(c)(1), or (2) to consider the holding/storing of this liquid as a step in the disposal
process. Most commenters supported the option of amending the temporary storage provision at 761.65(c) as opposed
to amending the provision at 761.20(c) which allows the processing and distribution in commerce of PCBs and PCB Items
for disposal. Many commenters also suggested increasing the 30-day time allotted for temporary storage. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Agency believes it is appropriate to extend the allowance for temporary storage for disposal of liquid PCB waste
above 500 ppm, but not beyond the existing 30-day limit. The point of the 30-day temporary storage provision is to allow
for the accumulation of waste prior to shipment to a disposal facility or commercial storage facility. This rationale
should also apply to liquids above 500 ppm, especially when one considers the preponderance of PCB Transformer owners
who are opting for reclassification of these units. To have them build or ship to a formal storage area in each instance
would be unduly burdensome. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
EPA is proposing that the 30-day temporary provision at 761.65(c)(1) be extended to liquids at 500 ppm or greater,
provided an SPCC Plan is in place and the liquid waste is in stationary bulk storage tanks (excluding rolling stock
such as, but not limited to, tanker trucks) or DOT specification containers.

 Storage of large PCB Capacitors and PCB-Contaminated equipment on pallets next to a qualified storage area.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 The storage for disposal of non-leaking and structurally undamaged Large High Voltage capacitors and PCB-Contaminated
Transformers on pallets next to qualified storage areas was permitted until January 1, 1983, under the May 31, 1979,
PCB rule (formerly 40 CFR 761.42(c)(2)). This provision was designed to relieve the burden on PCB storage facilities
until EPA-approved incineration facilities were commercially available. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In light of the fact that EPA was initiating an accelerated phaseout of Large PCB Capacitors (Final Electrical Equipment
Use Rule, August 25, 1982, 47 FR 37342), EPA recognized that there would be a need for additional storage space for this
type of equipment. Therefore, temporary storage for disposal was allowed indefinitely after January 1, 1983, on
pallets next to a qualified storage facility for PCB-Contaminated Electrical Equipment and PCB Large High Voltage
Capacitors (761.65(c)(2)). 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In today's proposal, EPA is proposing to delete 761.65(c)(2) from the PCB regulations since the October 1, 1988 phaseout
date (761.30(l)(1)) for most uses of PCB Large High Voltage Capacitors has passed and there should no longer be a need
for additional storage space for this type of equipment. In addition, EPA does not believe that this provision is needed
for PCB-Contaminated Electrical Equipment because this equipment is typically drained prior to disposal and the
drained hull or carcass is not subject to the storage for disposal provisions of 761.65. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The current PCB regulations do not prohibit expansion of the storage capacity of a given storage area as long as, in
the case of commercial storage facilities, the closure plan, and financial assurance mechanisms are also adjusted
to reflect the increased amount of waste stored at the facility. EPA believes that the deletion of this provision for
storage on pallets next to a qualified storage area will not result in undue hardships on existing storage facilities.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
EPA is soliciting comments on the appropriateness of deleting this provision and also seeks information from storers
of PCB waste as to whether they are currently utilizing the provisions of 761.65(c)(2).

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
 Alternate storage of PCBs.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 EPA is proposing a modification at 761.65(b)(2) to the storage requirements to allow the storage of PCBs and PCB Items
designated for disposal in waste management units permitted by EPA under section 3004 of RCRA or by a State authorized
under section 3006 of RCRA to manage hazardous waste in containers. This proposal would also allow the storage in units
otherwise regulated by a State under a TSCA look-alike law or approved as part of a PCB disposal approval. EPA believes
that the RCRA requirements for permitted container storage units provide an equal level of protection to the TSCA
requirements, and preclude an unreasonable risk of injury from PCBs (i.e., recordkeeping, waste tracking, secondary
containment, monitoring for leaks, inspections, and financial assurance and closure requirements). This proposal
does not extend to units operating in interim status under RCRA. All other requirements for PCB wastes, including
but not limited to containerization, marking, recordkeeping, manifesting, and spill cleanup would continue to
apply. Any PCBs or PCB Items that are currently required to be stored in compliance with 40 CFR 761.65(b)(1) would be
eligible. PCBs, especially large volume wastes, which would otherwise be required to be stored in compliance with
this section could be stored instead under the terms and conditions of a PCB disposal approval. It may not be feasible
or desirable to construct a PCB storage area where large volumes of PCB remediation wastes or PCB Items are concerned.
EPA views storage and disposal of PCB wastes as a continuum and believes this issue of storage of large volume wastes
is best addressed on a case-by-case basis through the PCB approval or other permitting process. However, anyone subject
to the PCB storage requirements could choose to follow 761.65(b)(1) and not avail themselves of these other options.

 Storage requirements for PCB Article Containers.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 Under 761.65(c)(5), PCB Articles and PCB Containers are required to be checked periodically for leaks, and 761.65(c)(8)
requires that they be dated when they are placed into storage. By not including PCB Article Containers in 761.65(c)(5)
and (c)(8), a loophole exists that allows a storage unit owner to omit dating and inspecting these containers and to
circumvent the 1-year time limit for storage and disposal requirement. Therefore, EPA is proposing to correct this
oversight by replacing the phrase ``PCB Articles and PCB Containers'' with ``PCB Items'' wherever it occurs in 761.65(c)(5)
and (c)(8).

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
 Recordkeeping requirements for storage unit operators.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 Certain additional recordkeeping requirements for storage unit operators are being proposed under 761.180(a)(1)
and (b)(1). The first addition would be to require the operator to maintain a record of the inspections for leaks, and
cleanups, that must be performed under 761.65(c)(5). Currently, EPA inspectors have no way to verify that unit operators
are complying with these requirements. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In addition, EPA is proposing that storage unit operators keep an up-to-date written inventory or log of what they
are currently holding in their unit. The annual log requires similar information; but since it is an annual summary,
it does not reflect what is actually in a unit on a given day and thus is of no assistance to an EPA inspector performing
a site inspection. Although this would be an additional recordkeeping requirement, EPA believes that it would not
place any additional burden on unit operations. EPA believes that most operators maintain some sort of inventory;
maintenance of such is almost a necessity to properly manage a facility, as well as to ensure compliance with the 1-year
time limit for storage and disposal deadline, and to collect data for the annual log. Allowing EPA inspectors access
to this inventory would greatly facilitate on-site inspections, particularly at larger facilities. Also, since
the purpose of this inventory is to facilitate on-site inspections, EPA is requiring that the inventory be maintained
on-site at the storage unit, rather than at a central facility. This requirement to maintain the inventory on-site
applies only to this inventory, and affects no other portion on the annual records.

 Revision to storage unit criteria. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 Proposed 761.65(b)(1)(iv) would reflect the proposed definition of ``Porous surface'' found at 761.3. This proposed
definition includes concrete and cement within the definition of ``Porous surface.'' The reference to Portland
cement or concrete in 761.65(b)(1)(iv) as impervious would be inconsistent with the proposed definition of ``Porous
surface.'' The references to Portland cement and concrete would not be deleted, however, from 761.65(b)(1)(iv)
because this would create a situation where all existing storage units that have used Portland cement or concrete
would be out of compliance. Therefore, the references have remained, albeit parenthetically, to Portland cement
or concrete as acceptable. EPA would recommend, however, that nonporous surfaces be used for curbing and flooring
for storage units since cleanup of nonporous surfaces is easier and less costly.

EPA has incorporated by reference several test standards developed by the American Society for Testing and Materials
(ASTM) which describe various testing and sampling procedures for conducting PCB analyses. These standards are
referenced throughout 40 CFR part 761, and a listing of the applicable test methods can be found in the back of the CFR
under the heading ``Material Approved for Incorporation by Reference;'' 40 CFR chapter I (parts 761, 763)_Subchapter
R_Toxic Substances Control Act, Environmental Protection Agency. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
EPA published a final rule on April 16, 1992, which updated the listing of the ASTM test standards incorporated by reference
in the PCB regulations. In that rule, EPA indicated that copies of ASTM standards were available for inspection and
copying at the TSCA Public Reading Room. This notation is also included at 761.19 which states: ``Copies of the incorporated
material may be obtained from the TSCA Public Docket Office (7407) Rm. B&hyph;607, Northeast Mall, Office of Pollution
Prevention and Toxics, Environmental Protection Agency, 401 M St., SW., Washington, DC 20460, or from the American
Society for Testing and Materials (ASTM), 1916 Race Street, Philadelphia, PA 19103.'' On May 21, 1992, ASTM contacted
EPA and requested that the Agency either produce a copy of an existing agreement that grants EPA permission to reproduce
ASTM standards (i.e., copyrighted material) or refrain from making further copies until permission is granted.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
While EPA does not believe that copyright law prohibits the copying of copyrighted materials that are part of a statute
or regulation, EPA has offered to refer requests for copies of the ASTM standards to ASTM. EPA's offer, however, makes
clear that EPA will continue to satisfy requests for these documents under the Freedom of Information Act. Therefore,
in today's notice, EPA is proposing to modify the regulatory text at 761.19. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
EPA also received one comment reminding the Agency of an earlier commitment to propose the addition of ASTM Method
D&hyph;4059, ``Standard Method for Analysis of Polychlorinated Biphenyls in Insulating Liquids by Gas Chromatography,''
which ASTM has validated through a series of round robin tests, to the list of references. Copies of the test method,
ASTM D&hyph;4059, are available for public inspection at the TSCA Nonconfidential Information Center (7407), Office
of Pollution Prevention and Toxics, Rm. B&hyph;607, Northeast Mall, at the address listed earlier in this notice.
Copies of the standard are available from the ASTM, 1916 Race Street, Philadelphia, PA 19103. Instead of incorporating
this standard, EPA proposes adding 761.60(g)(1)(iii) and (2)(iii) to identify ASTM D&hyph;4059 and other applicable
EPA procedures as standards that can be used for the analysis of PCBs when using gas chromatography. Comments are invited
on whether the PCB regulations at 40 CFR part 761 should be amended to include this procedure.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
EPA received comments that the current regulatory requirement to obtain a rearch and development (R&amp;D) approval
(761.60(e) and (i) and 761.70(a) and (b)) limits innovative development of effective remediation technologies
such as identifying biological and other innovative processes that destroy or contain PCBs, developing technologies
that can enhance those processes, finding methods of separating PCB contaminants from other media, and identifying
contaminants present in environmental samples so that appropriate remediation techniques may be selected and applied.
A comment was submitted for EPA's consideration citing as rationale for a change the regulation's inflexible and
harmful effects on international scientific exchange and U.S. competitive/technological advancement. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The commenter included a suggestion that EPA eliminate the requirement to obtain a R&amp;D approval for research
into the disposal of PCBs, allow the manufacture of 13.23 lbs. of PCBs per facility annually, and eliminate restrictions
placed on the import/export of PCBs. The comment would require notification of the Regional Administrator of the
facility's site, the amount of PCBs to be handled, whether R&amp;D activities were laboratory scale or not, and whether
PCBs would be manufactured. Additionally, the principal researcher would be required to certify that the R&amp;D
facility would be in compliance with the terms of the PCB regulations. Other features of the comment included storage
of materials pursuant to the requirements at 761.65(b) and (c), labelling the work areas with the ML mark, maintenance
of a log covering materials received and shipped (e.g., date, source, PCB weight, media), compliance with OSHA laboratory
and recognized research practices, disposal of materials within 1 year of completion of the R&amp;D activity, and
a provision that the Regional Administrator could terminate the R&amp;D activities if a determination could be made
that the PCB regulations had been violated or that bona fide R&amp;D activities were not being conducted at the facility.
Finally, the material would be shipped in compliance with DOT regulations, or if applicable, the laws of a foreign
nation. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The potential quantity of PCBs the comment would allow each R&amp;D facility to manufacture (i.e., 0.5 kilograms
within 30 days, or roughly 13.23 pounds per year per facility) is of particular concern to the Agency. EPA recognizes
the public policy importance of PCB research; however, there is a need to maintain a certain level of control over the
manufacture of PCBs for R&amp;D activities. Further, as more countries ratify international agreements to control
the movement of PCBs across their borders, it would be inappropriate for the United States to establish a rule or policy
that would allow the indiscriminate transboundary movement of PCBs. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
EPA has considered the commenter's proposal and in 761.80(e) is proposing to grant a class exemption to all R&amp;D
facilities to manufacture (including import) PCBs solely for the facility's own research for the development of
PCB disposal technologies, but not for purposes of distributing in commerce the PCBs that are manufactured. For purposes
of this rulemaking provision, use ``solely in a facility's own research'' would mean use by the manufacturer or one
of its wholly owned subsidiaries conducting disposal-related research and development. All PCBs and materials
containing PCBs, regardless of concentration, resulting from the conduct of disposal-related studies, would be
required to be decontaminated or disposed of pursuant to the original PCB concentration. EPA proposes to limit PCB
manufacturing, including import, activities to no more than 454 grams (or 1 pound) of PCBs per year. Since PCBs are
generally used in extremely small quantities (i.e., micrograms) during R&amp;D activities, EPA believes, based
on its experience in issuing R&amp;D approvals, that an annual limitation on the manufacture of PCBs at no more than
1 pound for each R&amp;D facility should be adequate. Individuals wishing to exceed this amount would be required
to submit a petition pursuant to TSCA section 6(e)(3)(B) and the interim procedural rules at 40 CFR part 750. Likewise,
EPA is proposing to grant a class exemption at 761.80(g) to allows the processing and distribution in commerce of PCBs
for the purpose of exporting PCBs for research and development.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
To be included in the class exemption, a petition for an exemption from the manufacturing prohibitions would have
to be received by EPA within 60 days of the effective date of the final rule or 60 days prior to engaging in this activity.
Renewals of or modifications to the petition would be required annually pursuant to the interim procedures for manufacturing
exemptions at 750.11(e)(1), as finalized in the 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 -->
Federal Register
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 of April 11, 1994 (59 FR 16991). In order to reduce the paperwork burden of the renewal process for the class, EPA would
deem a properly filed request for a renewal of the exemption by any member of the class as a renewal request for the entire
class. In addition, to ensure the manufacture of PCBs is being conducted for purposes of research and development
into the disposal of PCBs, EPA is proposing that the Regional Administrator be notified in writing 30 days prior to
the commencement of R&amp;D activities that require the manufacture of PCBs. However, this notification would not
be required if an individual has obtained a PCB R&amp;D approval from EPA pursuant to 761.60(a), (i)(2), and 761.70(a)
or 761.70(b) and the approval contains a provision regarding the manufacture of PCBs. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In granting an exemption under section 6(e)(3)(B) of TSCA, a demonstration must be made that there is no unreasonable
risk of injury to health or the environment associated with the exempted activity and that good faith efforts have
been conducted to find a substitute for PCBs. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
OSHA regulates workplace safety in laboratories under 29 CFR 1910.1450. These regulations define ``laboratory''
as ``a facility where the 'laboratory use of hazardous chemicals' occurs. It is a workplace where relatively small
quantities of hazardous chemicals are used on a non-production basis.'' ``Laboratory scale'' means ``work with
substances in which the containers used for reactions, transfers, and other handling of substances are designed
to be easily and safely manipulated by one person.'' ``Laboratory scale'' excludes those workplaces whose function
is to provide commercial quantities of materials. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Under 29 CFR 1910.1450, an employer, among other requirements, must develop and carry out the provisions of a written
Chemical Hygiene Plan for employees working in laboratories. Appendix A of that section is non-mandatory, but provides
guidance to assist employers. The guidance in Appendix A was extracted from ``Prudent Practices for Handling Hazardous
Chemicals in Laboratories,'' which is available from the National Academy Press, 2101 Constitution Avenue, NW.,
Washington, DC 20418. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
``Prudent Practices'' is cited in the OSHA regulations because of its wide distribution and acceptance and because
of its preparation by members of the laboratory community through the sponsorship of the National Research Council.
``Prudent Practices'' deals with both safety and chemical hazards, while the OSHA laboratory standard is concerned
primarily with chemical hazards. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
EPA believes that the limited manufacture (i.e., 1 pound or less of PCBs) and use of PCBs in conducting research pursuant
to the OSHA workplace safety requirements would not result in an environmental release of PCBs or risks of exposure
to PCBs due to the highly trained nature of laboratory workers and scientists, the limitation on the volume of production,
and the current marking regulations that require containers be labelled as containing PCBs. Instrumentation contaminated
with PCBs would be required to be decontaminated in accordance with current requirements at 761.79, using a triple
rinse procedure in which each rinse is 10 percent or greater of the volume of the container, or disposed of pursuant
to the regulations at 40 CFR 761.60. Finally, all wastes, including diluted PCB materials and any PCB residues or other
contaminated media, would be subject to the 1&hyph;year time limit for storage and disposal requirements at 761.65
and 761.60 and the manifesting requirements at 761.207 et seq. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The good faith efforts finding does not apply because other chemicals cannot be substituted in toxicological, environmental
or analytical testing for PCBs. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Agency solicits comments on its proposal to establish a class exemption that authorizes the limited manufacture,
or import, of PCBs for use in one's own research for the purpose of conducting disposal-related studies.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
EPA has received a number of inquiries as to whether ``round robin'' analytical exercises or inter-laboratory studies
require exemptions from the ban on the distribution of PCBs. EPA's response has been that these exercises may be exempt
if they meet the requirements of the current provision at 761.80(g). These kinds of activities are normally conducted
as quality assurance measures to test or verify a laboratory's performance using a given chemical analysis methodology.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In authorizing the processing and distribution in commerce of small quantities of PCBs for research and development
in 1984, EPA was addressing the need to process and distribute in commerce PCBs for activities such as toxicological
and environmental testing and analytical testing that include analyzing and monitoring PCBs in the air, soil, surface
waters, and sediments; conducting bioassays and toxicological studies; and producing reference standards for
identifying PCBs using gas chromatography (49 FR 28162, July 10, 1984). ``Small quantities for research and development''
is currently defined at 761.3 as ``any quantity of PCBs (1) that is originally packaged in one or more hermetically
sealed containers of a volume of no more than five (5.0) milliliters, and (2) that is used only for purposes of scientific
experimentation or analysis, or chemical research on, or analysis of, PCBs, but not for research or analysis for the
development of a PCB product.'' 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
EPA intends to retain the class exemption at 761.80(g) so that these activities may be continued without disruption.
So as not to change the scope of the class exemption at 761.80(g), EPA proposes to modify 761.80(g) by adding to it the
criteria currently found at 761.3 in the definition of small quantities for research and development. Further, EPA
is proposing, for purposes of consistency, to modify the provision at 761.80(o) that addresses the renewal requirements
for the class exemption at 761.80(g). Under current section 761.80(g)(2), any person or company covered by the class
exemption who expects to exceed the limitation on the amount of PCBs that may be processed or distributed in commerce
in 1 year (100 grams or 0.22 pound) must report to (i.e., petition) EPA, identifying the sites of PCB activities and
the quantity of PCBs to be processed or distributed in commerce pursuant to 761.80(g)(2). EPA is proposing to modify
761.80(o) to clarify that activities being conducted under the class exemption may be continued only when the activities
conform to the provision at 761.80(g). To increase the quantities of PCBs that are processed or distributed at 761.80(g)(2),
individuals must submit a written request to the Director, CMD for approval to exceed the 100 grams limit prior to engaging
in the activity. Each request must include a justification for the increase. Any increase granted will be in writing
and will extend only for the time remaining in a specific exemption year. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
EPA also recognizes that some laboratories may work with amounts of media containing PCBs that are needed for chemical
analysis procedures at required quantitation levels and which will not fit into 5.0 milliliter hermetically sealed
vials. For example, many non-academic research scenarios require the use of contaminated media to conduct chemical
analyses; to conduct health and environmental studies; and as quality assurance samples for evaluating innovative
disposal technologies. Increasing efforts are being devoted to remediating PCB contamination, whether under TSCA
or some other environmental statute. As a result, the use of media containing PCBs as quality assurance environmental
samples plays a much larger role in the disposal universe than it did initially. Today, environmental samples containing
PCBs are required and are used in conducting research activities to determine toxicity, health, environmental,
and other effects. The Agency's intent in proposing to broaden the use authorization at 761.30(j) and to add a class
exemption for processors and distributors of media containing PCBs at 761.80(i) is to promote required testing for
toxicity and health effects which may be used in setting risk-based cleanup levels at PCB remediation sites. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
1. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Use authorization. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 Under the current 761.30(j), PCBs may be used in small quantities for research and development. That term is narrowly
defined at 761.3. PCB uses not compatible with the limitations established by that definition can only be authorized
through rulemaking or a disposal approval under 761.60(e), 761.60(i)(2), or 761.70(a) and (b), if the PCBs are to
be used in conjunction with developing disposal technologies. This proposal would delete the definition of ``small
quantities for research and development'' and would modify 761.30(j) to allow the use for research and development
of PCBs in organic liquids and contaminated media other than organic liquids which did not exceed the proposed material
limitations. This change would eliminate the time-consuming process of obtaining an approval or awaiting regulatory
changes for the use of PCBs when conducting tests to determine toxicity, health, environmental, and other effects.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Under proposed 761.30(j), permissible research and development activities would include, but not be limited to,
scientific experimentation or chemical research on PCBs, and the chemical analysis of PCBs and testing to determine:
biochemical transport processes; environmental transport processes; the effects of PCBs on aquatic and terrestrial
environments; and the health effects of PCBs such as general toxicity, subchronic toxicity, chronic toxicity, specific
organ/tissue toxicity, neurotoxicity, genetic toxicity, and metabolic products. However, permissible research
and development activities would not include research or analysis for the development of a PCB product. This section
would allow the continued use of PCBs in limited quantities for research and development provided the PCBs were originally
packaged in hermetically sealed containers no larger than 5 milliliters, or as samples of environmental media containing
PCBs in containers larger than 5 milliliters that had been packaged pursuant to the DOT performance standards at 49
CFR parts 171&hyph;180 when the following requirements were met: 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(a) The Regional Administrator was notified in writing 30 days prior to the commencement of any R&amp;D activity authorized
under this section. Notifications would have to include information which identifies the sites of PCB R&amp;D activities,
the quantity of PCBs to be used, the type of R&amp;D process to be used, the kind of material being treated, and includes
an estimate of the duration of the PCB activity. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(b) No more than 100 grams of pure PCBs could be used annually at a facility. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(c) All PCB wastes (e.g., spent laboratory samples, residuals, unused samples, contaminated media/instrumentation,
clothing, etc.) would have to be stored in a unit that complies with the storage requirements of 761.65(b). 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(d) Manifests were used for all R&amp;D PCB wastes being transported from the R&amp;D facility to a storage and/or
disposal facility. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(e) Requests would have to be submitted in writing to the Regional Administrator for approval to exceed the 100 grams
in total weight of pure PCB limitation for use in non-disposal PCB research and development activities. Such requests
would have to provide a justification for the additional quantity needed, as well as specify the quantity of PCBs that
would be needed. The approval would be in writing, signed by the Regional Administrator, and include all requirements
that would be applicable to the R&amp;D activity. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
All R&amp;D facilities would have to comply with the applicable storage and disposal requirements of subpart D, and
applicable Federal, State, and local laws and regulations. The requirements at 761.207 to manifest PCB waste at concentrations
of 50 ppm or greater would not apply to PCB samples taken from any PCB waste and sent off-site to be used for research and
development under proposed 761.30(j). In addition, all PCB wastes would be subject to the 1&hyph;year time limit
for storage and disposal requirements at 761.65. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
This proposal would create a distinction between PCB wastes that a generator decides to place into storage or send
to a disposal facility for final disposal, to which manifesting requirements would still apply, and PCB samples that
remain in use for quantitative analysis of constituents in the samples and PCBs which are sent for treatability or
other limited research and development for PCB disposal activities, such as, materials containing 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=6 f=2 -->
;
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
50 ppm PCBs as a result of a spill. Samples of materials containing PCBs and meeting the requirements of the proposed
revised use authorization would be considered ``PCB materials in use'' and not PCB wastes. Manifests would not be
required to return unused samples under 761.30(j), or untreated samples under 761.60(j), to the site of generation,
such as a Superfund remediation site, or under the provisions of proposed 761.77, Coordinated Approval. (See Unit
III.K. of this preamble for a discussion of the Coordinated Approval.) However, spent laboratory or R&amp;D samples
could not be placed back in use after completion of the study. Materials not returned to the site of generation would
then be considered wastes and would be required to be disposed of pursuant to the provisions at 761.60. Individuals
handling waste that had been subsequently placed into storage for disposal or shipped to a disposal facility would
again be subject to the notification and manifesting requirements of subpart K. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
EPA also received a proposal regarding research and development activities in which the commenter questioned why
regulatory approval is required for PCB R&amp;D activities when no such impediment is imposed on facilities that
are engaged in research involving neurotoxins, bioactive micro-organisms, and highly radioactive substances.
Proposed changes in 761.30(j) would make it clear that EPA has interpreted that research on the physical properties,
chemical properties, chemical analysis, toxicity, health effects, and environmental effects of PCBs falls under
the use authorization in that paragraph. Treatability research on the disposal of any kind of PCB waste, using any
kind of disposal technology, including the use of microorganisms to degrade, destroy, or chemically alter PCBs,
falls under disposal and not use, and is being addressed in the new proposed 761.60(j). Facilities that conduct treatability
research or R&amp;D into PCB disposal would have to comply with applicable notification requirements of subpart
K, the storage and disposal requirements of subpart D, and applicable Federal, State, and local laws and regulations.
To comply with the notification requirements of 761.205, the facility would have to notify EPA using EPA Form 7710&hyph;53,
``Notification of PCB Activity''. (For the reader's convenience, a copy of the draft revised form is inserted in this
part of the preamble; when the rule becomes effective, the final version may be used to notify EPA of PCB waste handling
activities. The form will not appear in the codified text.)

Although processors/distributors would have the option of expanding their processing/distributing activities,
they would also incur the responsibility of providing, in the form of a petition, notification to EPA if they chose

In the ANPRM, EPA solicited comments on whether it should codify its policy that exempts EPA laboratories and other
U.S. Government agency laboratories, i.e., the National Institute for Standards and Testing (NIST), from the processing
and distribution in commerce prohibitions when such activity is being conducted to effectively implement or enforce
the regulations. Since an accurate determination of PCB concentration is the basis for compliance with many of the
PCB regulations, such activities are crucial for effective compliance by the regulated community and effective
enforcement by EPA. Therefore, the class exemption at 761.80(i) is intended to also address the need for EPA and other
Federal Government laboratories to process and distribute in commerce small quantities of PCBs for purposes of supporting
enforcement or compliance activities. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
EPA is proposing at 761.80(p) that a properly filed request for a renewal of the exemption by any member of the class
would be deemed a renewal request for the entire class. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Individual processors/distributors wishing to exceed the limit of 100 grams by total weight of pure PCBs proposed
at 761.80(i) would have to obtain approval from the Director, Chemical Management Division who may grant approval,
without further rulemaking, to any processor or distributor who qualifies for the exemption. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The standards imposed by TSCA section 6(e)(3)(B) for granting an exemption based on no unreasonable risk and good
faith efforts to develop substitute substances must be addressed. EPA believes that no unreasonable risk would result
from the processing and distribution in commerce of media containing PCBs because such samples would be handled by
laboratories that have established procedures for handling hazardous materials. (See Unit III.I. of this preamble
for a discussion of the OSHA laboratory workplace safety requirements.) Further, EPA believes that the use of such
samples would further enhance efforts to implement, comply with, and enforce the requirements for PCBs under TSCA.
Once the use of such samples was over, persons who had used the samples would be subject to any Federal, State, and local
law governing the disposal of the PCBs, including the rules found in 40 CFR part 761. The good faith efforts finding
does not apply because other chemicals cannot be substituted for PCBs for these purposes.

In the ANPRM, EPA solicited comments on a proposal to recognize other Federal and/or State-issued PCB storage and
disposal permits with the view toward limiting concurrent Federal/State and multi-Federal permitting of PCB storage
and/or disposal facilities. (Implementation of Federal requirements promulgated under section 6 of TSCA regulating
the manufacture, processing, distribution in commerce, and use of PCBs would not be affected by this proposal.) Under
this proposal, dual or multiple permitting requirements could be eliminated where the TSCA PCB Program would recognize
PCB remediation and disposal activities that were implemented and monitored under another authority. The goal is
to encourage recognition of other regulatory authorities and participation by additional States to implement some
form of a PCB disposal program under, for example, an expanded State RCRA hazardous waste program. In that way, limited
EPA resources could be diverted to other issues or areas where no other Federal or State PCB presence now exists. EPA
was interested in obtaining information on the perceived impacts of recognizing PCB disposal programs that are implemented
under either an expanded State waste management program (i.e., by listing PCBs as a hazardous waste) or a TSCA look-alike
program (i.e., by establishing a State PCB disposal program that is analogous to the TSCA PCB Program through the development
of State legislation and implementing regulations). Comments were solicited on enforcement activities and other
factors associated with implementing such a proposal (e.g., issues of national consistency, policy advantages
and/or disadvantages, etc.). Many comments submitted in response to the ANPRM reflect a misunderstanding of the
State enhancement proposal. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Roughly 30 comments were received on this issue with nearly 50 percent of the commenters in favor of the concept. Those
in favor of the proposal supported any reduction in duplicative permitting requirements that would lower the cost
of compliance, but viewed TSCA look-alike programs as the preferred approach. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Those opposed to the proposal voiced strongly held views that differences between Federal requirements, coupled
with inconsistency among State-imposed requirements, would severely hamper and complicate compliance efforts,
create confusion, result in increased costs to the regulated community, and possibly serve as a barrier to interstate
commerce. Additionally, differences between the TSCA and RCRA requirements were cited as having the opposite effect
of alleviating the burden for the regulated community in complying with the PCB disposal requirements. Examples
cited of scenarios where each of these disadvantages would be evident include utilities operating across State lines
or entities with interstate activities (e.g., natural gas transmission companies) and facilities with multiState
locations. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Several commenters questioned EPA's authority to establish a State-delegated PCB disposal program. These commenters
believe that TSCA's legislative history mandated implementation of the PCB disposal program at the national level,
and that anything short of a nationally orchestrated program would be
<!-- PJG 0101 clearpage -->
 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
abdicating EPA's responsibility. EPA disagrees with the legal interpretation and believes that this argument is
not compelling as a policy matter since PCB disposal facilities are currently subject to both Federal and State regulations
governing PCB disposal. Furthermore, recognition of the actions of another authority is not an abdication since
EPA retains authority to enforce the TSCA PCB regulations. Additionally, one commenter advocated transferring
the PCB Disposal Program to the RCRA program, or totally suspending the TSCA disposal requirements if a State chooses
to regulate PCBs under their expanded hazardous waste management program. The State enhancement proposal is not
intended to serve as a mechanism for ``delegating'' EPA's responsibility for implementing any of the statutory requirements
of TSCA. Federal oversight of PCB storage and disposal activities under State permits would still be undertaken.
One commenter suggested that all facilities should be required to register the use of PCB Transformers with EPA. If
the intent of such a registration program is to enhance monitoring capabilities over the disposal of this equipment,
EPA believes that it would be permissible under TSCA for a State to promulgate its own requirements for that purpose.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
TSCA section 18 addresses preemption of State law. Section 18 provides, with a few exceptions, that the provisions
of TSCA shall not affect the authority of any State or political subdivision of a State to establish or continue in effect
regulation of any chemical substance, mixture, or article containing such chemical substance or mixture. Under
section 18(a)(2), however, a State or locality is preempted from regulating a chemical substance or mixture to protect
against a risk of injury to health or the environment where EPA has acted under section 6 of TSCA to protect against such
risk. An exception to this preemption provision applies when the State regulation concerns a requirement ``described
in'' TSCA section 6(a)(6), i.e., the manner or method of disposal of a chemical substance or mixture. This provision,
referred to as the ``parenthetical exception'' to preemption, is enclosed in parentheses at the beginning of section
18, subsection (2)(B). EPA has interpreted the ``parenthetical exception'' to mean that State PCB disposal rules
are not preempted because they describe the manner or method of disposal of PCBs. Other examples of situations that
would not be preempted by TSCA include: (1) A State regulation that is identical to EPA's regulation; (2) a State requirement
that is ``adopted under the authority'' of another Federal law; (3) a State prohibition on the use of the substance
or mixture in the State (other than in its use in the manufacture or processing of other chemical substances or mixtures);
or (4) when a State or local government prevails in a petition to the Administrator for a rule that would exempt them
from the preemption requirement on the grounds that the State requirement is consistent with Federal requirements,
providing ``a significantly higher degree of protection'' while not unduly burdening interstate commerce.

 Coordinated approval.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 In the ANPRM, EPA requested comments on whether to adopt regulatory changes to reduce the need for concurrent permitting
for PCB storage and disposal by allowing recognition under TSCA of PCB storage and disposal permits issued under expanded
State hazardous waste or TSCA lookalike programs, or under other Federal environmental statutes (e.g., CERCLA site
remediation, RCRA corrective action, and National Pollution Discharge Elimination System permitting). The regulated
community often must procure both Federal and State permits prior to commencing PCB storage or disposal activities.
Current Federal requirements for PCB storage and disposal under TSCA, including the permitting requirements, are
set out at 40 CFR 761.60, 761.65, 761.70, and 761.75. Additional requirements are proposed in this notice at 761.61.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
EPA received several comments; those commenters maintained opposite views on this proposal. Comments addressing
the TSCA PCB Coordinated Approval mechanism suggested that such a ``program would trigger undesirable regulatory
responses under various environmental statutes for activities that fall under the jurisdiction of only one particular
statute.'' Although section 6(e)(1)(A) of TSCA requires the Administrator to prescribe methods for the disposal
of PCBs, section 9(b) of TSCA further requires the Administrator to coordinate actions taken under the Act with actions
taken under other Federal laws administered in whole or in part by the Administrator. Section 9(b) further requires
the Administrator to use such authorities to protect against such risk, if a determination can be made that the risk
to health or the environment can be eliminated or reduced to a sufficient extent by actions taken under other Federal
laws. Therefore, EPA believes the TSCA PCB Coordinated Approval provision is a viable alternative to issuing duplicative
TSCA PCB storage and disposal approvals. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
As with EPA's May 19, 1980, final rule under RCRA (45 FR 33325), EPA sees little value in requiring duplicative permit
proceedings and duplicate paperwork. A State that opts to expand its State hazardous waste program by including PCBs
would be operating under an expanded State authority, not under a federally-authorized or delegated program. In
that event, the State may elect to regulate all or some aspect of the disposal program. Standards developed by EPA under
programs such as the RCRA Land Disposal Restriction Requirements, RCRA Corrective Action permits, remediation
projects initiated under CERCLA, and/or expanded State hazardous waste programs which must incorporate Federal
standards as their baseline regulatory requirements are likely to provide a level of protection adequate for eliminating
or reducing to a sufficient extent the risks to health or the environment from exposure to PCBs and to require little
or no further review under TSCA. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Remediation of PCB contamination, based on site-specific conditions, may trigger compliance with several Federal
requirements such as TSCA, RCRA, CERCLA, and the National Pollution Discharge Elimination System (NPDES permitting),
just to name a few. Additionally, State environmental requirements, such as the California listed or New Jersey ``X-Code''
waste requirements, also may need to be factored into the regulatory requirements equation. For illustrative purposes,
an example of a current permitting scenario which resulted in multiple layers of various State/Federal involvement
and the benefits that would be derived under this proposal are presented here: 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
A manufacturing facility which discharged waste waters into a river located adjacent to the facility discovered
PCB contamination in the soils and the groundwater of a nearby residential community. Wells were drilled and PCB-laden
oil was found. Prior to the installation of oil/water separators in 1965, untreated process and stormwater flowed
into a brook (which flows through the property) and the river. This facility housed, among other things, a Transformer
Division, and from 1932 to 1977 insulating oil containing PCBs was used extensively in the operation of its transformer
plant. In addition, hazardous wastes, including wastes containing PCBs, were generated as a result of these and other
manufacturing processes. The wastes were disposed of both on- and off-site. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
PCB contamination in the river had been an issue since the late 1970s when studies conducted by EPA and the two neighboring
States detected PCBs in the sediments, fish, and waters of the river. The facility had obtained a NPDES permit from
EPA for discharges into a navigable waterway (in early 1978) and Interim Status under RCRA in 1980. In 1981, the facility
was required by EPA and the resident State Department of Environmental Protection (DEP) to conduct three major studies
focussing on: (1) The hazardous waste disposal practices at the facility, (2) a determination of the extent of on-site
contamination, and (3) an assessment of the PCB contamination and corrective action alternatives for the nearby
river. The studies concluded that sediment along the river was contaminated with 39,000 pounds of PCBs. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Using the authority of the State's Superfund Law, the facility was required in 1981 to install groundwater pumps and
remove PCB containing oil from the top of the groundwater. In 1987, the facility installed a slurry wall to minimize
migration of the PCBs towards the river. In 1988, EPA's Regional office issued a TSCA disposal permit for a high temperature,
thermal oxidizer incinerator for the destruction of the oil containing PCBs. Also in 1988, the facility was required
by the State DEP to make necessary repairs at the dam to decrease future transport of PCBs downstream. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Finally, in October 1988, EPA initiated the corrective action process under the provisions of the Hazardous and Solid
Waste Amendments (HSWA) of 1984 to RCRA. A draft RCRA Part B permit to initiate cleanup was developed by EPA in early
1989, and the final RCRA Corrective Action Permit was issued in early 1991. In addition, EPA's TSCA PCB disposal permitting
program had issued several R&amp;D permits to conduct pilot-scale experiments of the effectiveness of various bioremediation
processes as viable cleanup technologies. In summary, the facility was required to obtain operating and air emission
permits from the State DEP, corrective action permits from EPA under RCRA, a TSCA operating permit for the thermal
incinerator (issued by the Region), TSCA R&amp;D permits for pilot-scale experiments (issued by EPA Headquarters),
and a NPDES permit for water discharges. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
If the TSCA PCB Coordinated Approval proposal were a reality, the TSCA PCB Program could have recognized, in this case,
permits that could have been issued by the State for the operation of the thermal incinerator and the R&amp;D permits
for experimental disposal technologies if the State elected to either implement an expanded PCB program under its
RCRA authority or to establish a TSCA look-alike PCB disposal program. In addition, action taken under any Federal
authority (e.g., RCRA or CERCLA) to require remediation of PCB contamination could also be recognized as not posing
an unreasonable risk of injury and thus suitable for a TSCA PCB Coordinated Approval. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
One commenter, although supporting the concept of regulating PCB disposal activities under an expanded State hazardous
waste program for stationary technologies, encouraged EPA to maintain centralized control over PCB mobile technologies.
However, such an approach is not acceptable to EPA since there are limited situations whereby the Administrator can
preempt the State's authority to regulate PCB disposal activities. Although the TSCA PCB Coordinated Approval provision
would not require the owner or operator of a mobile, or multiple, but identical stationary unit to obtain a single approval
from EPA, it also would not require the owner or operator of such a unit to obtain multiple approvals from each State
in which the disposal technology will be used. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The owner or operator of a mobile, or multiple, but identical stationary unit may want to obtain a TSCA Coordinated
Approval to ensure the Federal and State requirements are harmonized. A State may chose to permit mobile technologies
that will be used exclusively in that State, and EPA would respect its authority to do so. However, an approval that
has been obtained from one state may not be acceptable to EPA in developing a TSCA Coordinated Approval that is intended
for use in multiple States. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Although the process for implementing a TSCA PCB Coordinated Approval mechanism was not discussed in the ANPRM, EPA
considered establishing a self-implementing or an interactive coordinated approval process. The two approaches
are discussed below. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
a.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
 Interactive approach.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 EPA proposes at 761.77 to recognize permits issued under other Federal laws administered by EPA and State PCB disposal
authorities using an interactive TSCA PCB Coordinated Approval mechanism. EPA believes the interactive approach
described below would provide the Agency the best opportunity to effectively oversee PCB activities that are conducted
under another statutory authority. In addition, the interactive coordinated approval would maximize the Regional
Administrator's ability to serve in a preventative rather than a reactive role in those instances where unintentional
negligence by the regulated community could result in risks of injury to health and the environment from exposure
to PCBs. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
At 761.77, EPA is proposing to include as a condition of the TSCA PCB Coordinated Approval all requirements, conditions,
and limitations of a non-TSCA permit or other waste management document issued by a State or under another statute
administered by EPA prior to the effective date of this rule. The provision allows for both simultaneous coordination
under the TSCA PCB permitting authority and the other State or Federal permitting authority when a waste management
document does not exist and the subsequent review and approval (or inclusion of additional conditions, if deemed
appropriate) of an existing waste management document. The facility could commence PCB waste storage or disposal
operations only after the Regional Administrator received and reviewed a request for a TSCA PCB Coordinated Approval
that included a copy of the non-TSCA approval and a verification that the facility had submitted EPA Form 7710&hyph;53
and received an EPA I.D. Number, which most facilities would already have for their hazardous waste management permit.
The Regional Administrator would either issue the TSCA PCB Coordinated Approval accepting the non-TSCA approval
as written provided the relevant standards of 761.77(b) through (g) have been met, request additional information,
impose additional conditions, or require the owner or operator of the facility to obtain a TSCA PCB approval. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
If, at any time during the facility's operation under the TSCA PCB Coordinated Approval the Regional Administrator
determined that the facility was in violation of any requirement of the Approval (e.g., failure to comply with the
TSCA PCB reporting and recordkeeping requirements, violation of the conditions of a non-TSCA permit or waste management
document, or operation of the facility in a manner that might result in an unreasonable risk of injury to health or the
environment), the Regional Administrator could issue a notice of deficiency, revoke the TSCA PCB Coordinated Approval
or require the owner or operator of the facility to apply for a Federal TSCA PCB approval. The owner or operator of the
facility could continue operations until the TSCA approval was issued; however, a facility could not commence operation
until it received a TSCA PCB approval if it received a notice of deficiency from the Region. The deadline for submitting
the permit application and the Regional Administrator's rationale for requiring a TSCA approval would be reflected
in the Regional Administrator's written notice of deficiency. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
b.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
 Self-implementing approach.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 This approach would allow the owner or operator of a facility with a Federal environmental waste management document
(e.g., signed ROD, final RCRA permit) or State-issued final PCB permit to commence operations after (1) filing EPA
Form 7710&hyph;53 and obtaining an EPA identification number, (2) providing written notification to the Regional
Administrator and (3) receiving confirmation of receipt of that notification from the Region. Under TSCA, the Region
would intervene in the facility's operations only in those instances of non-compliance, for example, with the non-TSCA
permit or TSCA reporting and recordkeeping requirements, or operation of the facility in a manner which would result
in an unreasonable risk. The Federal or State agency issuing the underlying environmental waste management document
would be the lead organization in the development and issuance of that document, monitoring of its implementation
and enforcement of its provisions. EPA's responsibility under TSCA for oversight in those instances would include
enforcement of the TSCA PCB Coordinated Approval rules and could result in the Regional Administrator exercising
his/her authority to require the owner or operator of the facility to obtain a TSCA approval. A detailed description
of the proposed process follows. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Under the self-implementing approach, facilities with a State issued PCB permit or a permit issued by EPA (or an authorized
State Director) under another Federal law administered by EPA for PCB remediation, storage, and disposal activities
would be recognized by EPA as having a TSCA PCB approval provided the permit or other waste management document generally
addresses those disposal activities normally covered by a TSCA PCB approval. Additionally, the facility would have
to be in compliance with the conditions of that permit and the TSCA PCB reporting and recordkeeping requirements of
761.180 and 761.202 through 761.218. Owners or operators of facilities storing or disposing of PCBs pursuant to a
permit issued under another environmental statute such as a CERCLA ROD, a RCRA Corrective Action permit, or an expanded
RCRA-authorized State hazardous waste program would be required to obtain an EPA I.D. number (or confirm an existing
number), provide written notification to the Regional Administrator for the Region in which the facility is located
that they would like to handle PCBs in accordance with a permit that addresses the remediation, storage, and/or disposal
of PCBs and receive written confirmation of receipt of the notification to the Region. A separate formal TSCA PCB approval
would not be required. The owner or operator of the facility could commence operations immediately once an EPA I.D.
number for PCB activities was obtained (or confirmed), written notice was given to the Regional Administrator, and
the Regional Administrator confirmed that the owner's notification had been received. A Region could also respond
with a notice of deficiency in those instances where the Region determines that a TSCA PCB Coordinated Approval is
not available or appropriate and a TSCA PCB approval is needed. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
If, after a TSCA PCB Coordinated Approval has been issued, conditions such as, but not necessarily limited to, the
following exist, the Regional Administrator for the Region in which the facility is located would have sufficient
basis to issue a notice of deficiency and/or require the owner or operator of the facility to submit an application
for a TSCA PCB approval: 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(1) Current or subsequent substantive violations of the permit conditions and/or the TSCA reporting and recordkeeping
requirements. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(2) Operation of a facility in a manner that may result in an unreasonable risk of injury to health or the environment.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(3) The program under which the permit was issued has expired or the permit has been revoked. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(4) For CERCLA actions, requirements conducted pursuant to a ROD have been completed or the facility is not in compliance
with the conditions of the ROD. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In the event the Region required the owner or operator of the facility to obtain a TSCA approval, the Regional Administrator
would establish a deadline for the owner or operator of the facility to submit an application (generally not less than
30 days from receipt of the notice of deficiency) for a TSCA PCB approval. However, the owner or operator of the facility
would be able to continue operations under the provisions of the TSCA PCB Coordinated Approval until the TSCA approval
is issued (except in the instance where a notice of deficiency was issued, then a TSCA PCB approval would first be required).
After issuance of the TSCA approval, EPA would no longer recognize the State or other Federal permit for that facility
as being the equivalent of a TSCA PCB approval. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The primary responsibility for compliance monitoring and enforcement of the permit or waste management document
would reside with the Federal or State agency issuing that permit or waste management document. These underlying
permits or waste management documents would be deemed to be requirements of TSCA whose breach is a prohibited act under
section 15 of TSCA. EPA would reserve its rights to conduct inspections and take enforcement actions under TSCA or
any other applicable Federal statute. It is EPA's intent to exercise its authorities in consultation with or at the
request of the other Federal program or State agency issuing the permit or waste management document. However, based
on any information, EPA could act without consultation, especially where a facility poses an immediate risk of injury
to health or the environment or where EPA's intent is to initiate a criminal investigation or criminal or civil judicial
action. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
EPA proposes to add 761.77 to reflect the interactive approach and solicits comments on the concept of a TSCA PCB Coordinated
Approval and EPA's proposed implementation of this proposal.

 PCB State Enhancement Grants.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 Also cited in the ANPRM was EPA's proposal to make resources, as appropriated by Congress, available through the TSCA
section 28 State grant mechanism. A Notice of Availability for the PCB State Enhancement Grant Program was published
in the 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 -->
Federal Register
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 of March 4, 1991 (56 FR 9008). This notice solicited applications for financial assistance to support current State
activities to establish a PCB disposal program. Funding under this program was not anticipated to continue beyond
fiscal year 1992. Under the State grant proposal, EPA would partially fund efforts by the States to establish a State
PCB disposal program through the development of State legislation and regulations of PCB disposal activities. States
were also required to provide a ``match'' of 25 percent of the total cost of the project. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Several commenters were not in favor of EPA's encouragement of the listing of PCBs under State hazardous waste programs.
Additionally, some commenters voiced concern that EPA was trying to delegate its responsibility to the States to
enforce Federal requirements. And finally, commenters were also skeptical of whether there would be adequate funding
under the grants to implement State disposal programs. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
TSCA grants were to be used as ``seed'' money to complement ongoing State PCB disposal activities. In creating the
TSCA section 28 grant provision, the intent of Congress was to provide financial assistance to selected States to
complement and augment EPA's efforts authorized under the Act (Ref. 55). It had envisioned that those States most
heavily impacted by chemical pollution problems, upon application and approval by EPA, would receive assistance
from EPA. To be eligible for a grant, States would have to be engaged in the process of listing PCBs under its hazardous
waste laws or in adopting TSCA look-alike laws for the storage and/or disposal of PCBs. The process for establishing
a PCB disposal program would have to have been completed by September 30, 1992. Since the response to the 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Section 761.60(e) of the PCB regulations states that persons who are required to incinerate PCBs and PCB Items and
who can demonstrate that an alternate method exists for destroying these PCBs or PCB Items and that this alternate
method can achieve a level of performance equivalent to 761.70 incinerators may submit a written request to the EPA
for an exemption from the incineration requirements of 761.70 or 761.60. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
It was never the Agency's intent that the submission of an application for an alternate disposal method in lieu of incineration
be optional, as could be construed by the use of the word ``may'' in 761.60(e). EPA, therefore, proposes to amend 761.60(e)
to clarify that written approval to use an alternate method of destroying PCBs or PCB Items must be obtained from the
appropriate EPA official prior to any use of the method to destroy PCB waste.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
This rule proposes to clarify the basis on which PCB concentrations are to be determined for the purpose of identifying
applicable requirements under the PCB rules. Proposed 761.1(b) of this rule would require that PCB concentrations
for non-liquid materials, which contain no liquids which pass through the filter when using the paint filter test
method (EPA Method 9095 in ``Test Methods for Evaluating Solid Waste'' (SW&hyph;846), be determined on a dry weight
basis according to the definition proposed at 761.3. The proposed rule would require the PCB concentration to be determined
on a wet weight basis for liquid PCBs as proposed to be defined at 761.3, i.e., homogeneous flowable material containing
PCBs and no more than 0.5 percent non-dissolved materials. This rule would also establish requirements for determining
PCB concentrations in situations where separate, distinct phases were present within samples of materials containing
PCBs. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
On April 6, 1990 (55 FR 12866), EPA published a proposed rule that sought to clarify how to determine the PCB concentration
in media where water is present. However, several comments on the April 6, 1990 proposed rule indicated that it could
be read to require determination of PCB concentrations of all samples, including liquid samples, by removing (drying,
evaporating or condensing) the liquids and thus leaving only PCBs. This Notice responds to those comments by clarifying
the April 6, 1990 proposal and proposes distinct requirements for determining the PCB concentration in liquids,
non-liquids, and multiphasic liquid/liquid and liquid/non-liquid samples. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The April 6, 1990 Notice proposed that PCB concentrations be determined on a dry weight basis for all substances (non-liquids
or liquids) regulated under part 761, including, but not limited to, dielectric fluids, contaminated solvents,
oils, waste oils, heat transfer fluids, hydraulic fluids, paints, sludges, slurries, dredge spoils, soils, materials
contaminated as the result of spills, and other chemical substances or combination of substances, including impurities
and byproducts and any byproduct, intermediate, or impurity manufactured at any point in a process. EPA assumes that
most substances or mixtures, from which samples will be taken for the determination of PCB concentrations by chemical
analysis, will fall into the categories listed above, with the addition of wastewater. Water may be present in some
of these substances or mixtures in varying amounts and for various reasons. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The PCB current regulations do not require a specific chemical analytical method for the determination of PCB concentrations.
Many chemical analysis procedures, used to determine PCB concentrations, require accounting for the presence of
water in samples in a way that accomplishes EPA's objectives in this rule. However, there are some chemical analysis
procedures that could be used for PCBs, but that were developed to address more general objectives. Therefore, these
more general chemical analysis procedures may either offer several options for accounting for water in samples or
require a different way to account for water than would be appropriate for determining the PCB concentration to meet
the requirements and intent of the PCB regulations.

The overall purpose of the proposed revisions to 761.1(b) is to ensure a consistent and reproducible basis for determining
the concentration of PCBs in the PCB-containing medium. Such a basis would enable the Agency to apply the PCB rules
in a consistent manner. To determine the PCB concentration of a nonliquid, as will be discussed below, the medium of
concern is the non-liquid material because it is the most likely repository of the PCBs. Therefore, any water in the
sample should be accounted for in the determination of the PCB concentration of the sample because the amount of water
can significantly bias the PCB concentration in the sample. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
For liquid samples, however, the medium of concern is the liquid itself; therefore, to determine the PCB concentration
in that medium, one may determine the PCB concentration on a wet weight basis. (For example, for water samples, the
medium of concern is the water, and it would not make sense to exclude the water.)

 ``Liquid PCBs'' would be defined in 761.3 as homogenous flowable material containing PCBs and no more than 0.5 percent
by weight non-dissolved materials. The proposed revisions to 761.1(b) would require concentrations for liquid
PCBs to be determined on a wet weight basis. ``Wet weight basis'' means reporting chemical analysis results by including
the weight of all dissolved water in a homogeneous liquid. If the liquid is homogenous, the PCBs will be distributed
throughout the medium evenly. For nonhomogenous liquid samples, however, PCBs are more likely to be more concentrated
in one component of the sample than they are in others because of the physical and chemical properties PCBs possess
(e.g., PCBs are hydrophobic). Thus, for these samples, the proposal would require each phase of a non-homogeneous
liquid to be separately analyzed (on a wet weight basis). EPA recognizes, however, that even if each phase of a liquid
sample is separately analyzed, some small amounts of water that are not separable may be found in a particular phase
(i.e., some small amount of water may be found in oil). 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
For liquid samples containing water, the separable water must be removed, and each phase of the sample must be separately
analyzed (on a wet weight basis). Separable water is water that may be readily physically separated, e.g., by the use
of a separatory funnel, filtration, or by decantation. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
EPA notes that most organic liquids in which PCBs are found (including mineral oil dielectric fluid, heat transfer
fluid, oil based hydraulic fluid, and rinse solvents) usually do not contain more than 1 or 2 percent of non-separable
water. This non-separable water usually is in a suspension or in solution. Since the amount of non-separable water
is usually very low compared to the amount of organic liquid, the effect of non-separable water on the concentration
of PCBs in these organic liquids is relatively small. Thus, EPA believes that allowing the non-separable water to
be included in the analysis would generally not affect the regulatory status of a sample. When there is non-separable
water in an organic liquid, chemical analysts will normally use a desiccant to remove even this small amount of non-separable
water from the liquids during chemical analysis. These small amounts of non-separable water are removed to avoid
potential interference to PCB instrumental response from water and potential damage to the chemical instrumentation.
Even though the small amounts of non-separable water removed by desiccation could be accounted for, they normally
are not accounted for because this non-separable water has limited influence on the PCB concentration of the organic
liquid. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Also, EPA notes that wastewater samples consist almost entirely of non-separable water. For wastewater samples
the analyst will normally use an organic solvent to extract the PCBs from the wastewater. Even though the PCBs are removed
from the water during the determination of the PCB concentration, chemical analysts do not consider this determination
to be on a dry weight basis. Since wastewater may contain significant amounts of suspended materials, this rule proposes
to identify how much suspended material may be present in the water to still be considered a homogenous liquid for the
purpose of determining PCBs in water. If wastewater contains greater than 0.5 percent non-dissolved non-liquids,
the wastewater would be considered to be ``multiphasic liquid/non-liquid.'' If wastewater contained other immiscible
liquids separable by decantation, the PCB concentrations for those other liquids would be considered to be ``multiphasic
liquid/liquid.''

 Non-liquid PCBs.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 ``Non-Liquid PCBs'' are proposed to be defined at 761.3 as PCBs which contain no liquids which pass through the filter
when using the paint filter liquids test method (EPA Method 9095 in ``Test Methods for Evaluating Solid Waste'' (SW&hyph;846).
Proposed 761.1(b) would require PCB concentrations for non-liquid PCBs to be defined on a dry weight basis. ``Dry
weight basis'' would be determined as reporting chemical analysis results by excluding the weight of the water from
the weight of the sample. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In addition, for purposes of this proposal, any chemical analysis process which removes and/or accounts for the amount
of water present in non-liquids complies with the requirement to determine the PCB concentration in non-liquids
on a dry weight basis. These processes include some or all of the following: filtration, decantation, and heating
at low temperatures followed by cooling in the presence of a desiccant. The determination of the PCB concentration
in the non-liquid would be based on the weight of PCBs in the weight of the resulting dried non-liquids. Water separated
from non-liquids through filtration or decantation would be treated as a liquid sample as described in Unit III.M.1.,
``Liquids Including Organic Liquids and Wastewater'' above. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Soils, sediments, and sludges are examples of PCB containing media that can contain varying amounts of water and still
pass the paint filter liquids test for non-liquids. In addition, there are any number of other PCB containing media
such as paper, wet automobile shredder fluff, and other fiber products that can also contain varying amounts of water
and pass the paint filter liquids test for non-liquids as well. These non-liquid PCBs may contain a relatively large
amount of non-separable water compared to the amount of non-separable water that can be contained in the organic liquids
normally encountered in PCB samples. For the purposes of determining PCB concentrations of soils, sediments, and
sludges on a dry weight basis, the amount of water not separated from these non-liquid samples by filtration or decantation
would have to be accounted for in reporting the PCB concentration.

 Mixtures of liquids and/or non-liquids.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 In multiphasic samples, that is, samples containing (a) both non-liquids and liquids or (b) more than one liquid phase,
chemical analysts usually separate non-liquids from liquids and immiscible liquids from each other before chemical
analysis. This separation eliminates the potential consistency and reproducability problems and also provides
meaningful comparisons of PCB concentrations for regulatory purposes. The separation techniques employed in the
laboratory to separate non-liquids from liquids must result in equivalency to the paint filter liquids test in order
to assume a complete separation of liquid and non-liquid materials. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In a sample containing more than one phase, where the phases are capable of being separated from each other (by procedures
such as decantation and filtration), the proposed rule would require the phases to be separated from each other prior
to chemical analysis, and the PCB concentration for each separate phase of the mixture sample to be determined individually.
Separated non-liquids would be required to be analyzed on a dry weight basis and liquids would be required to be analyzed
on a wet weight basis.

N. Oil-filled Equipment Manufactured After the Ban 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
In the applicability section of part 761 at 761.1, EPA is proposing to add paragraph (g) to provide clarification with
regard to the classification of oil-filled equipment manufactured after the ban on the manufacture of PCBs took effect
on July 2, 1979. The purpose of this clarification is to recognize that oil-filled equipment manufactured after the
ban, accompanied either by documentation provided by the manufacturer or a label or mark affixed by the manufacturer
certifying, based on test data, that the equipment does not contain PCBs, does not fall into the assumption category,
under the definition of ``PCB-Contaminated Electrical Equipment'' at current 761.3, that all oil-filled equipment
where PCB concentration is unknown must be assumed to be greater than 50 ppm PCBs. For purposes of this proposed rulemaking,
the criteria for demonstrating that the transformer contains no PCBs are: the equipment must have been originally
manufactured with no PCBs after the effective date of the ban (July 2, 1979), and must not have been serviced with any
PCBs. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
At Unit III.C. of this preamble, EPA is proposing to amend the definition of ``PCB-Contaminated Electrical Equipment''
to indicate that the reference to ``oil-filled'' means mineral-oil and that not all equipment that contains an oily
substance can be assumed to be PCB-Contaminated. Similarly, proposed 761.1(g), would clarify that oil-filled (mineral
or otherwise) equipment that was manufactured after the ban on the manufacture of PCBs that was certified to contain
no PCBs at the time of manufacture and has not been subsequently serviced with fluids containing PCBs should not and
will not be assumed to be PCB-Contaminated. In fact, this equipment is not subject to the provisions of 40 CFR part 761.

O. PCB Voltage Regulators 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The current regulation at 761.30(a)(1)(xv) requires owners of mineral oil transformers that the owner had assumed
to contain 50 to 499 ppm PCBs, that are tested and found to contain 500 ppm or greater PCBs, to bring those units into compliance
with all the applicable provisions of part 761. EPA is proposing at 761.30(a)(1)(xvi) the same requirements for voltage
regulators. Accordingly, voltage regulators, assumed to be PCB-Contaminated, that are later tested and found to
contain 500 ppm PCB or greater would be required to come into compliance with part 761. Voltage regulators which were
marked or otherwise known to contain PCBs at greater than 500 ppm would also be required to come into compliance with
all the applicable requirements of part 761. Section 761.30(h) would also be revised to reflect this change. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In many respects, voltage regulators are designed to function in a manner similar to transformers. They consume a
small amount of current and adjust their output voltage with precise limits based on voltage and current needs of the
power system. Though the actual size and fluid requirements of voltage regulators vary depending upon precise voltage
rating, age, and manufacturer, voltage regulators of less than 100 KVA contain approximately 30 gallons of fluid
and those over 100 KVA approximately 200 gallons. Voltage regulators were manufactured with mineral-oil fluid of
which 14 percent contained PCBs greater than or equal to 50 ppm and less than 2 percent contained greater than or equal
to 500 ppm PCBs. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Based on this data, EPA does not expect many voltage regulators to be above the 500 ppm PCB level; however, as with mineral-oil
transformers later tested and found to contain above 500 ppm PCB, those that were found to be 500 ppm or greater would
be treated in the same manner as transformers at 500 ppm or greater. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The impetus for this proposal is to ensure that voltage regulators that are found to contain 500 ppm or greater PCBs
are properly marked while in service, their locations are marked, records are kept pursuant to 761.180, they are registered
with fire departments, and they are properly disposed of when they are taken out of service. As well as soliciting comments
on this proposed change in general, EPA is soliciting comments on the appropriateness of requiring enhanced electrical
protection for voltage regulators as is the case for mineral-oil transformers later found to contain greater than
or equal to 500 ppm PCBs. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In addition, EPA is soliciting comments on whether it is sufficient to simply add voltage regulators to existing 761.30(a)(1)(xv)
(renumbered in this proposed rule as 761.30(a)(1)(xvi)) or whether a separate subparagraph should be added to address
this issue because voltage regulators containing greater than or equal to 500 ppm PCB should not be treated in the same
manner as PCB Transformers. If there are compelling reasons to treat these voltage regulators differently due, for
example, to their size, location, or use, EPA welcomes suggestions on the most appropriate way to regulate these pieces
of PCB electrical equipment.

Pursuant to section 18(b) of TSCA, the State of Connecticut petitioned EPA for an exemption from the preemption provisions
of section 18(a)(2) to allow the State to require, among other things, the registration of PCB Transformers (i.e.,
transformers with dielectric fluid at 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=6 f=2 -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
500 ppm PCB) with the Connecticut Department of Environmental Protection. Connecticut argued that this notification
would provide a significantly higher degree of protection for State residents and emergency response personnel
from the risks posed by PCB Transformers than the current Federal rules under TSCA because (1) State emergency response
personnel often respond to fires and spills at sites throughout the State and (2) State administrative actions such
as issuing warnings regarding fishing, swimming, or other activities that could increase human exposure to PCBs
when fires or spills occur, could be made in a more timely manner. While EPA sees merit in these arguments, EPA believes
that residents of every State would be better protected by a uniform, nationwide registration requirement, where
EPA would receive the data and make it available to Federal and State emergency response personnel. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Today's rule proposes a new 761.30(a)(1)(vii) to require all owners of PCB Transformers to register their transformers
with the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency, Office of Enforcement and Compliance Assistance (2245), 401 M St.,
SW., Washington, DC 20460 no later than 90 days after the effective date of the final rule. PCB Transformers subsequently
identified or received from another location would have to be registered with EPA no later than 30 days after identification
or receipt. To minimize data gathering and processing, EPA proposes that transformer owners would only have to report
information about their transformers that is currently required under 761.180(a), to be included on their annual
document logs. The registration would include the following information: (1) Transformer location (address) and
number of PCB Transformers, (2) kilograms of PCB liquid in each PCB Transformer, and (3) name, address, telephone
number and signature of the owner, operator, or other authorized representative certifying the accuracy of the information
submitted. If a PCB Transformer is transferred to a different location after it is registered, information concerning
that transfer would be recorded in the former owner's annual document log. (See discussion at Unit III.E._Transfer
of Totally Enclosed PCBs.) Anyone who took possession, either through transfer of location or sale of a PCB Transformer,
90 days after the effective date of this rule would be responsible for demonstrating that the newly acquired PCB Transformer
was registered with EPA under this proposed provision or, if the new owner could not make that demonstration, he would
have to register that PCB Transformer within 30 days of the transfer. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The regulations at 761.30(a)(1)(vi) and (vii) currently include requirements for registering all PCB Transformers
with fire response personnel and owners of any nearby commercial buildings. State and local authorities may also
have notification requirements for emergency response personnel. Owners of transformers at industrial sites could
fulfill the current requirement by registering with their on-site fire brigade, while owners of PCB Transformers
in or near commercial buildings had to register with the local fire department. Subsequent review of the regulated
community's compliance with these registration requirements by the Office of the Inspector General of EPA and EPA
Regional personnel found that many fire departments, including those serving large cities, had not received registration
information for a large percentage of those PCB Transformers which should have been registered. In addition, many
owners could not demonstrate that they had registered their transformers, as required to continue each unit's authorization
for use. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Therefore, the registration requirements proposed today would extend to all PCB Transformers in use or in storage
for reuse, even if a specific PCB Transformer was registered under the current requirements at 761.30(a)(1). Under
proposed 761.30(a)(1)(vii)(C), this requirement would be a part of the authorization for continued use for each
PCB Transformer. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
EPA solicits comments on this proposal and the petition from the State of Connecticut. If EPA does not promulgate today's
proposed uniform national registration requirements, then it would be inclined to promulgate an exemption under
section 18(b) to allow any State to implement its own registration requirements for transformers.

Q. Rectifiers 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
It has come to EPA's attention that a certain number of oil-filled and solid-state rectifiers (devices that convert
AC current to DC current) contain PCBs. While rectifiers are not specifically authorized for use in the PCB regulations,
it is EPA's intent to authorize at proposed 761.30(r), the continued use of rectifiers in a similar manner as transformers
to be consistent with EPA's use authorizations for non-totally enclosed electrical equipment. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
To add specificity to this proposed authorization for rectifiers, EPA is soliciting comments and data on the following:
(1) The number of rectifiers currently in use, (2) the extent of PCB contamination in rectifiers, (3) the size of such
units and whether EPA should adopt a 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 volume amount (as is the case with capacitors, i.e., capacitors with less than 3 pounds of fluid are considered small
and generally not regulated under TSCA for disposal) at which rectifiers would be regulated under TSCA, (4) the number
of oil-filled vs. solid state rectifiers, and (5) any information that will assist EPA in supporting a use authorization
for this type of equipment. Proposed 761.30(r) would authorize PCBs at any concentration to be used in rectifiers
and PCBs at less than 50 ppm to be used in servicing rectifiers for the remainder of their useful life.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
It has come to EPA's attention that certain types of scientific equipment have historically used PCBs as a medium for
comparative measurements. Specifically, EPA has been made aware of the historic use of PCBs in studies of birefringence
and viscoelasticity of long chain polymers (Ref. 58). The PCBs serve as a high viscosity medium to uniformly reduce
all movement to facilitate comparisons of long-chain polymers. These studies date back to well before the enactment
of TSCA and have included hundreds of thousands of comparable reference data runs. Other media could be used to replace
PCBs in these instruments, but none yield results comparable to the large historical reference data set using PCBs
as reference standards. While PCBs are not specifically authorized for specialized uses in scientific equipment,
it is EPA's intent to authorize at proposed 761.30(s), their continued use in situations where the PCBs were in use
as of the date of publication of today's proposal. Additional information is requested as to why substitutes are not
available or otherwise could not be used and why the continued use of PCBs presents no unreasonable risk to health and
the environment. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In order to add specificity to this proposed authorization, EPA is soliciting comments and data on the following:
(1) The types and number of scientific applications for which PCBs are currently in use; (2) explanations as to why
substitutes can not be used in each identified scientific application; (3) the size of such units and whether EPA should
adopt a 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 volume amount; (4) the types of PCBs used; (5) descriptions of how releases and exposures to PCBs are minimized during
preparation, operation, and disassembly of the testing equipment; and (6) any additional information that will
assist EPA in supporting a use authorization for PCBs in scientific equipment. In all authorized and unauthorized
scientific uses or applications of PCBs, the disposal of the PCBs and any contaminated equipment is fully regulated
under TSCA.

S. Remove Outdated Material 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
In response to a request to remove outdated material from the Code of Federal Regulations, EPA is proposing to remove
the provisions at 761.20(c)(3) that require the submission to EPA of a notice at least 30 days prior to the export for
disposal of PCBs or PCB Items; the regulations had authorized export for disposal until May 1, 1980. In deleting the
notification requirement, EPA proposes to retain the prohibition against exporting PCBs for disposal after May
1, 1980, as reflected at 761.20(c)(3) in today's notice. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Likewise, several use authorizations specified deadlines by which certain activities were to cease. Section 761.30(a)(1)(iii),
which prohibits the installation of PCB Transformers in or near commercial buildings after October 1, 1985, contains
provisions for the continued installation of such transformers in emergency situations or for reclassification
up until October 1, 1990. Since these provisions are now obsolete, EPA is proposing their removal, with the exception
of the provision to allow the indefinite installation of Mineral Oil PCB Transformers, which is still valid and would
be retained. Therefore, 761.30(a)(1)(iii)(A) through (D) would be deleted, with the exception of the requirements
of 761.30(a)(1)(iii)(C)(2)(ii) and (C)(2)(iii), which would be retained and redesignated as 761.30(a)(1)(iii)(A)
and (iii)(B), respectively. The definition of ``emergency situation'' under 761.3 would therefore be rendered
unnecessary and also would be deleted. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The provisions at 761.30(b), which authorize the use in and servicing of railroad transformers, contain procedures
for phasing in a reduction of the PCB concentration for dielectric fluids used in railroad transformers. Essentially,
the use of greater than 1,000 ppm PCBs in these transformers was prohibited after July 1, 1986. Therefore, EPA is proposing
to amend paragraph (b)(1) by deleting paragraphs (b)(1)(i) through (b)(1)(vii) at 761.30(b)(1) ``Use restrictions.''
Paragraph (b)(1) would be amended to restrict the use of PCBs in the dielectric fluids of railroad transformers to

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=6 f=2 -->
&lt;
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
1,000 ppm after July 1, 1986 (as is currently required by 761.30(b)(1)(vi)). Further, EPA is proposing to delete 761.30(b)(2)(ii)
``Servicing restrictions.'' and to redesignate 761.30(b)(2)(iii) through (vii) as (b)(2)(ii) through (vi). The
provisions at 761.30(c) ``Use in and servicing of mining equipment'' would be revised to delete the conditions listed
at paragraphs (c)(1) through (c)(5) since the timeframe of the authorization for the use and servicing of mining equipment
containing PCBs has lapsed and these conditions are no longer relevant. The introductory paragraph for 761.30(c)
would also be amended to delete the processing and distribution in commerce servicing authorization for PCBs greater
than 50 ppm used in mining equipment which expired on January 1, 1982. The authorization would be revised to allow servicing
only with PCBs at a concentration level of less than 50 ppm. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Sections 761.30(d)(1) through (d)(5) set conditions on the use of PCBs at concentrations of 50 ppm or greater prior
to July 1, 1984. The recordkeeping requirement under paragraph (d)(5) expired on July 1, 1989 (5 years after the deadline).
Therefore, paragraphs (d)(1) through (d)(5) are effectively obsolete, and EPA is proposing their deletion. Similar
provisions for hydraulic systems under 761.30(e)(1) through (e)(5) are also being proposed for removal. The introductory
paragraphs for 761.30(d) and 761.30(e) would be amended to allow heat transfer or hydraulic systems that were in operation
after July 1, 1984 at a concentration level of less than 50 ppm PCBs to be serviced to maintain a concentration level
of less than 50 ppm PCBs. This action is being proposed so that heat transfer and hydraulic systems that were in compliance
(containing less than 50 ppm PCBs in their fluids) could be serviced to maintain PCB levels at less than 50 ppm should
the PCB levels rise above 50 ppm because of leaching from the systems. Heat transfer and hydraulic systems could only
be serviced with fluids containing PCBs at less than 50 ppm.

IV. Proposed Amendments to the Notification and Manifesting Rule 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Since the promulgation of the PCB Notification and Manifesting (N&amp;M) rule on December 21, 1989 (54 FR 52716) a
number of issues have been raised that were not contemplated when the final rule was being drafted. Some of these issues
were raised by litigants who petitioned the Agency for review of the rule or by other waste handling associations.
Other items which are being proposed in today's notice have been previously promulgated under RCRA regulations and
seem appropriate for inclusion in the PCB N&amp;M rule. Some of the issues below are simply clarifications and are
not intended to result in changes to the codified sections of 40 CFR part 761. EPA is soliciting comments on the following
proposed amendments and clarifications to the PCB N&amp; 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
M rule. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 -->
A. Small Quantity Exemption for Solids 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
On June 27, 1990 (55 FR 26204), EPA issued a correction to the N&amp;M rule that among other things sought to clarify
the definition of ``Commercial storer of PCB waste'' at 761.3. The word ``liquid'' was added to the phrase ``exceeds
500 gallons of PCBs'' so that the phrase now reads ``exceeds 500 liquid gallons of PCBs.'' This excluded facilities
that were storing at any one time less than 500 gallons of liquid PCB waste from the need to seek approval as a commercial
storer of that waste. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In a petition for review of the N&amp;M rule, filed with the District of Columbia Circuit Court of Appeals on September
25, 1990, the petitioner claimed that EPA acted arbitrarily when it narrowed the small volume exemption in the definition
of commercial storer so that only storers of liquid PCB wastes at amounts of less than 500 gallons would qualify. EPA
agreed that there were certain classes of businesses (e.g., companies performing PCB waste treatability studies
and laboratories affiliated with PCB handling companies) that on occasion may possess relatively small quantities
of solid PCB waste generated by others. Under the current rule, these companies do not qualify for the exemption for
small quantity liquid and, therefore, must apply for approval as commercial storers of PCB waste. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
EPA agreed there may be reasons for establishing a small quantity exemption for solids to complement the rule's small
quantity exemption for liquids. EPA also indicated to the petitioner that until a formal amendment to the rule was
promulgated, no enforcement action would be taken against a facility storing small quantities of PCB solids without
a commercial storage approval if the following requirements were met: 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(1) Timely notification to EPA of its PCB waste activities. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(2) Storage at no time of more than 70 cubic feet of PCB solid waste, the approximate volumetric equivalent of 500 gallons.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(3) Compliance with all other applicable requirements as set forth in TSCA or the PCB rules. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
This proposed rule would add a small volume exemption for storage of no more than 70 cubic feet of non-liquid PCBs to
the definition of ``commercial storer of PCB waste'' at 761.3. EPA is soliciting comments on the appropriateness
of this small volume exemption for solids and in particular, whether 70 cubic feet is an appropriate cutoff. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Also in the proposed amendment to the definition of commercial storer at 761.3, EPA is clarifying a point on the change
of ownership or release of title of PCB waste and how that relates to a person becoming or not becoming a commercial storer
of PCB waste. The following example illustrates the proposed clarification. If a facility that generates and stores
its own waste (e.g., transformers) is sold (or the title otherwise changes ownership), the new owner (or holder of
the title) does not become a commercial storer of PCB waste because the owner is now a storer of waste generated by someone
else. The waste, along with the facility, is now owned by the purchaser, and the purchaser is storing its own waste;
therefore the purchaser is not a commercial storer.

B. Clarification of Exception Reporting 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
EPA is proposing to amend 761.215(b), (c), and (d), which discuss the times when a generator, commercial storer, or
disposer must submit One-year Exception Reports to the EPA Regional Administrator. Currently, a disposer is required
to submit a One-year Exception Report whenever both of the following occur: 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(1) The PCB waste is received on a date more than 9 months from the date the PCB waste was removed from service for disposal
as indicated on the manifest. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(2) The disposer could not dispose of the PCB waste within 1 year from the date of removal from service for disposal.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
A generator is required to submit the Exception Report when a copy of the manifest with the hand-written signature
of the owner or operator of the designated facility has not been received within 45 days of the date the waste was accepted
by the original transporter. Also, a generator or commercial storer who manifests PCBs or PCB Items to a disposer of
PCB waste must submit the Exception Report when both of the following occur: 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(1) The waste was transferred to the disposer within 9 months of the date of removal from service for disposal as indicated
on the manifest. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(2) The generator or commercial storer has not received within 13 months from the date of removal for disposal a Certificate
of Disposal (CD) or they receive the CD and it indicates that the waste was disposed of on a date more than 1 year after
the date of removal from service for disposal. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
These sections of the regulation do not, however, indicate when the disposer, commercial storer, or generator has
to submit the One-year Exception Report to the Regional Administrator. EPA is proposing to amend 761.215(b), (c),
and (d) to require that the disposer, commercial storer, or generator submit the One-year Exception Report to the
Regional Administrator no later than 30 days from the discovery of the passage of the regulatory deadlines. EPA solicits
comments on the appropriateness of the proposed 30&hyph;day period. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 -->
C. Timing for Submission of the Certificate of Disposal 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Section 761.218(b) requires that a Certificate of Disposal (CD) be sent to the generator indicated on the manifest
that accompanied the shipment of PCB waste to the disposal facility within 30 days of the date that disposal of the PCB
waste identified on the manifest was completed. Section 761.215(d)(2) indicates that one of the occasions when a
generator or commercial storer should submit a One-year Exception Report to the Regional Administrator is when the
CD is not received from the disposer within 13 months from the date of removal from service for disposal (DORFSFD).

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
EPA wishes to clarify that there may be different DORFSFD dates for different individual items on any given manifest.
This means that some items listed on the manifest will need to be disposed of earlier than others to meet the 1&hyph;year
time limit for storage and disposal. Due to the fact that there may be different disposal dates for different items
on the same manifest, there will also be different CDs associated with those different disposal dates (unless of course,
the entire shipment listed on the manifest is disposed of before the 1&hyph;year anniversary of the item with the earliest
DORFSFD). The generator may either submit more than one manifest per shipment based on whether or not there are different
DORFSFDs for the items in the shipment or attach a continuation sheet to reflect the different DORFSFDs. This may be
time consuming initially, but will ensure that the generator receives a proper CD that identifies the specific PCB
Items (noting the generator's identifying number, if assigned) to close the disposal loop on the generated waste.
EPA wants to make clear that it is not appropriate to base the disposal of the item on the manifest with the latest DORFSFD
or, correspondingly, to send the CD based on that item.

EPA proposes to amend 761.207(j). This section describes what wastes, based on PCB concentration and factoring in
whether or not dilution has occurred, are subject to the manifesting requirements. The section now states that if
the waste contains less than 50 ppm PCBs, but comes from a source that contained greater than 50 ppm PCBs, the waste is
subject to the manifesting and disposal requirements. Cited as an example is PCB spill cleanup material containing
less than 50 ppm when the spill involved material containing greater than 50 ppm. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The proposed amendment at 761.207(j) would specify that there is no manifest requirement for material currently
below 50 ppm that derives from pre-April 18, 1978, spills (of any concentration) or pre-July 2, 1979 spills less than
500 ppm. This is because (1) the material ``as found'' is below the regulatory threshold that would make it subject
to the disposal requirements of subpart D, and (2) the original spilled material was either below or not subject to
the disposal requirements of part 761, subpart D at the time of the original spill. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In addition, the manifest requirement does not apply to material derived from spills that have been decontaminated
in accordance with EPA's spill cleanup policies. In other words, material containing PCBs that has been decontaminated
to the policy standards to a level below 50 ppm would not be treated as if it contained greater than 50 ppm PCBs for disposal
purposes, and could be disposed of in a municipal landfill or by other non-PCB disposal methods. This position is consistent
with EPA's regulations that permit material that has been contaminated as the result of a spill of PCBs to be distributed
in commerce if the material is decontaminated in accordance with the applicable spill cleanup policies. (See 40 CFR
761.20(c)(5).) 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
EPA is soliciting comments on the proposed amendment to 761.207(j) to make it clear as to when one does or does not have
to manifest PCB waste material that is less than 50 ppm.

E. Notification by Transporters 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
It has come to the Agency's attention that there is some confusion in the regulated community as to whether a subcontractor
or a ``permanently leased operator'' can use the EPA Identification Number (EPA ID number) issued to an unrelated
company that has notified as a transporter. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Since any person engaged in the transportation of regulated PCB waste must, under current 761.205, apply for and receive
an EPA ID number, a ``permanently leased operator'' or a subcontractor must notify separately and receive a separate
and distinct EPA ID number to transport PCB waste. The intent of the PCB N&amp;M rule would be subverted if this were
not the case. The Agency would have no record of who was doing the actual physical transport of PCB waste. Theoretically,
a company could apply for a master ID number that could be used by hundreds of permanently leased operators or subcontractors.
This would be clearly contrary to the intent of the N&amp;M rule which is to have a record of each PCB waste handler. The
regulations at 761.3 define a ``Transporter of PCB waste'' as ``...any person engaged in the transportation of regulated
PCB waste ...'' and 761.205 requires that all transporters notify EPA of their PCB waste handling activities.

F. Renotification for Changes in Facility Operations 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Sections 761.202 and 761.205 discuss who must obtain an EPA ID number and how to obtain such an ID number through the
use of EPA Form 7710&hyph;53. EPA wishes to clarify that when a facility has previously notified the Agency of its PCB
waste handling activities using EPA Form 7710&hyph;53 and those activities change (e.g., the owner or operator of
the facility notified EPA as a commercial storer and now wants to engage in the transport of PCB waste, or notified as
a transporter and a commercial storer but no longer wishes to engage in the activity of transporting PCB waste), the
notifier must resubmit EPA Form 7710&hyph;3 to reflect those changes. Other examples of when a PCB waste handler must
renotify the Agency include, but are not limited to, when the company stops handling PCB waste or changes the facility's
location. Indication in a cover letter or on the form itself that this is a resubmission based on changes in facility
operations and not a new submission will help to facilitate the process. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
EPA is proposing to add this requirement for resubmission of EPA Form 7710&hyph;53 when there is a change in a facility's
status to new 761.205(f). EPA is proposing that the resubmission be submitted to EPA no later than 5 work days after
the change was made.

G. Transfer of Ownership of Commercial Storage Facilities 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
EPA is proposing to amend 761.65 by adding a new paragraph (j) to include language on the procedures and timing associated
with the transfer of ownership of a commercial storage facility. The timing and procedures would apply to facilities
with either interim or final approval. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Existing commercial storage facilities had until August 2, 1990, to submit a completed application to EPA and receive
interim status to operate until the application was formally approved or denied. Section 761.65(d)(3) describes
the information that must be included in the application, such as a closure plan, closure cost estimate, and financial
assurance for closure. The N&amp;M rule did not, however, discuss procedures and criteria for transferring ownership
of a facility with interim status or final approval to operate (as is the case under the regulation implementing RCRA
at 40 CFR 270.72(a)(4)). The Agency is soliciting comments on the following proposed procedure as a way to address
the issue of transfer of ownership of commercial storage facilities. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Agency would recognize the transfer of interim status or final approval for commercial storage facilities if
all the following conditions were met: 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(1) The transferee demonstrated it had established, by the date of transfer, financial assurance for closure pursuant
to 761.65(g) using a mechanism effective as of the date of final approval. This would assure that there would be no lapse
in financial assurance for the transferred facility. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(2) The transferee submitted a new and complete application for final storage approval. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(3) Any significant deficiencies (e.g., technical operations, closure plans, cost estimates) that EPA had identified
in the application of the transferor, were resolved in the new application by either the transferor or by the transferee.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The new application would also have to include all the elements listed in 40 CFR 761.65(d)(3), including but not limited
to, a demonstration that the applicant and its principal and key employees were qualified to engage in the business
of commercial storage of PCB waste, the facility had the capacity to handle the PCB waste estimated by the applicant,
certification of compliance with the storage facility standards at 761.65(b) and/or (c)(7), a written closure plan,
demonstration of financial responsibility for closure, demonstration that operation of the facility would not
present an unreasonable risk of injury to health or the environment, and the environmental compliance history of
the applicant and its principals and key employees. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Before the transfer of interim status or final approval could occur, EPA would have to review the new application and
deem it ``complete,'' i.e., all the required elements were included in the application. The application would also
have to correct any significant deficiencies previously identified. Of course, EPA would reserve the right to deny
the transfer of the interim approval status or final approval if upon interim review of the new application, EPA determined
that the transferee was not qualified or was unable or unwilling to achieve and maintain its operations in compliance
with TSCA and the PCB rules. In addition, a determination by the EPA Regional Administrator that the transfer of interim
status or final approval could occur would not be determinative of the final decision that would be made regarding
the commercial storage application. EPA would also reserve the right to deny any subsequent transfer request respecting
a particular facility if EPA believed that such a transfer was undertaken to avoid the requirement of seeking a final
commercial storage approval. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The requirements proposed above would have to be met before EPA would recognize the transfer of interim status. For
example, Company ``X'' is interested in acquiring ownership of Company ``Y'', which has interim status to operate
as a commercial storer of PCB waste. If EPA does not recognize the transfer of interim status before Company ``X'' takes
legal title of ownership of the facility from Company ``Y'', Company ``X'' may be in violation of the commercial storage
regulations because it did not have interim status to operate at the time it took legal title. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
To facilitate the transfer of ownership, the Agency also solicits comments on whether a ``new'' application is entirely
necessary. If, for example, the transferee accepted the contents of the old application, the only parts of the application
that would have to be amended (excluding any deficiencies that have yet to be corrected) would be the financial assurance
for closure, a new list of principles and key employees, and the compliance history of any business with which those
individuals had been affiliated in the preceding 5 years. This submission of an ``amended'' application would save
both the transferee and the EPA time and money and ultimately facilitate the transfer process.

H. Modifications to Storage Facilities 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Section 761.65(e)(4) discusses when a commercial storage facility must submit a request to EPA for a modification
to its storage approval to amend its closure plan. The Agency is proposing a similar requirement for revising the financial
assurance for closure when there are modifications to the commercial storage facility, for example, where the facility
is enlarged and the maximum inventory of waste increases sufficiently to warrant an increase to the financial assurance
mechanism. EPA is proposing to add 761.65(g)(9) to indicate that when a modification to the storage facility occurs
that warrants establishing a new financial assurance mechanism or amending the existing financial assurance mechanism,
the owner or operator shall have established and activated the new financial assurance mechanism no later than 30
days after the Regional Administrator (or Director, CMD) is notified of the completion of the modification of the
facility, but prior to the use of the modified portion of the facility. In addition, the Regional Administrator (or
Director, CMD) would have to be notified in writing no later than 7 days of completion of the modification to the facility.
EPA is also soliciting comments on the appropriateness of adding those requirements to the existing language at 761.65(f)(3)
since this section also addresses modifications (in this case closure) rather than adding a new paragraph (g)(9)
to 761.65.

I. Clarification of Which Disposers Must Submit Annual Reports 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Section 761.180(b)(3) requires that each owner or operator of a PCB disposal or commercial storage facility shall
submit an annual report to the Regional Administrator of the EPA Region in which the facility is located by July 15 of
each year, that briefly summarizes the records and annual document log required to be maintained and prepared under
paragraphs (b)(1) and (b)(2) of that section. Sections 761.180(b)(1) and (b)(2) are recordkeeping requirements
including information obtained from manifests that are generated or received by the facility. If a disposal facility
disposed of only its own waste and, therefore, never received or generated a manifest, it would still have to prepare
an annual document log as per the requirements at 761.180(b)(2)(iii). However, the annual report requirements of
761.180(b)(3) should not be misinterpreted as not applying to such a facility simply because they do not receive or
generate manifests. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
It was not the intent of the Agency to exclude disposers of PCB waste as defined at 761.3 who dispose of their own waste
from the requirement to submit an annual report. To remedy this discrepancy, EPA is proposing amendments to 761.180(b)(3)
that would state that a disposer's obligation to submit an annual report is based on the act of disposing of PCB waste
material and not necessarily whether or not manifests were received or generated at the facility. This should clarify
EPA's intent on receiving annual reports from all disposers of PCB waste, including those disposing of their own waste.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
EPA is proposing to reference 40 CFR 264.143(f)(10) of the regulations implementing RCRA (final rule September 16,
1992, 57 FR 42832) to add an additional financial assurance mechanism for closure of PCB commercial storage facilities.
This mechanism allows for the corporate guarantor to also be a firm with a ``substantial business relationship''
(as in RCRA Subtitle C) with the owner or operator of the commercial storage facility. This additional financial mechanism
would be added to 761.65(g) by adding it as paragraph (g)(7) and redesignating existing paragraph (g)(7) as paragraph
(g)(8).

 General.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 The PCB N&amp;M rule requires that generators prepare (761.207(a)) and transporters sign and date (761.208(b)(2))
a manifest for each shipment of PCB waste. The rule exempts ``laboratory samples'' from the manifesting requirements
when the samples are, among other things, ``being transported to a laboratory for purposes of testing'' (761.65(i)(2)).
The Agency's policy is that media containing PCBs at >50 ppm which are being sent to validate PCB disposal methods are
not subject to the manifesting requirements of 761.207 and 761.208. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Unlike the requirements promulgated for hazardous wastes under RCRA at 40 CFR 261.4, the final PCB N&amp;M rule did
not include an exemption from the manifesting requirements for treatability study samples. While the N&amp;M rule
adopted almost verbatim 40 CFR 261.4(d) regarding laboratory samples, it did not incorporate 40 CFR 261.4(e) regarding
treatability study samples. Accordingly, at this time, the exemption applies only to PCB samples sent to a laboratory
to determine concentration. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Under the existing TSCA requirements, the treatability medium is not an exempt ``laboratory sample'' for two reasons.
First, the medium is not being transported ``for the purposes of testing''. The preamble to the N&amp;M Rule strongly
suggests that ``for purposes of testing'' means analysis to determine the sample's concentration (e.g., is it 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=6 f=2 -->
;
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
50 ppm?). As the preamble to the N&amp;M rule states, samples that are sent to a laboratory to determine the PCB concentration
are implicitly authorized for use and not subject to the disposal requirements until the analysis is complete or use
in an enforcement case has ended. (See 54 FR 52716, 52719 (Unit III.D.), December 21, 1989.) Treatability studies,
on the other hand, are in essence small-scale disposal experiments and not efforts solely to determine PCB concentration.
The concentration of treatability media is already known to be greater than 50 ppm. The purpose of testing is not to
determine the PCB concentration but to determine whether the disposal method under review works. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In addition, the preamble makes it clear that to be exempt from the requirements of the N&amp;M rule, laboratories
must be ``independent'' from any company whose activities involve PCB waste handling, storage, treatment, and disposal.
Where the entities receiving the media containing PCBs are themselves engaged in treatment and disposal activities
and are affiliated with companies whose other activities also involve PCBs, they would be unable to satisfy the definition
of ``laboratory'' in 761.3.

 Definitions

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
. In order to promote regulatory uniformity with the exemption for treatability study samples under RCRA and to help
promote and facilitate research and development into alternate disposal and treatment technologies for PCB waste,
the Agency is proposing a new self-implementing PCB disposal approval at 761.60(j) for research and development
for PCB disposal of limited quantities of PCBs, including treatability studies, and to add 761.80(i) to create a class
exemption for processors and distributors of limited quantities of media containing PCBs for research and development.
This disposal approval is explained in greater detail in unit II.D.3.j. of the preamble and the class exemption is
explained in greater detail in Unit III.J. of this preamble. In addition, EPA is proposing to amend 761.3 to add the
definition of ``Treatability Study'' that would essentially mirror the existing definition under RCRA at 40 CFR
260.10. Treatment is a form of disposal under the PCB rules.

L. Clarification of the Term ``Facility'' 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
In today's proposed rule, the Agency is soliciting comments on the need to clarify the terms ``facility'' and ``facilities''.
The term is used in different contexts throughout the regulatory text of 40 CFR part 761. The impetus for the Agency
raising this need for a clarification of the term arose after reviewing a section of preamble language in the PCB Notification
and Manifesting rule (54 FR 52716). In the preamble on page 52722, column 2, the discussion focusses on the requirement
for generators with on-site storage facilities to notify the Agency of their PCB waste handling activities. The first
two sentences in the last paragraph read, ``In submitting their notifications to EPA, members of this class of generator/storer
will submit a notification form for each of their storage areas that is subject to  761.65. EPA will issue a unique identification
number to each notifying storage facility, and this identification number will correspond to the physical location
of the facility.'' 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Here the terms ``storage area'' and ``storage facility'' are used interchangeably; in the first case to mean a particular
building, structure, cell, or unit, and in the second instance, all structures on contiguous land or specified piece
of property. As a matter of record, it was not the Agency's intent to require notification for each storage unit on the
contiguous piece of property, which would result in multiple, individual identification numbers for that property.
The facility, regardless of the number of storage areas or units on the piece of property, need only notify once for
that contiguous piece of property. Therefore, in this instance, the term facility means, all contiguous land and
structures used for the storage of PCB waste. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
There are, however, other sections of the PCB regulations where the term facility means an individual unit or structure;
most notably at 761.65(b)(1). Here the regulation states that a facility used for the storage of PCBs and PCB Items
shall have an adequate roof, walls, and floor; continuous curbing with a minimum 6 inch high curb; no floor drains or
expansions joints, etc.; and shall not be located at a site below the 100&hyph;year flood water elevation. It is clear
in this instance that the Agency is not referring to a contiguous piece of property but to an individual structure or
unit. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In the vast majority of cases in 40 CFR part 761, the term facility refers to the contiguous piece of property including
the structures or individual storage or disposal units on that property. There are, however, 10 or so citations in
the PCB regulations where the term facility refers only to the individual unit or structure. It is these 10 places in
the regulation where EPA is proposing to delete the term facility and insert a term whose definition will best represent
the Agency's intent (i.e., an individual unit, structure, or building). The Agency solicits comments on the most
appropriate term to convey this meaning. For purposes of this proposed rule, the term ``unit'' will be used to indicate
this change in the proposed regulatory text. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In addition, the Agency welcomes comments if it has inadvertently omitted a section or sections of the regulations
where the term facility should be deleted and the term ``unit'' inserted or for that matter made a change where one was
not appropriate.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
All comments will be placed in the public record unless the commenter claims that they contain confidential business
information (CBI) and the comments are clearly labeled as containing information claimed as CBI at the time of submission.
Because of the need to expedite the review of any CBI claims, each claim must be accompanied by detailed comments substantiating
the claim as described in 40 CFR 2.204(e)(4). While a part of the public record, comments claimed as CBI will be treated
in accordance with 40 CFR part 2. A sanitized version of all comments subject to CBI claims must be submitted to EPA for
the public record by the close of the comment period. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
It is the responsibility of the commenter to comply with 40 CFR part 2 so that all materials claimed as confidential
may be properly protected. This includes, but is not limited to, clearly indicating on the face of the comment (as well
as on any associated correspondence) that information claimed to be CBI is included, or marking ``CONFIDENTIAL,''
``TSCA CBI,'' or a similar designation on the face of each document or attachment in the comment which contains the
claimed CBI. EPA considers the failure to clearly identify the claimed confidential status on the face of the comment
or attachment as a waiver of any such claim and will make such information available to the public without further notice
to the commentor.

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Under Executive Order 12866 (58 FR 51735, October 4, 1993), the Agency must determine whether the regulatory action
is ``significant'' and therefore subject to review by the Office of Management and Budget (OMB) and the requirements
of the Executive Order. Under section 3(f), the Order defines a ``significant regulatory action'' as an action that
is likely to (1) have an annual effect on the economy of $100 million or more, or adversely and materially affecting
a sector of the economy, productivity, competition, jobs, the environment, public health or safety, or State, local,
or tribal governments or communities (also referred to as ``economically significant''); (2) create serious inconsistency
or otherwise interfering with an action taken or planned by another agency; (3) materially alter the budgetary impacts
of entitlements, grants, user fees, or loan programs or the rights and obligations of recipients thereof; or (4) raise
novel legal or policy issues arising out of legal mandates, the President's priorities, or the principles set forth
in this Executive Order. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Pursuant to the terms of this Executive Order, OMB determined that this rule was ``significant'' because of the substantial
cost savings estimated in association with the changes proposed. As such, this rule was submitted to OMB for review
and any changes made in response to OMB comments are available for review in the docket.

Section 603 of the Regulatory Flexibility Act (15 U.S.C. 8091 et seq. Pub. L. 96&hyph;534. September 19, 1980), requires
EPA to prepare and make available for comment a regulatory flexibility analysis in connection with rulemaking. The
initial regulatory flexibility analysis must describe the impact of the proposed rule on small business entities.
If, however, a regulation will not have a significant impact on a substantial number of small entities, no such regulatory
impact analysis is required. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The proposed amendments to the PCB regulations will generate a variety of regulatory and deregulatory impacts on
the diverse entities and industries affected by PCB handling and disposal requirements. This section examines the
compliance costs and cost savings the regulated community will experience as a result of the proposed amendments.
It also assesses how the PCB amendments will affect a variety of small businesses that handle and dispose of PCB Items
and PCB wastes.

 This section describes compliance costs and cost savings estimated for each of the proposed revisions to the PCB regulations.
The cost estimates use various economic data inputs. In several cases, wage rate estimates were used for estimating
the labor costs or cost savings from regulatory changes. The wage rates are derived from an EPA study and represent
standard wage rate estimates used in OPPT studies. The hourly wage rates used are:

Treatment of costs for provisions that codify EPA policy.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 In several instances, an EPA policy has been developed in response to new information received by EPA or concerns about
compliance problems, and the proposed rule would codify these policies. Because the existing regulations differ
from EPA's policies, two sets of cost estimates were prepared based on two different baselines. The strict language
of the existing regulations served as the first baseline, which was used to generate cost estimates for all sections
of the proposed regulations. Actual EPA policy or practice was used as the baseline for 29 provisions of the amendments.
In cases where the current EPA policy and the existing regulations do not differ, a single cost estimate was prepared
and applied in either case.

 All cost estimates were prepared assuming full compliance with the existing and the proposed regulations, although
in reality, many companies are not in full compliance with the existing regulations. This study is designed only to
estimate the costs of the proposed regulations; the actions necessary to achieve compliance with the existing regulations
are not considered.

Treatment of the effect of the proposed amendments on disposal capacity and disposal prices.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 The analysis does not reflect possible effects of the proposed amendments on either disposal capacity or disposal
costs for PCB wastes. The proposed amendments include several elements that could reduce demand for disposal of PCB
wastes in chemical landfills, such as allowing for longer storage of some wastes and for use of alternative disposal
technologies. It is reasonable to anticipate that the availability of alternatives to TSCA permitted landfills
and incinerators will lower costs for disposal at those facilities. Nevertheless, these market changes were not
modeled in this study.

Consideration of future declines in the volume of PCB waste requiring disposal.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 In future years the amount of PCB waste will decline. Discussions with various industry representatives, however,
indicated that this waste stream still would be substantial for a number of years. Disposal of PCB-Contaminated soils
from remediation sites, one of the major categories of wastes addressed in the proposed regulations, is likely to
continue for several decades.

 Given that the time horizon for waste disposal remains so long, a declining time horizon for compliance costs or cost
savings was not taken into account for this study.

The estimated time horion for disposal of PCB wastes from remediation sites is based on estimates of the time needed
for remediating hazardous waste sites in the Superfund program. EPA estimated that at the current rate of cleanup,
remediation of the sites on the National Priority List will take 48 more years (U.S. EPA, 1993).

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Cost annualization.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 In several cases, the compliance costs or cost savings would be incurred solely in the first year after regulatory
implementation. Examples of such regulations include one-time requirements for the registration of transformers.
Since most new elements create recurring annual costs or cost savings, consistency required that the one-time elements
be annualized. The one-time items were annualized over 5 years at 3 percent per year (annualization factor of 0.2184).
The 5&hyph;year time horizon was chosen as most appropriate for the administrative and recordkeeping tasks most
numerous among the first-year requirements; a longer annualization schedule would have suggested long-term investments,
such as in durable assets and equipment; a shorter term annualization schedule would suggest regulatory requirements
that need to be renewed.

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Aggregate net cost estimates
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
. Table 4&hyph;1 of the Regulatory Impact Analysis developed for this rulemaking presents the aggregate net cost
savings for the PCB regulations under the two baselines. The net cost impact of the proposed amendments, using either
current EPA policy or the EPA regulation as the baseline, is a cost savings of over $4 billion per year. This figure was
based on cost savings of $4.2 billion to $4.8 billion per year under the alternative baselines, and compliance costs
of $11.6 million. As noted in the previous section, these cost savings would likely extend indefinitely into the future.
The difference between the two baselines occurs because current EPA policy took into account exceptional compliance
difficulties that arose when previously unknown sources of PCB contamination were discovered. A strict interpretation
of the existing PCB regulations in these areas would have generated large compliance costs for various users of PCBs.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The specific areas of additional compliance costs (i.e., incremental to baseline conditions) and cost savings are
discussed below.

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
 Areas of additional cost
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
. The total incremental costs for new compliance requirements in the proposed regulations were estimated to be $11.6
million. This estimate does not include certain cost items that are included in paragraphs that show a net cost savings.
The effect of these additional items on the total compliance costs, however, is quite modest. The compliance cost
estimate is the same for either baseline since the existing regulatory environment does not influence the cost of
new requirements. Table 4&hyph;2 of the Regulatory Impact Analysis developed for this rulemaking lists the sections
of the proposed regulation that will lead to additional costs. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Six provisions of the proposed regulations describe new recordkeeping or reporting requirements for facilities
with PCB equipment or wastes. The two most costly of these requirements are under 761.180(a)(1)(iii) and (iv), which
require recordkeeping and the preparation of an inventory of PCB equipment. These two sections would generate estimated
annual compliance costs of $3,771,180. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Another major cost increment would be generated by 761.60(b)(6)(ii), the disposal of drained PCB Articles. While
the existing policy did not regulate the disposal of these articles, the proposed regulations specify acceptable
disposal means. The total additional costs are estimated to be $3.5 million, generated primarily by greater costs
for disposing of PCB-Contaminated Transformers. Most transformers now are disposed of via industrial furnace,
but certain of these facilities would not meet the furnace standards specified in proposed 761.60(a)(4), and the
furnaces no longer would be able to accept this equipment. It is likely that most of these PCB Articles would be incinerated
or placed in chemical waste landfills. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Costs of $1.3 million and $1.1 million per year were estimated for 761.40(k) and 761.30(a)(1)(vii), which cover the
marking of PCB Large Low-Voltage Capacitors and Transformers and the registration with EPA of PCB Transformers in
use, respectively. Many facilities are estimated to require 4 hours or more to locate, mark, and register these items.
Similarly, the transformer registration requirement would require electric utilities and a variety of industrial
facilities to submit information on their PCB Transformers. While this amendment requires only the submission of
information that the firms should have readily available, a large number of facilities would incur some expense to
register their PCB Transformers. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Other proposed provisions estimated to generate incremental cost include:

of equipment. Incremental costs are estimated to be $0.9 million per year.

 Section 761.60(b)(4) specifies the amount of time PCB-Contaminated Electrical Equipment must be drained and adds
language to indicate appropriate options for the disposal of drained equipment. The added costs are estimated to
be $131,400 per year.

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
 Areas of cost savings.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 Cost savings of $4.2 billion to $4.8 billion per year are estimated using either existing EPA policy or the existing
regulations as the baseline. The areas of estimated cost savings are summarized in Table 4&hyph;3 of the Regulatory
Impact Analysis developed for this rulemaking. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The provision expected to result in the largest cost savings (estimated at slightly over $4.0 billion per year) is
proposed 761.61, which covers the disposal of remediation wastes when the existing EPA regulations are used as the
baseline. This section allows an expanded set of disposal options and simplified administrative procedures, where
the existing regulation allowed only chemical waste landfilling and incineration. There is, however, uncertainty
about the estimate of the remediation rate (i.e., the amount of waste that is remediated annually); the variation
in the plausible values of this estimate produces a range for the annual cost savings of $2 billion to $6 billion. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The disposal of non-remediation waste, covered in proposed 761.62, is estimated to generate another large annual
cost savings ($150 million per year) compared to either the existing regulations or EPA policy. The proposed rule
establishes disposal options other than chemical waste landfills or incineration for non-remediation wastes containing
PCBs in concentrations

Additional substantial cost savings of the PCB amendments were estimated at $500 million per year for proposed 761.30(q),
the Continued Use of Pre-TSCA PCBs. The proposed section provides that PCB Items (such as HVAC gaskets, plastic, plasticizers,
electric cable, and others) would be authorized for use for the remainder of their useful life, whereas the existing
regulations banned the use of these items. The large estimated savings for this section are based on the estimates
of the number of buildings with PCB contamination for which continued use is allowed under the regulatory amendments.
The number of these locations is not known, however, and thus cost savings can only be roughly approximated. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Another provision that would result in cost savings is proposed 761.60(b)(5), which covers the abandonment and disposal
of PCB-Contaminated natural gas pipelines. An annual cost savings of close to $63 million is generated because the
proposed regulations would allow considerably greater latitude in dealing with this waste stream than did the existing
regulations. Under the existing regulations, all PCB-Contaminated natural gas pipelines that are inaccessible
for characterization or that contain PCBs in concentrations >500 ppm require excavation and either incineration
or disposal in chemical waste landfills. Based on existing EPA policies, which are similar to the proposed regulations,
the annual cost savings is much smaller_$387,310. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Another area of cost savings is estimated for proposed 761.60(b)(6)(iii), which identifies disposal options for
nonporous surfaces, including metal ship and submarine hulls and air handling systems contaminated by PCBs at concentrations

or EPA policy as the baseline.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
A cost savings of $10.6 million per year was estimated for 761.77, Coordinated Approval, using either the existing
regulations or EPA policy as the baseline. These proposed regulations would acknowledge permits for PCB facilities
(i.e, for land disposal, incineration, research and development, alternative disposal technologies, commercial
storage, or site remediation) issued under other State and Federal environmental programs, including RCRA, and
where states classify PCBs as hazardous wastes or regulate PCBs in a similar fashion to the TSCA regulations.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
50 ppm, provided that a Spill Prevention Plan has been prepared. Existing measures allow temporary storage only when

 Regulatory impact on small businesses.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 The PCB amendments would affect a variety of small businesses that handle and dispose of PCB Items and PCB wastes. This
section considers the economic impacts on those businesses and addresses the analytical requirements of the Regulatory
Flexibility Act (RFA). The RFA requires agencies to explore options for minimizing small business impacts whenever
there is a ``significant economic impact on a substantial number of small entities.'' While this discussion will
consider the significance of the potential impacts, EPA's internal policy is to consider any impacts on any small
entities (U.S. EPA, 1992d). 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
According to EPA's guidelines, significant impacts are produced if:

 Economic impacts on small industrial furnace operations.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The small industrial furnace operators handling PCB-Contaminated transformers would experience negative economic
impacts as a result of the proposed amendments. It was estimated that approximately 100 industrial furnace operations
specialize in recovery of transformer carcasses. Most of the businesses are small, ranging from owner-operated
units with fewer than 10 employees, to larger operations approaching 100 employees. The major asset for these facilities
is their furnace which, in the case of Aljon-United furnaces, carries a capital cost of over $100,000. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Through contacts with a selection of operators, their likely response to the PCB amendments was estimated. In general,
firms would not be likely to invest in the new furnace equipment that would meet EPA specifications. The new equipment
is quite costly and the high temperatures required would make recovery of the metals impossible. It was estimated
that, on average, these operations derive approximately 15 percent of their inputs from PCB-Contaminated transformers,
based on several contacts with industry personnel. The remainder of their inputs are non-PCB-Contaminated transformers
and other electrical equipment. There are no financial statistics available through conventional or other sources
of industry data that can provide an overview of the condition of the metal recovery furnace industry. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Given these characteristics of the affected industrial furnace operations, the EPA criteria to determine whether
the economic impacts are significant were applied. None of the first three criteria shown could be evaluated, however,
because they all are defined by the size of the compliance costs incurred. The industrial furnace operators would
not incur direct compliance costs, choosing instead to cease handling of the PCB-Contaminated transformers. The
last criterion asks whether the small firms will cease operations. Based on discussions with industry firms, it was
estimated that few operations would shut down. As noted, the affected PCB transformers represent approximately
15 percent of the inputs for metal recovery operations. A corresponding 15 percent decline in profits, while representing
a hardship, should not cause many plant shutdowns. Most likely there would not be many firms whose inputs, owing to
a peculiarity in their sources of supply, contain a much higher portion of PCB-Contaminated transformers than other
firms. Nevertheless, some firms might experience sharper profit declines. Also, firms that are currently in poor
financial condition could be weakened further as a result of the amendments and might, therefore, now face closure.
The extent or likelihood of such closures cannot be estimated, however.

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
 Economic impacts on small demolition contractors
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
. Section 761.60(b)(2)(ii) prohibits disposal of more than 24 light ballasts as municipal solid wastes. Most waste
light ballasts are generated during building demolition operations. Many demolition contractors that handle the
disposal of light ballasts, and their customers, would incur increased disposal costs due to these regulations.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
At present, most PCB light ballasts are disposed of as municipal solid waste. Demolition contractors, however, would
be required to assemble and transport PCB-containing light ballasts for transportation to and disposal at a PCB disposal
facility. The aggregate economic impact was estimated for this provision of the regulations at $54 million for disposal
of approximately 30 million PCB-containing light ballasts. This translates to an average incremental cost of approximately
$1.80 per PCB-containing light ballast, covering transportation and disposal, as derived in the specific cost estimates
for this provision. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The size of the incremental cost incurred on a specific demolition job would vary directly with the size of the job.
Thus, relatively small demolition jobs (those generating only slightly more than 24 PCB-containing light ballasts,
for example, those with 25 to 50 ballasts) would incur incremental disposal costs of $45 to $90 (25 to 50 times $1.80).
In contrast, large demolition jobs, with thousands of light ballasts would incur additional disposal costs of several
thousands of dollars. Thus, the incremental costs are distributed among demolition jobs according to their size,
and the incremental costs would not be likely to be a large percentage increase in the cost of demolition jobs. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Demolition contractors do not vary much in their ability to handle and dispose of PCB-containing light ballasts,
so there would not be much variation in the unit costs of compliance among firms. For example, virtually all demolition
firms would use commercial waste facilities to dispose of light ballasts. This consistency of impacts among firms
suggests that firms would not be able to compete on their ability to dispose of PCB wastes, and therefore, would all
face similar cost increases. In competitive markets, where all firms face similar cost increases, the price of services
should increase to cover the increase in costs. Thus, demolition contractors would be likely to pass the incremental
disposal costs to their customers, new building or land development companies, and therefore, would be able to mitigate
even minor cost impacts. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The EPA criteria on small business impacts were applied to the case of demolition contractors. None of the four criteria
are satisfied, however, by the regulatory impacts. Compliance costs are estimated to be less than 5 percent of the
costs of production and less than 10 percent of the cost of sales in all but very exceptional circumstances. Essentially
no capital cost expenditures would be required of the affected firms. Finally, few operations, if any, would likely
fail due to these regulatory impacts.

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
 Economic impacts on other small businesses
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
. Small businesses in other industries also would be affected by the PCB amendments. These costs were estimated, however,
to be widely distributed among small firms, and generally would be distributed in proportion to the level of PCB disposal
activities. Also, the aggregate costs of these remaining items is not very large, and therefore, no significant impacts
on small businesses are forecast. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Among the businesses potentially affected are a small number of companies that currently have special EPA approvals
to decontaminate various types of PCB-Contaminated equipment, including PCB Transformers, components of natural
gas pipelines, and others. For these businesses, the proposed amendments might generate additional competition
because many more companies would be able to decontaminate equipment without needing to obtain special EPA approval.
It was judged, however, that impacts are likely to be modest among such firms. The companies in question are either
confident that their clients would not be interested in decontaminating their own equipment (due either to the capital
investments required or the relative ease of using outside contractor personnel for these functions) or the PCB-decontamination
business represented a modest portion of their current operations.

The Paperwork Reduction Act of 1980. 44 U.S.C. 3501 et seq. authorizes the Director of the Office of Management and
Budget (OMB) to review certain information collection requests by Federal Agencies. EPA has determined that the
recordkeeping and reporting requirements of this rule constitute a ``collection of information'' as defined at
44 U.S.C. 3502(4). 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The information collection requirements of this proposed rule have been submitted for approval to the OMB under the
Paperwork Reduction Act, 44 U.S.C. 3501 et seq. An Information Collection Request document has been prepared by EPA
(ICR No. 1729), and a copy may be obtained from the Information Policy Branch (2136), Environmental Protection Agency,
401 M St., SW., Washington, DC 20460. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The public burden for this collection of information is estimated to average anywhere from 140 hours to 1,977 hours
per respondent depending on the PCB activities in which the respondent is engaged. These estimates include time for
reviewing instructions, searching existing data sources, gathering and maintaining the needed data, and completing
and reviewing the collection of information. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Comments regarding the burden estimate or any other aspect of this collection of information, including suggestions
for reducing this burden, should be submitted to the Chief, Information Policy Branch (2136), Environmental Protection
Agency, 401 M St., SW., Washington, DC 20460. These comments should also be submitted to the Office of Information
and Regulatory Affairs, Office of Management and Budget, Washington, DC 20503, marked ATTENTION: Desk Officer for
EPA. The final rule will respond to any OMB or public comments on the information collection requirements contained
in this proposal.

Items. Substances that are regulated by this part include, but are not limited to: dielectric fluids; contaminated
solvents; oils; waste oils; heat transfer fluids; hydraulic fluids; paints; sludges; slurries; sediments; dredge
spoils; soils; materials contaminated as a result of spills; and other chemical substances or combinations of substances,
including impurities and byproducts and any byproduct, intermediate, or impurity manufactured at any point in a
process. Unless otherwise noted, references to volumes or weights in this part apply to total volume or weight of the
material containing or contacting PCBs. Most of the provisions of this part apply to PCBs only if PCBs are present in
concentrations above a specified level. For example, subpart D of this part applies generally to materials at concentrations
of 50 parts per million (ppm) and above. Also, certain provisions of subpart B of this part apply to PCBs inadvertently
generated in manufacturing processes at concentrations specified in the definition of ``PCB'' under  761.3. PCB
concentrations for non-liquid PCBs under this part shall be determined on a dry weight basis according to the definition
at 761.3. For liquid PCBs as defined in 761.3, PCB concentrations shall be determined on a wet weight basis. For samples
containing PCBs and equal to or greater than 0.5 percent non-dissolved non-liquid materials, the non-dissolved
materials shall be separated and the PCB concentration determined for non-liquid PCBs; the rest of the sample shall
be considered to be liquid PCBs. For multiphasic non-liquid/liquid or liquid/liquid mixtures, the phases shall
be separated before chemical analysis. Following phase separation, the PCB concentration in each non-liquid phase
shall be determined on a dry weight basis and the PCB concentration in each liquid phase shall be determined separately
on a wet weight basis. No provision specifying a PCB concentration may be avoided as a result of any dilution, unless
otherwise specifically provided.

(100 cubic inches) may be considered to contain less than 1.36 kgs (3 lbs.) of dielectric fluid and a capacitor whose
total volume is more than 3,278 cubic centimeters (200 cubic inches) must be considered to contain more than 1.36 kg
(3 lbs.) of dielectric fluid. A capacitor whose volume is between 1,639 and 3,278 cubic centimeters may be considered
to contain less than 1.36 kg (3 lbs.) of dielectric fluid if the total weight of the capacitor is less than 4.08 kg (9 lbs.).

Commercial storer of PCB waste
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 means the owner or operator of each facility that is subject to the PCB storage unit standards of 761.65 and who engages
in storage activities involving PCB waste generated by others, or PCB waste that was removed while servicing the equipment
owned by others and brokered for disposal. The receipt of a fee or any other form of compensation for storage services
is not necessary to qualify as a commercial storer of PCB waste. It is sufficient under this definition that the facility
stores PCB waste generated by others or the facility removed the PCB waste while servicing equipment owned by others.
If a facility's storage of PCB waste at no time exceeds 500 gallons of liquid or 70 cubic feet of non-liquid PCBs, the
owner or operator is a commercial storer but is not required to seek EPA approval as a commercial storer of PCB waste.
Change in ownership or title of a generator's facility, where the generator is storing PCB waste, does not make the
new owner of the facility a commercial storer of PCB waste.

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
PCBs disposed of, placed in a land disposal facility, spilled, or otherwise released into the environment prior to
April 18, 1978, will be presumed to be disposed of in a manner that does not present a risk of exposure and, therefore,
does not require further disposal action unless a Regional Administrator makes a finding that such a disposal prior
to April 18, 1978 presents a risk of exposure from PCBs. The Regional Administrator may then require the submission
of an application for a risk-based disposal approval under 761.61 or 761.62. Liquid PCBs shall not be processed into
non-liquid forms to circumvent the high temperature incineration requirements of paragraph (a) of this section.
Open burning of PCBs is prohibited. Combustion of PCBs approved under 761.60(a) or (e), or otherwise allowed under
part 761 is not open burning. When storage is desired prior to disposal, PCBs at concentrations of 50 ppm or greater
shall be stored in a facility which complies with 761.65. Except as authorized in 761.30 or prohibited in 761.20, PCB
waste must be disposed of in accordance with the provisions of this subpart. Any person disposing of PCBs is also responsible
for determining and complying with all other applicable Federal, State, or local laws or regulations.

(ii) In lieu of the requirement in paragraph (a)(4)(i)(H) of this section, upon written request by the owner or operator
of an industrial furnace, the EPA Regional Administrator, for the Region where the furnace is located, may make a finding
in writing, based on a site-specific risk assessment, that the industrial furnace does not pose an unreasonable risk
of injury to health or the environment because it is operating in compliance with the parameters and conditions listed
in paragraphs (a)(4)(i)(A), (B), (C), (D), (E), (F), and (G) of this section even though that industrial furnace does
not have a RCRA or State air permit as required by this section. The written request shall include a site-specific risk
assessment.

 For purposes of cleaning or decontaminating PCB remediation waste under this section there are two general categories
of waste: bulk PCB remediation waste (everything other than non-porous surfaces, such as: soil, sediments, dredged
materials, debris, muds, municipal sludge, industrial sludge, and porous surfaces) and non-porous surfaces. Sampling
for the verification of the cleanup of the PCB remediation wastes shall be in accordance with Appendix II of this part.
Interim sampling during on-going cleanup may use PCB screening tests to determine when to take samples to verify that
cleanup is complete. Requirements for the use of the PCB screening tests for this interim sampling are the same as for
site characterization in paragraphs (a)(2)(ii)(B) of this section.

 Any persons storing PCB waste that is subject to the 1&hyph;year time limit for storage and disposal in paragraph (a)(1)
of this section may provide written notification to the Regional Administrator for the Region in which the PCB waste
is stored that they have been unsuccessful in their continuing attempts to dispose of or secure disposal for their
waste within the 1&hyph;year time limit. Upon receipt of the notice by the Regional Administrator, the time for disposal
is automatically extended by action of this section for 1 additional year (2 years total) if the following conditions
are met: 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(i) The notification is received by the Regional Administrator at least 30 days before the expiration of the initial
1&hyph;year time limit and it identifies the storer, the types, volumes, and location of the waste and the reasons
for failure to meet the initial 1&hyph;year time limit. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(ii) A written record documenting all continuing attempts to secure disposal is maintained until the waste is disposed

additional extensions beyond the One-year extension authorized in paragraph (a)(2) of this section. At the time
of the request, the requestor must supply specific justification for the additional extension and indicate what
measures the requestor is taking to secure disposal of the waste or indicate why disposal could not be conducted during
the period of the prior extension. The Regional Administrator may require, as condition to granting any extension
under this section, specific actions including, but not limited to, marking, inspection, recordkeeping, or financial
assurance to ensure that the waste does not pose an unreasonable risk of injury to health or the environment.

by the Regional Administrator for the Region in which the PCBs or PCB Items are to be stored or the Director, Chemical
Management Division (CMD), as appropriate, if the Regional Administrator or Director, CMD determines that there
is a demonstrated need or justification for such extension and that no unreasonable risk of injury to health or the
environment will result. Criteria for extending the 1&hyph;year time limit for storage and disposal include, but
are not limited to, lack of disposal capacity, the absence of a treatment technology, or insufficient time to complete
the treatment/destruction process and a demonstration that relevant treatment or disposal options are being pursued.
In granting such extensions, the Regional Administrator or the Director, CMD may require the submission of any information
the Regional Administrator or the Director, CMD believes is necessary for an evaluation of the requested extension
and periodic progress reports that demonstrate that appropriate treatment or disposal options are being pursued.

 Notwithstanding any other provision of this part, the EPA Regional Administrator for the Region in which a PCB disposal
or PCB commercial storage facility described in paragraphs (b) through (g) of this section is located may issue a TSCA
PCB Coordinated Approval to the persons described in those paragraphs if the conditions listed in this section are
met. A TSCA PCB Coordinated Approval will designate the persons who own and who are authorized to operate the facilities
described in paragraphs (b) through (g) of this section and will apply only to such persons. All requirements, conditions,
and limitations of any other permit or waste management document described in those paragraphs are deemed to be conditions
of the TSCA PCB Coordinated Approval whose violation is a prohibited act under section 15 of TSCA. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(1) Persons seeking a TSCA PCB Coordinated Approval shall submit a request for approval by certified mail, return
receipt requested, to the Regional Administrator for the Region in which the activity will take place. Persons seeking
a TSCA PCB Coordinated Approval for a new PCB activity shall submit the request for approval at the same time they seek
a permit, approval, or other action for a PCB waste management activity under any other Federal or State authority.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(i) The request for approval shall include a copy of the letter from EPA announcing or confirming the EPA ID Number issued
to the facility for conducting PCB activities; the name, organization, and telephone number of the individual who
is the point of contact for the non-TSCA Federal, State, or local permitting authority; a description of the waste
management activities to be conducted if a permit or other relevent waste management document has not been issued;
a copy of the relevant permit or waste management document specified in paragraphs (b) through (g) of this section;
and a certification that the person who owns or operates the facility is aware of and will adhere to the TSCA PCB reporting
and recordkeeping requirements at subparts J and K of this part. When a permit or other waste management document has
been issued for the PCB waste activity, a final copy of the non-TSCA document that will be used during the PCB activity,
including all requirements, conditions, and limitations, shall be submitted to the Regional Administrator. This
requirement may be waived, in writing, by the Regional Administrator. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(ii) The Regional Administrator shall confirm receipt of the request for approval. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(iii) The Regional Administrator shall review the request for approval for completeness, for compliance with the
requirements of paragraphs (b) through (g), and to ensure that the PCB activity for which approval is requested will
not present an unreasonable risk of injury to health or the environment. The Regional Administrator shall either:

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(A) Issue a written notice of deficiency explaining why the request for approval is deficient. In addition, the Regional
Administrator shall either:

for a TSCA PCB approval; 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(B) Issue a notice of TSCA PCB Coordinated Approval acknowledging the non-TSCA approval meets the regulatory requirements
under TSCA as written; or 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(C) Issue a notice of TSCA PCB Coordinated Approval that includes additional conditions that are necessary to implement
other sections of part 761 or that address the Regional Administrator's concerns associated with potential risks
of injury to health or the environment. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(2) If the Regional Administrator determines that conditions of the approval are not met, the Regional Administrator
may issue a notice of deficiency, revoke the TSCA PCB Coordinated Approval, or require the person to whom the TSCA PCB
Coordinated Approval was issued to submit an application for a TSCA PCB approval. Such a determination could be based
on, but would not necessarily limited to the following: 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(i) Compliance with paragraphs (b) through (g) of this section. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

(a) The purpose of this section is to establish for this part, regulatory levels and self-implementing or standardized
decontamination levels and procedures for removing PCBs from equipment, structures, non-porous surfaces, liquids
or other materials to allow for reuse. Any person conducting a decontamination activity under this section becomes
a new generator of a PCB waste. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(1) For purposes of decontamination under this section, the solubility of PCBs in any solvent used must be 5 percent
or more by weight. The solvent may be reused for decontamination until it contains 50 ppm PCBs. All hydrocarbon solvent

(3) A written record must be established and maintained for a period of 3 years from the date of any decontamination
under this section. The record must show sampling locations and analytical results and must be retained at the site
of the decontamination or a copy of the record must be made available to EPA in a timely manner, if requested. This recordkeeping
requirement does not apply when sampling is not required under this section. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(4) For purposes of decontamination under this section, filtering, soaking, wiping, stripping of insulation, chopping,
scraping or the use of abrasives to remove or separate PCBs from contaminated surfaces or liquids does not require
a disposal approval under subpart D of this part. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(5) Any person conducting decontamination activities under this section shall take measures to ensure that no solvent,
dust or particulate emissions containing PCBs are released to the environment from the decontamination area. Workers

(j) The requirements of this section apply only to PCB wastes as defined in  761.3. This includes PCB wastes with PCB
concentrations below 50 ppm where the PCB concentration below 50 ppm was the result of dilution; these PCB wastes are
required under  761.1(b) to be managed as if they contained PCB concentrations of 50 ppm and above. An example of such
a PCB waste is spill cleanup material containing less than 50 ppm PCBs when the spill involved material containing
PCBs at a concentration of 50 ppm or greater. However, there is no manifest requirement for material currently below
50 ppm which derives from pre-April 18, 1978, spills of any concentration, pre-July 2, 1979, spills of less than 500
ppm PCBs, or materials decontaminated in accordance 761.20(c)(5) of this part.

Sample Site Selection
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->
 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
3.1 There are three site selection parameters: position around the circumference of a selected pipe segment or pipe,
position along the length of a selected pipe segment or pipe, and selection of a pipe segment from a length of pipe or
population (group) of pipe segments. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
3.2 Position around the circumference of a pipe segment or pipe. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
3.2.1 When pipe or a pipe segment is accessed for sampling, the pipe shall be marked to identify the location of the bottom
of the pipe or pipe segment when the natural gas pipeline was in service. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
3.2.2 The inside center of the bottom of a pipe or pipe segment shall be sampled. The sample shall be centered on the bottom
of the pipe, that is, the sample shall encompass an equal area on both sides of the middle of the bottom of the pipe for
the entire length of the sample. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
3.3 Position along the length of the pipe or pipe segment 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
3.3.1 The sample shall be taken 15 centimeters (6 inches) inside the end of a pipe or pipe segment at the bottom of the
pipe or pipe segment as determined in procedure 3.2 of this appendix. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
3.3.2 If the sample site location selected in procedure 3.3.1 of this appendix is a porous surface (for example, there
is significant corrosion so as to shred the wipe material), then the sample site shall be moved inward (away from the
end of the pipe or pipe segment) until there is no such porous surface. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
3.3.3 There are three options in the event that there is no non-porous surface accessible by procedure 3.3.1 or 3.3.2
of this appendix. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
3.3.3.1 The sample for that pipe or pipe segment shall only be taken at one end and a written notation documented in the
sampling and analysis records as to why only one sample was taken. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
3.3.3.2 Select another pipe segment using the random selection procedure in 3.4.2 of this appendix, or 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
3.3.3.3 In the event that there is no other pipe or pipeline in the population to be sampled and both ends of a pipe have
porous surfaces at all possible sample collection sites, then the pipe segment or pipe shall be assumed to contain
greater than 50 but less than 500 ppm PCBs. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
3.4 Selection of a pipe segment from a length of pipe or population (group) of pipe segments. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
3.4.1 For purposes of wipe sampling pipe segments, the segments shall not exceed 12.1 meters (40 feet) in length. In
the event that a segment is longer than 12.1 meters in length, the segment shall be cut so that all resulting segments
are 12.1 meters or less in length. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
3.4.2 Pipe segments removed from the ground for disposal shall be sampled at each end. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
3.4.2.1 When a length of pipe having seven or fewer segments is removed for purposes of disposal, samples shall be taken
at each end of each segment removed. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
3.4.2.2 When a length of pipe having multiple contiguous segments less than 3 miles in total length is removed for purposes
of disposal, samples shall be taken at each end of the first and last segments removed and each end of five randomly chosen
segments in between. A total of seven segments shall be sampled. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
3.4.2.3 When a length of pipe having multiple contiguous segments more than 3 miles in total length is removed for purposes
of disposal, samples shall be taken at each end of the first segment and each end of each segment that is one-half mile
distant from the segment previously sampled. A minimum of seven segments shall be sampled. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
3.4.3 Sampling of Pipe to Be Abandoned in Place 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
3.4.3.1 Procedures in 761.60(b)(5)(iii)(B) shall be followed first to assure the absence of free flowing liquids.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
3.4.3.2 Both ends of all pipe to be abandoned in place are to be sampled, samples shall be taken at each end of each pipe.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
3.4.3.3 For abandonment of pipe exceeding 50 miles but less than 100 miles in length, an additional sample at the midpoint
shall be taken. Sampling the midpoint sample may be taken by removing all covering soil and cutting the pipe to gain
access to the sampling location in lieu of removing a segment of pipe. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
3.4.3.4 For abandonment of pipe exceeding 100 miles in length, both ends and a point every 50 miles from the downstream
(of the direction of the former gas flow) shall be sampled. Internal samples may be collected by removing any covering
soil and cutting the pipe to gain access to the sampling location in lieu of removing segments of pipe.

shall be taken. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
2.1 For each type of PCB remediation waste present at the remediation site and at each separate site within a facility,
a minimum of three samples shall be taken. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
2.2 For each sample, the PCB concentration shall be measured, recorded and kept on file.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
There are three distinct, sites at the location: a loading dock, a transformer storage lot, and a disposal pit. The
minimum number of samples appears after each type of waste for each site. The PCB remediation wastes present at the
loading dock are concrete (3), and clay soil (3). The PCB remediation wastes present at the transformer storage lot
are oily soil (3), clay soil (3), and gravel (3). The PCB remediation wastes present at the disposal pit are sandy soil
(3), clay soil (3), oily soil (3), industrial sludge (3), sludge aqueous decantate (3) and gravel (3). For purposes
of the self-implementing cleanup and disposal of these PCB remediation wastes, the minimum total number of samples
needed to verify cleanup at this entire site as described is procedure 3.0 of this appendix.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
4.3.3 The grid system is to be oriented so that its origin is nearest to the lower left corner of the area to be sampled.
When this Cartesian system is oriented this way, the entire area falls into the first (upper right or positive on both
axes) quadrant of the grid.

5.2 Sampling of Bulk PCB Remediation Wastes 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
5.2.1 At each sampling grid point, core samples shall be collected from at least one and no more than four different
locations surrounding each grid point. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
5.2.2 Each core sample around the grid point shall be no closer than 10 centimeters (4 inches) and no farther than forty
centimeters (16 inches) from the grid point. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
5.2.2.1 If more than one core sample is taken at a grid point, all of these samples shall be composited (see procedure

5.2.2.2.2 Each core sample shall be taken to a depth of 2.5 centimeters below the surface

the average particle in the material. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
5.2.2.3.2 The depth of the core sample shall be two and a half times the estimated average diameter of the particles

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
6.2 All chemical analyses for PCBs in composite samples shall be by means of a gas chromatography with electron capture
detector (GC/EC) method such as EPA SW&hyph;846 Method 8080. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
6.3 Compositing bulk PCB remediation waste samples from more than one grid point. Bulk PCB remediation waste samples
from one grid may be composited so long as the PCB concentration of interest (the clean/not clean level) is divided
by the number of samples in the composite. The resulting quotient shall be called the ``composite action level.''
The composite action level eliminates the possibility that any one sample in the composite is above the PCB concentration
of interest. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
6.3.1 If the concentration from the analysis of the composite exceeds the ``composite action level,'' then it shall
be assumed that at least one sample in the composite exceeds the PCB concentration of interest. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
6.3.1.1 For example, for bulk PCB remediation waste samples, if the concentration of interest is 50 ppm and then ten
samples are composited and analyzed, then the ``composite action level'' is 5 ppm. If the chemical analysis results
indicates less than 5 ppm, there are no samples having a concentration greater than 50 ppm (the PCB concentration of
interest). If the chemical analysis is 5 ppm or greater then there may be at least one sample in the composite having
a concentration exceeding the concentration of interest and further sampling and or compositing is necessary to
demonstrate that no sample exceeds the concentration of interest. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
6.3.2 If the concentration from the analysis of the composite is less than the ``composite action level,'' then it
shall be assumed that none of the individual samples in the composite exceeds the PCB concentration of interest. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
6.4 Compositing wipe samples from non-porous samples from more than one grid point. When accounting for dilution
from compositing wipe samples, it is not necessary to use samples wiped from the same total surface area so long as the
``composite action level'' (see procedure 6.1 of this appendix) assumes the smallest surface area from any of the
wipe samples composited. This difference from bulk remediation waste sample compositing is the result of the PCB
amount reported being a weight rather than a concentration. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
6.4.1 For example, if the PCB concentration of interest is

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
8.1 If, for the sampled type of waste at a designated site, any grid point sample PCB concentration exceeds the concentration
of interest or the PCB concentration of a composite sample exceeds the composite action level, then the type of waste
at the site has not been successfully cleaned up and, for purposes of self-implementing disposal, further cleanup
is required. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
8.2 In the event that further cleanup is required in paragraph 8.0 of this appendix, all of the type of waste at a particular
site at a facility (or any portion of the site) may be recleaned. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
8.3 Following the recleaning, the procedure to verify the completeness of the cleanup shall be reinitiated (starting
at paragraph 4.0 of this appendix) to determine whether the requirements have been met. This ``reverification''
shall include that the verification sampling grid be reoriented and all of the type of waste at a particular site at
the facility shall be resampled as required in paragraph 4.0&hyph;7.0 above. Cleaning a portion of the site and sampling
only the portion which was recleaned does not comply with these self-implementing PCB remediation waste cleanup
requirements. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
For example, assume that random samples were collected to verify a site remediation under 761.61(a) and one of the
samples of seven taken in a grid sampling plot had a concentration above the PCB concentration of concern. The site
represented by the seven grid samples may be recleaned only in the area surrounding that one sample. However, following
recleaning, the entire site must be resampled using a new set of seven grid samples, collected from a reoriented grid,
to verify that the cleanup resulted in no PCBs in any of the seven grid samples above the PCB concentration of concern.
This sampling procedure does not allow only resampling the areas which were recleaned. Nor does this sampling procedure
allow using the arithmetic mean or any other statistical evaluation of the results from several samples to arrive
at an overall ``average'' site concentration.

4.1 Selection of the Piles from which Sub-Samples Will Be Collected 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
4.1.1 If the processed PCB non-remediation waste from a single source consists of more than one pile or container,
each pile or container shall be assigned an integer number and then seven random integer numbers shall be generated
to select piles (from which sub-samples shall be collected) from the population of all piles. It is possible that this
random selection procedure will result in selecting the same pile number more than once, even if seven or more piles
are present. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
4.1.2 If only one pile or container is present, all seven samples shall be taken from the same pile. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
4.2 Collecting Sub-Samples from Flattened Piles or Containers 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
If possible, spread the pile(s) out to a uniform thickness of approximately 1 foot (or 30 centimeters [cm]) into a rectangular
or a circular shape. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
4.2.1 For a circular shape flattened pile or cylindrical container: 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
4.2.1.1 Use the procedures in the PCB Spill Cleanup manual (a triangular/hexagonal grid system) to select the seven
surface points for each composite sample for each flattened pile or container. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
4.2.1.2 Measure the depth of the pile at each sampling point in inches or centimeters. Randomly select a number of inches
or centimeters down from the surface using a random number generator. Then collect a 50 gram sample at the selected
depth. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
4.2.1.3 Composite the seven 50 gram samples collected from the seven sampling locations into a single sample for analysis.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
4.2.2 For a rectangular shape flattened pile or boxshaped container there are two options a random coordinate option
(procedure 4.2.2.1 of this appendix) and a grid option (procedure 4.2.2.2 of this appendix): 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
4.2.2.1 Designate the length, width, and depth of the flattened pile or container as three axes of a three dimensional
Cartesian coordinate grid system. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
4.2.2.1.1 Measure the length of each axis (length, width, and depth) in centimeters (or inches). Using a random number
generator, select an eligible set of three coordinates in centimeters (or inches) for each of seven sub-samples to
be taken. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
4.2.2.1.2 Collect each sub-sample at the location selected and composite the sub-samples into a single sample for
analysis. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
4.2.2.2 Use the grid sampling procedure in the Field Manual which is part of the ``Sampling Guidance for Scrap Metal
Shredders.'' Briefly described, this procedure divides the length and width of a flattened pile into three equal
segments, intersection of the length segments with the width segments results in a 3 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=6 f=1 -->
&times;
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->
 3 grid or nine cells. The length and width shall be chosen to be perpendicular. Samples shall be collected at the center
of each cell on the surface. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
4.3 Collecting Sub-samples from Unflattened Piles 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
If the pile is too large to be spread on the site to a uniform thickness of 1 foot or 30 centimeters, or there are too many
piles to spread out in the working area, the following procedure can be used to sample the piles. This procedure assumes
that the shape of the piles is roughly conical; that is, having a circular base with PCB non-remediation waste stacked
up uniformly to a peak which is roughly a point centered above the center of the circular base. For each sub-sample,
three sample site coordinates will be selected. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
4.3.1 Setting Up the Sample Site Selection System 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
4.3.1.1 Use a rod, dowel, stake, or broom handle as a marker. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
4.3.1.1.1 Nail or otherwise fasten to the top of the marker a piece of string or cord of sufficient length and strength
to reach from the top of the marker to the farthest peripheral edge of the pile. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
4.3.1.1.2 Pound or push the marker into the top center (apex) of the pile downward toward the center of the base at least
30 centimeters or one foot until the marker is rigidly standing on its own, even when the cord is pulled tight to the bottom
of the pile. The marker shall protrude from the top of the pile sufficiently to allow easy movement around the pile with
the tightened string. A side view of a pile with a marker and string is illustrated below. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
4.3.2 Select the first coordinate as follows: 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
4.3.2.1 Use a random number to generate a number between 0 and 360. The number generated is the number of degrees from
magnetic north. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
4.3.2.2 In a pile containing a lot of ferrous metal, the ferrous metal may have sufficient magnetism to deflect the
compass needle. Confirm the magnetic north direction at a location distant from a pile of metal before assuming that
the compass is not effected by local magnetism. In the event that the compass needle is deflected by the material to
be sampled, this sampling procedure shall not be used and the material to be sampled shall then be flattened. Once the
material is flattened, the sampling procedures in procedure 4.2 of this Appendix shall be used. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
4.3.2.3 Use a magnetic compass to determine this direction on the pile as follows: 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
4.3.2.3.1 Pull the cord to the bottom of the pile. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
4.3.2.3.2 Orient the compass so that the needle is pointing to magnetic north (At this point it may be helpful to sketch
a picture of the top view of the pile oriented to magnetic north and draw a line from the center of the pile outward in the
direction of the selected coordinate. (This drawing can be used to locate the approximate coordinate in the next step
and may be used to document the sampling location.). 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
4.3.2.3.3 With the cord slightly slack, hold the cord and walk around the outside edge of the pile to be sampled until
the approximate coordinate is reached. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
4.3.2.3.4 Tighten the cord and place the compass directly under the tightened cord at the bottom edge of the pile. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
4.3.2.3.5 Move around the outside of the pile with the cord laying over the center of the compass and with the needle
pointing to magnetic north and stop when the cord lies over the selected coordinate direction on the compass. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
4.3.2.4 Mark this first coordinate by tying the cord to a peg or placing it under a heavy weight. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
4.3.2.5 An illustration of the orientation of a magnetic compass and the cord with respect to a pile appears below 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
4.3.3 Select the second coordinate as follows: 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
4.3.3.1 Once the first coordinate has been fixed, along the first coordinate (the cord), measure the distance in centimeters
(or inches) from the bottom edge of the pile to the point where the marker meets the top of the pile. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
4.3.3.2 Select a random number between 0 and the total number of centimeters (inches) measured in paragraph 4.3.3.1
of this appendix. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
4.3.3.3 Proceed up the cord, from the bottom of the pile to the top, the selected number of centimeters (inches). 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
4.3.3.4 Pound or push a marker rod, dowel or broom handle down into the pile until the marker is secure to mark the second
coordinate point. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
4.3.4 Select the third (final) coordinate as follows: 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
4.3.4.1 Measure or estimate the vertical distance in centimeters (or inches) from the surface of the pile at the second
coordinate marker to the bottom of the pile or ground level. This distance will be referred to as ``vertical distance.''

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
4.3.4.2 Select a random number between 0 and the total number of centimeters (inches) of vertical distance. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
4.3.4.3 Dig a hole straight down into the pile the selected number of centimeters (inches) from the surface of the pile.
The hole shall be of sufficient distance from the second coordinate marker so as to allow the marker to remain in place.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
4.3.4.4 Slowly dig over to expose the second coordinate marker and collect the sub-sample on any side of this marker
at the depth selected in paragraph 4.3.4.2 of this appendix. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
4.3.4.5 In the event that the measurement or estimate of the distance to the bottom of the pile or the ground level was
too large and the selected depth is below the bottom of the pile, reselect a random number as indicated in paragraph
4.3.4.2 of this appendix using the vertical distance determined by digging as indicated in paragraph 4.3.4.3 of this
appendix.

SUMMARY:
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
 Section 6(e) of the Toxic Substances Control Act (TSCA) bans the manufacture, processing, distribution in commerce,
and the use of PCBs unless the PCBs are totally enclosed. Section 6(e) gives EPA authority, however, to allow these
activities if the Administrator finds that they will not present an unreasonable risk of injury to health and the environment.
This proposed rule addresses 19 individual petitions under TSCA section 6(e)(3)(B) for exemptions from the prohibition
against the manufacture, processing, and distribution in commerce of polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs). In this
proposed rule EPA proposes to deny eight petitions and to grant seven petitions; four petitions were withdrawn by
the petitioners.

 Section 6(e) of the Toxic Substances Control Act (TSCA) bans the manufacture, processing, distribution in commerce,
and the use of PCBs unless the PCBs are totally enclosed. Section 6(e) gives EPA authority, however, to authorize these
PCB activities if the Administrator finds that they will not present an unreasonable risk of injury to health or the
environment. TSCA provides that EPA may set terms and conditions, including recordkeeping and reporting requirements,
for granting an exemption.

A. Statutory Authority 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Section 6(e) of TSCA, 15 U.S.C. 2605(e), generally prohibits the manufacture of PCBs after January 1, 1979, the processing
and distribution in commerce of PCBs after July 1, 1979, and the use of PCBs after October 11, 1977, unless otherwise
permitted. While section 6(e)(2)(A) of TSCA bans the use of PCBs in any manner other than a totally enclosed manner,
section 6(e)(2)(B) provides that the Administrator may by rule authorize the use of PCBs if such use will not present
an unreasonable risk of injury to health or the environment. Section 6(e)(3)(A) of TSCA prohibits the manufacture,
processing, and distribution in commerce of PCBs except for the distribution in commerce of PCBs that were sold for
purposes other than resale before July 1, 1979. Section 6(e)(3)(B) provides that any person may petition the Administrator
for an exemption from the prohibition on the manufacture, processing, and distribution in commerce of PCBs. The Administrator
may by rule grant an exemption if the Administrator finds that:
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->
(i) an unreasonable risk of injury to health or the environment would not result, and (ii) good faith efforts have been
made to develop a chemical substance which does not present an unreasonable risk of injury to health or the environment
and which may be substituted for such polychlorinated biphenyl.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Section 6(e)(1) also authorizes EPA to regulate the disposal of PCBs consistent with the provisions in section 6(e)(2)
and (3). EPA has issued a regulation that authorizes the import for disposal of PCBs with concentrations below 50 ppm.
PCBs with greater concentrations, currently may only be imported for disposal pursuant to an exemption granted by
EPA based upon the criteria discussed above.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
EPA's Interim Procedural Rules for manufacturing, processing, and distribution in commerce exemptions describes
the required content for the manufacturing, processing, and distribution in commerce exemption petitions and the
procedures EPA follows in rulemaking on exemption petitions. Those rules are codified at 40 CFR 750.10 through 750.41.
These rules were amended effective April 11, 1994, by notice in the 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 -->
Federal Register
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 (59 FR 16991). EPA's Procedural Rule for rulemaking under section 6 of TSCA, which governs use authorizations for
PCBs, is found at 40 CFR 750.1 through 750.9.

II. Findings Necessary to Grant Petitions 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 -->
A. Unreasonable Risk Finding
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Before granting an exemption petition, section 6(e)(3)(B)(i) of TSCA requires the Administrator to find that granting
an exemption would not result in an unreasonable risk of injury to health or the environment in the United States. Consistent
with the principle that persons seeking an exemption from a legislative prohibition bear the burden of demonstrating
eligibility for that exemption, EPA has interpreted this provision to require a petitioner to demonstrate that the
proposed activity would not pose an unreasonable risk.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
To determine whether a risk is unreasonable, EPA balances the probability that harm will occur to health or the environment
against the benefits to society from granting or denying each petition. (See generally, 15 U.S.C. 2605(c)(1).) Specifically,
EPA considers the following factors: 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
1.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
 Effects of PCBs on human health and the environment.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 In deciding whether to grant an exemption, EPA considers the magnitude of exposure and the effects of PCBs on humans
and the environment. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
a.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
 Health effects.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 EPA has determined that PCBs are toxic and persistent. PCBs can enter the body through the lungs, gastrointestinal
tract, and skin, can circulate throughout the body, and can be stored in the fatty tissue. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
b.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
 Environmental effects.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 Certain PCB congeners are among the most stable chemicals known, which decompose very slowly once they are released
in the environment. PCBs are absorbed and stored in the fatty tissue of higher organisms as they bioaccumulate up the
food chain through invertebrates, fish, and mammals. This ultimately results in human exposure through consumption
of PCB-containing food sources. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
c.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
 Risks
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
. Toxicity and exposure are the two basic components of risk. Based on animal data, EPA concluded that in addition to
chloracne, PCBs may cause developmental toxicity, reproductive effects, and oncogenicity in humans. EPA also concluded
that PCBs present a hazard to the environment.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
A lengthy discussion of these factors is provided in the preamble to the August 24, 1988 proposed exemption rule (53
FR 32327). 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
2.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
 Benefits and costs.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 The benefits to society of granting an exemption vary, depending on the activity for which the exemption is requested.
The reasonably ascertainable costs of denying an exemption vary, depending on the individual petition. EPA has taken
benefits and costs into consideration when evaluating each exemption petition. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 -->
B. Good Faith Efforts Finding 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Section 6(e)(3)(B)(ii) of TSCA also requires the Administrator to find that ``good faith efforts have been made to
develop a chemical substance which does not present an unreasonable risk of injury to health or the environment and
which may be substituted for [PCBs].'' Based upon general legal principles allocating the burden of proof to the person
seeking to qualify for an exemption, EPA has interpreted this provision to require that a petitioner has the burden
of demonstrating that it has made the requisite good faith efforts. EPA considers several factors in determining
whether good faith efforts have been made. For each petition, EPA considers the kind of exemption the petitioner is
requesting and whether the petitioner expended time and effort to develop or search for a substitute. In each case,
the burden is on the petitioner to show specifically what they did to substitute non-PCB material for PCBs or to show
why it was not feasible to substitute non-PCBs for PCBs. To satisfy this finding for requests for an exemption to import
PCBs, a petitioner must show why such activity must occur in the United States and what steps will be taken to eliminate
the need to import PCBs in the future.

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 -->
III. Explanation of Class Exemption for Research and Development 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Distinct from its authority to exempt PCBs from the ban on manufacturing, processing, and distribution in commerce,
EPA may also authorize the use of PCBs. EPA authorized, indefinitely, the use of PCBs in small quantities for research
and development in the Use Authorization Rule, 40 CFR 761.30(j), published in the 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 -->
Federal Register
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 of July 10, 1984 (49 FR 28154). ``Small quantities for research and development'' is defined at 40 CFR 761.3 as ``any
quantity of PCBs (1) that is originally packaged in one or more hermetically sealed containers of a volume of no more
than 5.0 milliliters, and (2) that is used only for purposes of scientific experimentation or analysis, or chemical
research on, or analysis of PCBs, but not for research or analysis for the development of a PCB product.'' 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The processing and distribution in commerce of PCBs in small quantities for use in research and development is allowed
under a class exemption in the PCB Exemptions Rule, 40 CFR 761.80(g), published in the 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 -->
Federal Register
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 of August 8, 1986 (51 FR 28556). This rule eliminated the need for each person who wishes to process and distribute small
quantities of PCBs in commerce for research and development to file an individual exemption petition. EPA placed
the following terms and conditions on the class exemption: That all processors and distributors maintain records
of their PCB activities for a period of 5 years; and that any person or company that expects to distribute in commerce
100 grams (0.22 lb.) or more of PCBs for research and development within a 1&hyph;year period must report to EPA and
identify the sites of PCB activities and the quantities of PCBs to be distributed in commerce. The processor or distributor
could process and distribute PCBs in commerce and, provided it gives proper prior notification to EPA, increase the
amounts of PCBs that are processed and distributed in commerce, until EPA takes action to issue a final rule that changes
(e.g., terminates) the applicability of the exemption at 761.80(g) to the processor or distributor. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In granting a class exemption, EPA retains the authority to terminate the class exemption, or to exclude any distributor
from the class exemption, upon determining the activities allowed in the class exemption will pose an unreasonable
risk of injury to health or the environment. Any changes in the disposition of the class exemption, or the status of
individuals within the class exemption, will be accomplished through notice and comment rulemaking and members
of the class will be allowed to continue activities until a final rule is promulgated.

IV. Disposition of Pending Exemption Petitions 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 -->
A. Import
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
EPA received eight exemption petitions to import PCBs. Two of these petitions were withdrawn by the petitioners.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
1. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
S.D.Myers, Inc. (Myers).
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 EPA has received a total of four petitions from S.D. Myers, Inc. of Talmadge, Ohio, to import large volumes of PCB waste
from Canada for disposal. The first petition was received by EPA on May 15, 1991, the second and third were both received
on September 9, 1992, and the fourth was received on October 27, 1993.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
a.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
 Current petitions.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 Myers processes PCBs for disposal. It has received approval from EPA to: disassemble, decontaminate, and recycle
capacitors, to operate a mobile PCB disposal process, and it has received interim approval to commercially store
PCBs.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The petition received on May 15, 1991 (Petition 1) is to import drained PCB Transformers from Canada for purposes of
disposal at Myers' facility in Talmadge, Ohio. The petition requests a 5&hyph;year exemption, without a limit on
quantity. Petition 1 cites data that 21,000 PCB Transformers are in storage for disposal in Canada, and that an additional
10,000 PCB Transformers are still in service, but could be imported for disposal. Myers estimates that if all 31,000
transformers were imported into the United States, approximately 1.8 million pounds of PCBs in those transformers
would enter the United States. Once at Myers' facility, the transformers would be disposed of in accordance with Myers'
permit from EPA Region V. The transformers would be disassembled, metallic portions would be decontaminated and
subsequently smelted for metal recovery, and residual PCBs and porous materials would be shipped off site to a TSCA-permitted
incinerator.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Myers' second petition, received on September 9, 1992, (Petition 2) is to import intact, non-leaking PCB Capacitors
from Canada for disposal. The capacitors would be disposed of by Myers through a disassembly, decontamination, and
materials recycling process similar to its transformer process. Myers is permitted by EPA Region V to process capacitors
for disposal. Petition 2 requests a 5&hyph;year exemption, with no limit on quantity. Myers states that there are
18.6 million pounds of PCB capacitors in Canada, and estimates that 13 million pounds of PCB waste requiring incineration
would be generated by the processing of these capacitors at its facility.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The third petition, also received on September 9, 1992, (Petition 3) is a request to import askarel PCB liquids (500
ppm and over) from Canada to the United States for purposes of disposal. The petition cites data that 40 million pounds
of high-concentration fluid is present in Canada. Myers would transport the PCBs to a TSCA-approved incinerator
for disposal. The PCBs would not be disposed of at Myers' Talmadge, Ohio, facility, but some might be stored there before
being incinerated elsewhere. Myers is a permitted PCB transporter and has interim approval as a commercial storer
of PCBs. Petition 3 also requests a 5&hyph;year period with no limit on quantity.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Myers' fourth petition, received by EPA on October 27, 1993, (Petition 4) is to import intact, non-leaking PCB-containing
fluorescent light ballasts from Canada for disposal. The ballasts would be taken to Myers' facility, where they would
be processed to recover reclaimable metals, and the contaminated materials remaining would be shipped off site to
a TSCA-approved incinerator. EPA Region V has permitted Myers' ballast disposal method. Myers is requesting an exemption
for a 5&hyph;year period, and estimates that 60 million pounds of PCB containing light ballasts are present in Canada
[Canadian Government data from 1991 actually estimates that there are 60 million units present in Canada, which have
a total weight of 220 million pounds (see ``Canadian PCB Summary: A Summary of National PCB Inventory'' January, 1991)].
Myers provides estimates that indicate about 20 percent of the ballast weight would consist of unrecoverable PCB
waste [44 million pounds] requiring incineration.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In all four petitions, Myers asserts that since EPA has permitted their disposal processes based on the fact that these
processes do not pose an unreasonable risk of injury to health or the environment, this finding should be applied to
any PCB waste imported from Canada for purposes of disposal. Petition 3, which does not involve in-house disposal
activities but only transportation and storage, cites the overall safety record and safety procedures of the company
as grounds for a no unreasonable risk finding, and specifically asserts that Myers' PCB tank truck fleet ``has not
had an accident or spill when moving PCBs.''
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In terms of benefits, Myers estimates in Petition 1 that by importing all of Canada's PCB transformers, it would generate
$180 million in service fees, and an additional $20 million in scrap metal sales. Petitions 2, 3 and 4 are estimated
to generate revenues of $46 million, $30 million, and $45 million, respectively. Myers estimates that Petition 3
would earn a profit of $20 million for Myers and the incinerators (the other petitions do not provide profit estimates).
In addition, Petitions 2 and 4 state that each would create an additional 20 jobs. Other benefits mentioned in the petitions
include speeding the removal of PCBs from North America and a lowering of disposal costs for companies in Canada.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In response to the good faith efforts criteria of TSCA section 6(e)(3)(B)(ii) have been met, Myers maintains in all
four petitions that this criteria is not applicable to his petitions. Petition 1 does, however, go on to state that
Myers has investigated the possibility of destroying these wastes in Canada, but concluded that it would not be politically
or economically feasible to do so.

 Proposed decision on petitions.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 EPA proposes to deny all four petitions from S.D. Myers. EPA has determined that the petitioner has failed to establish
that there is no unreasonable risk as required in TSCA section 6(e)(3)(B). The petitioner has not demonstrated how
the benefits accruing from granting these petitions would outweigh the risks inherent in the importation of PCB waste
as proposed by petitioner. In addition, EPA believes that the petitioner has failed to demonstrate that it has made
a good faith efforts to investigate and develop alternatives to import.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
EPA has already made a general determination that the import of PCBs into the United States and the distribution in
commerce of PCBs present an unreasonable risk of injury to human health and the environment [See 40 CFR 761.20 and 44
FR 31514, May 31, 1979]. EPA has also stated that ``[i]t is the clear intent of TSCA to minimize the addition of PCBs to
the environment of the United States.'' Id. Moreover, while EPA believes that there is always some risk inherent in
the import of any quantity of PCBs, the large quantities that Myers would import significantly increases the risk.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
All four of Myers' petitions would involve the importation, transportation, and disposal of very large quantities
of PCB waste. Taken together, they would account for most of Canada's PCB fluids at concentrations over 500 ppm, as
well as all of its PCB Transformers, PCB Capacitors and PCB-containing fluorescent light ballasts. Myers indicates
in the four petitions that over a 5 year period it wishes to import a total of approximately 300 million pounds of PCB
waste for disposal. Based on the data supplied in the petitions and supplemental information (see note to docket ``Calculations''),
EPA calculates that the four petitions could involve the importation of up to 457 million pounds of PCB waste into the
United States, for disposal either at Myers' Talmadge, Ohio facility, or, in the case of Petition 3, at an unspecified
TSCA-approved incinerator.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Prior to disposal, Myers would transport large quantities of PCB waste through the United States either to the Ohio
site or to an incinerator. Subsequent to Myers' disposal activity in Ohio, an additional 60 to 90 million pounds of
concentrated PCB waste (not counting any additional solvents and process waste that Myers would generate) would
have to be transported from Ohio to a TSCA-approved incinerator. Currently, the closest available incinerator is
located in Coffeyville, Kansas (Aptus, Inc.). In information supplemental to the petitions, Myers estimates that
an average truckload for such waste would weigh 40,000 pounds. Using this estimate, EPA calculates that 7,500 to 11,750
truckloads of waste would be shipped to Talmadge, and an additional 1,500 to 2,250 truckloads would be shipped from
Talmadge for incineration.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Myers has failed to demonstrate that the proposed activity would not pose a risk to health and environment in the United
States. The introduction and disposal of large volumes of PCBs would pose some risk of exposure, even if the PCBs are
disposed of in an EPA-permitted facility such as Myers' Ohio facility or other TSCA-approved incinerator. In addition,
the large volumes of PCBs that would be transported to various facilities in different parts of the United States pose
a potential risk of spills or other exposure to PCBs despite the past safety record of the transporting company.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Myers also has failed to submit adequate information with respect to the benefits of the proposed activity. Myers
states that one of the benefits would be additional revenues for the company. With the exception of Petition 3, however,
Myers has provided revenue information only with respect to gross revenues. Gross revenue estimates tend to overinflate
the actual financial benefit to the petitioner. To properly evaluate the financial impacts, EPA needs additional
information regarding any costs that might offset projected gross revenues.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In addition, Myers has failed to substantiate its claim that the United States would benefit by the removal of PCBs
that are stored in Canada and the elimination of possible risk of crossborder contamination. EPA acknowledges that
there is a possibility that some PCBs stored in Canada could pose some risk to health or environment in the United States.
Myers, however, has not presented factual information to demonstrate why PCBs stored in Canada pose such a risk or
to show the extent of the risk to health and environment in the United States.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Canadian government regulates the storage and disposal of PCBs in that country which should provide adequate
protection against releases or spills that could threaten the United States. Moreover, Canada possesses a domestic
disposal facility, and is in the process of expanding its PCB disposal resources (Memo from Bryan to Greenwood, June
25, 1991). The government also has some mobile disposal facilities. Id. Some of these facilities may be available
to dispose of the PCBs that Myers proposes to import into the United States.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Myers also states that lowered disposal costs for Canadian companies constitute an additional benefit of the proposed
activities. Under TSCA, however, EPA does not consider benefits that may occur accrue to foreign businesses, just
as it does not consider risks that do not threaten domestic health or the environment.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
EPA is proposing to deny Myers' petitions because Myers has failed to demonstrate that the risks of the proposed activity
are reasonable when weighed against the benefits, particularly in view of the limited information available to substantiate
the alleged benefits.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Myers contends that the proposed disposal activities do not pose an unreasonable risk by noting that the facilities
that would dispose of the PCBs are permitted by EPA pursuant to 40 CFR 761.60(e). Section 761.60(e) authorizes EPA
to issue a permit if the method of destroying PCBs will not present an unreasonable risk of injury to health or the environment.
Under this provision, EPA weighs the risk of the disposal methodology against the benefits to the health and environment
in the United States. The fact that EPA has determined that the benefits outweigh the risks when the activity involves
the disposal of domestic PCBs that are already present in the United States, however, does not demonstrate that the
benefits outweigh the risks when the activity involves disposing of foreign PCBs that would be introduced into this
country. The introduction of additional PCBs that would otherwise not be in the United States adds an additional factor
to the risk/benefit equation.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
EPA further finds grounds to deny the petitions based on the good faith efforts criteria of TSCA section 6(e)(3)(B)(ii).
Petition 1 maintains that this criteria is ``not really applicable,'' in that Myers only wishes to import PCBs for
disposal, and not for use in commerce; however, the petition does go on to discuss other disposal options. The subsequent
three petitions simply state that the good faith efforts criteria does not apply, and provide no discussion of alternatives.
While, strictly speaking, section 6(e)(3)(B)(ii) refers to finding substitute chemicals, EPA believes that under
this section it must generally consider the issues of the availability of alternatives, and the overall necessity
for granting an exemption. The alternative to importation of Canadian PCB waste into the United States for destruction
is to destroy those wastes in Canada itself. Myers maintains in Petition 1 that it has investigated the possibility
of setting up a facility in Canada to recycle/destroy PCB Transformers, and it concluded that it would be uneconomical
and politically difficult to establish a facility in Canada. However, Myers fails to demonstrate that establishing
a facility in Canada is not feasible; rather, Myers only forwards arguments as to why doing so is less expedient and
less profitable for Myers than importing the waste to its existing facility in the United States. Myers does not provide
any evidence that it made substantial good faith efforts to pursue such an option before it petitioned the Agency for
this exemption. More importantly, Canada already possess a domestic disposal facility, and is in the process of expanding
its PCB disposal resources. There are no technological barriers to the effective destruction of PCBs in Canada that
would necessitate their shipment to the United States for safe disposal. Myers has not demonstrated the necessity
for the PCBs in question to be imported to the United States for disposal, and accordingly EPA finds that all four petitions
have failed to meet the good faith efforts criteria.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Although Myers has not submitted adequate information to allow the Agency to make the requisite findings for these
four specific exemptions to import Canadian PCBs for disposal, EPA is considering whether to amend existing PCB disposal
rules to modify the general restriction on the import of PCBs with 50 ppm or greater for disposal. EPA believes that
opening the border to allow import for disposal may have far-reaching consequences and that it is preferable to raise
the issue of the transboundry movement of PCB waste generally in the proposed disposal rules rather than to examine
it in isolation in the context of individual company's petitions for exemption. In the proposed disposal rules, EPA
is requesting comment on the circumstances under which the United States border should be opened to the transboundry
shipments of PCBs for disposal. The proposal, if finalized, would retain the general prohibitions on import of PCB
wastes at concentrations of 50 ppm or greater, with certain exceptions described in more detail in the preamble to
the proposed disposal rule.

 Gene Rideout Dangerous Goods Consultants, Inc. (DGC).

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 On December 27, 1993, Dangerous Goods submitted an exemption petition to import laboratory samples from Canada for

. The petitioner requests to import PCB waste samples, primarily soil samples, not to exceed 5 kilograms total weight.
DGC estimates that samples would be shipped no more than once a week. Assuming weekly shipments of 5 kilograms each,
approximately 260 kilograms of soil and other media would be imported annually. If granted an exemption, DGC expresses
an intent to renew their exemption for up to 5 years. Treatability analysis would be conducted at unidentified client
laboratories in the United States (DGC is a consulting firm and does not operate its own laboratory facilities). The
petitioner claims that PCBs in the waste samples would normally be destroyed during treatment and analysis, but if
any remained, the residuals could be returned to Canada if EPA so stipulates. According to DGC, the capability to treat/analyze
such PCB waste samples does not exist in Canada at this time, but at least one U.S. laboratory possesses such technology.
DGC believes that such capability should be developed in Canada within 4 or 5 years time. DGC does not claim any economic
losses to the United States would result from a petition denial, but it maintains that without this exemption, PCB-contaminated
soil in Canada will remain untreated until Canada develops this laboratory technology domestically.

 Proposed decision on petition.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 EPA proposes to deny this exemption petition. EPA has determined that, in general, the import (manufacture) of PCBs
into the United States and the distribution in commerce of PCBs present an unreasonable risk of injury to health and
the environment [See 40 CFR 761.20 and 44 FR 31514, May 31, 1979]. EPA has also stated that ``[i]t is the clear intent
of TSCA to minimize the addition of PCBs to the environment of the United States.'' Id. DGC has not demonstrated what
benefits would accrue to the United States through the granting of its petition, and how those benefits would outweigh
the risk inherent in importation of PCB wastes. Accordingly, EPA cannot make the finding that granting this petition
will not present an unreasonable risk of injury to health or the environment.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In addition, EPA finds that the petitioner has failed to satisfy the good faith efforts criterion, i.e., DGC has not
demonstrated that there is no viable alternative to importing these samples into the United States. According to
the Canadian Association for Environmental Analytical Laboratories, there are laboratories within Canada capable
of conducting PCB analysis. The petition does not provide any details on the unidentified U.S. laboratory's techniques,
why the Canadian laboratories are unable to provide such analysis, or why developing such technologies would take
Canadian laboratories so long. Further, the petition fails to justify how the shipment of individual laboratory
samples to the United States will expedite the cleanup of PCB-contaminated sites in Canada: cleanup of these sites
will not occur until the Canadians develop their own domestic ability to apply such technologies

countries to develop their own capacity for properly handling and disposing of PCB waste. [See 45 FR 29115, May 1, 1980].
The Agency believes that granting this petition might actually hinder Canadian efforts to develop a domestic treatment
capability.

 The sample sizes would be 2.5 milliliters per sample of oil. These samples would then be analyzed for PCB content. Following
their analysis, waste oil 499 ppm or less would be recycled in a high efficiency boiler at Big Stone Utility; and waste
oil 500 ppm or greater would be sent to Aptus for incineration. Jaco estimates that based on a submittal rate of 50,000
samples per year, the total volume of PCBs to be imported would be 6 gallons. Jaco maintains that historical laboratory
data indicates that less than 5 percent of the samples are in the PCB classification (over 50 ppm). In addition, Jaco
estimates that their volume of waste oil greater than 499 ppm would only increase by 3 gallons annually.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
During analysis, Jaco states that the 1 microliter injected into the Gas Chromatograph (GC) is destroyed in the destructive
detector and the residual oil from this process contains no PCBs since the extraction process removes the PCBs from
the oil. Further, the 9.4 milliliters of 2,2,4-trimethylpentane that is used in the extraction process and remaining
after the GC sample is run, is separated from the acid and reclaimed in a distillation process for reuse. This recycling
of the solvent used in the extraction eliminates the need for solvent disposal.

Jaco states that the economic consequences of denial would be greater for the Canadian utilities. In their petition,
Jaco indicates that Canadian utilities currently pay $100.00 per sample, while Jaco's cost is $15.00 per sample.
Jaco maintains that denial of their petition would limit the growth of Jaco (4 additional jobs) and the number of non-farm
jobs available in Eastern Washington State.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The petitioner states that the no unreasonable risk criteria would be met because no handling of the PCBs would take
place outside of an experienced laboratory. Transportation of the samples would be according to International Air
Transportation Authority (IATA) guidelines. In quantifying the economic consequences if their petition were denied,
the petitioner states that there is major economic benefit to be realized, but an accurate estimate of the economic
impact cannot be given at this time. Moreover, the petitioner believes that it may be liable if this activity is not

 Sigma-Aldrich states that they obtain PCBs for environmental monitoring purposes from companies already exempted
by EPA. These PCBs are analyzed for quality control by highly trained chemists using gas chromatography and then prepared
as analytical reference standards.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The PCB standards are prepared in concentrations not exceeding 1,000 micrograms per milliliter in organic solvent.
The standards will be packaged in volumes of 1 milliliter in flame sealed amber glass ampules. The ampules will be packaged
using die-cut cardboard inserts that hold the ampules securely in place inside a rigid cardboard box which will be
overpacked in a box that has been tested, certified and labelled according to Department of Transportation (DOT)
specifications. Sigma-Aldrich also states that all shipping will be done in observance of all domestic and foreign
transportation requirements. The processing of these standards will be performed at the Sigma-Aldrich facility
at 3500 DeKalb Street, St. Louis, Missouri. The maximum total volume of PCB solution will not exceed 5 liters and the
maximum total PCB volume contained in the solution will not exceed 5 milliliters. Sigma-Aldrich estimates that the
total amount of PCBs to be exported in 1 year will not exceed 100 grams or 0.220 pounds.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
According to Sigma-Aldrich the analytical work will generate a wastestream that contains a maximum of 2.5 milligrams
of PCBs, while the processing wastestream will not exceed 5.0 milligrams of PCBs. Sigma-Aldrich states that these
wastestreams will be handled in accordance with 40 CFR part 761, subpart K. In its petition, Sigma-Aldrich also states
that through customer screening they will ensure proper handling of the materials by qualified personnel. Sigma-Aldrich
estimates that denial of this petition will result in a loss in revenue of $60,000 per year.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

In a letter dated March 24, 1994, Sigma-Aldrich amended their petition to include an exemption to export small quantities
of Carbon 14-labelled PCBs for sale to foreign customers for use in the performance of metabolic and environmental
fate studies. Sigma-Aldrich synthesizes Carbon 14-labeled PCBs in small quantities for metabolism and environmental
research according to their existing exemption. Sigma-Aldrich's existing exemption for manufacturing PCBs for
these products is in the name of Pathfinder Laboratory which is now the Radiochemicals Department of Sigma Chemical
Company (part of Sigma-Aldrich Corporation).
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The petitioner states that these Carbon-14 PCBs are analyzed by highly trained chemists using high pressure liquid
chromatography in a quality control laboratory. Packaging for these items consists of flame-sealed glass ampules
containing less than 0.5 milliliters of solvent. The primary container is overpacked using packing material and
a second box that is DOT specified and labeled. The petitioner also states that if the petition is granted, applicable
foreign requirements for air, land and water transportation will be followed. In addition, the wastestream that
is produced during the synthesis and analysis will be absorbed on silica gel and solidified in concrete prior to storage
in compliance with Nuclear Regulatory Commission requirements. The activity for this petition will be conducted

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 EPA proposes to grant the Sigma-Aldrich an exemption for 1 year to export small quantities of PCBs for research and
development under 761.80(c). The Agency generally treats petitions for exemption to export PCBs more stringently
than petitions to distribute PCBs within the United States. This is because once the PCBs cross beyond our borders,
the United States loses its ability to monitor the handling and distribution activities, to inspect the receiving
facilities for any regulatory violations, or to protect health or the environment from releases of those PCBs that
might lead to additional PCB contamination in this country. However, EPA believes that those concerns are mitigated
in the export of PCBs in small quantities for research and development particularly given the viscosity, quantity,
marking, and packaging of the PCBs, as well as the careful handling of the PCBs by trained personnel as described in
the petition and amendment. Since there are no substitutes for PCB analytical samples, the good faith efforts finding
has been met.

Sigma-Aldrich would be prohibited from exporting PCBs in excess of the amounts and quantities specified in its petition
(i.e., less than 100 grams/year - Petition 1 and less than 2.5 grams/year - Amendment), and would be required to petition
EPA and obtain an exemption prior to an increase in the quantity or a change in the manner of handling PCBs under the Sigma-Aldrich
exemption. EPA would consider any such change as a new exemption petition and address the request by rulemaking. If
Sigma-Aldrich were to wish to continue its export activities beyond the 1&hyph;year timeframe under the EPA approved

The petitioners predict that 250 to 500 kits will be sold overseas per year. Based on these numbers each kit would contain
6.7 micrograms of Aroclor 1248 in 0.3 milliliters of methanol, yielding a total of 0.0017 to 0.00335 grams of Aroclor
1248 in 75 to 150 milliliters of methanol exported in a year. The petitioners state that the kits will expand existing
conventional technologies such as gas chromatography and mass spectroscopy by offering a safe, reliable, economic,
and expedient way of screening negative samples from positive samples. Positive samples are later confirmed with
conventional techniques and are disposed of in accordance with applicable regulations.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
There are no substitutes available which can be used to accurately determine the presence of PCBs, since known concentrations
of PCBs must be used in the calibrators that contain known concentrations of PCBs. The petitioners estimate that the

 EPA proposes to grant Millipore Corporation and ImmunoSystems, Inc. an exemption for 1 year to export small quantities
of PCB for research and development under 761.80(c). As stated above, EPA generally treats petitions for exemption
to export PCBs more stringently than petitions to distribute PCBs within the United States. This is because once the
PCBs cross beyond our borders, the United States loses its ability to monitor the handling and the distribution activities,
to inspect the receiving facilities for any regulatory violations, or to protect health or the environment from releases
of those PCBs that might lead to additional PCB contamination in this country. However, EPA believes that those concerns
are mitigated in the export of PCBs in small quantities for research and development particularly given the viscosity
and quantity of the PCBs involved, as well as the careful handling of the PCBs by trained personnel as described in the

 On July 1, 1991, NIST submitted an exemption petition to export small quantities of PCBs for research and development
to the international monitoring community for use in the identification and quantification of environmental contaminants.

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 NIST currently offers for sale Standard Reference Materials (SRMs) that were produced and/or characterized with
financial support from U.S. Government Agencies, including EPA. These SRMs were used for environmental monitoring
and research. The petitioner states that these SRMs in the form of Aroclor mixtures and as individual isomers, both
neat and in solution are distributed in sealed 2 milliliter ampules pursuant to the class exemption at 40 CFR 761.80(g).
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
NIST states that the PCBs they analyze are obtained from commercial sources. Once received, these PCBs are analyzed
by their Organic Analytical Division and/or the Gas and Particulate Science Division. The petitioner maintains
that the material is handled by professional scientists and technicians. Once the analysis is complete, the petitioner
states that the liquids are packaged in hermetically sealed ampules and the sediment is contained in amber bottles
by trained staff following proper safety precautions. The materials are packaged using the NIST logo which indicates
the presence of PCBs. The petitioner states that the PCB materials received for SRM development are analyzed for their
content only, no residual material is produced. Each SRM is accompanied by a certificate that provides the results
of the characterization and indicates the intended use of the material. In addition, the petitioner states that because
of their congressional mandate to serve as the nation's physical laboratory and the legal ramifications of a certified
NIST SRM, other governments, industry and others seek out NIST for its SRMs.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Edwin C. Kraemer
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
. On January 30, 1993, Edwin C. Kraemer requested an exemption to process and distribute in commerce products made
from PCB containing car shredder waste or fluff.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
a. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Current petition.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 In the petition, Edwin Kraemer states that he seeks to use a procedure that converts car shredder waste or fluff (less
than 50 ppm) into a product filler which will constitute a commodity in trade. The process Mr. Kraemer proposes to use
is a mechanical process which specializes in grinding to a microstructure size resulting in filler material. Mr.
Kraemer maintains that these fillers can be flame retarding, lightweight, compressible, absorbent, and have sound
proofing, thermal insulating and energy absorbing characteristics. As described in the petition, items to be manufactured
using this process include, but are not limited to: product filler, absorbent, solid bulk filler, substitute for
concrete fill, ceiling tile, adobe block, brick, concrete block, insulation panels for walls and ceilings, packaging,
furniture and mattress stuffing, gymnastics mats, safety barriers, sound insulation, replacement for asbestos,
injection moulding filler, fire retardant coating, plaster board or building panel filler.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Mr. Kraemer proposes to conduct his initial work using material from the Orange County Steel Salvage Company which
he states is considered one of the most contaminated sites in the country where 50,000 tons of contaminated material
has been stockpiled. Based on the 50,000 tons of contaminated material, Mr. Kraemer estimates that 10,000,000 lbs.
will be processed onsite at a concentration of 30 ppm PCBS, for a total of 300 lbs of PCBs. Mr. Kraemer also asserts that
the PCB contamination is not the result of shredding appliances, motors and transformers or PCB Items, but is actually
attributable to the use of plastics and finishes in products.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The petitioner maintains that due to the low concentrations and the anticipated nonfriable uses, that any release
of PCBs to the environment is unlikely. In addition, the petitioner states that the predictable and anticipated level
of inadvertently generated PCBs in any end product will be kept under 25 ppm; therefore, the manufacturing or processing
for commercial purposes of products with PCB concentrations of less than 50 ppm should be excluded from the prohibitions
of TSCA section 6(e)(2) and (3). The petitioner states that he does not see a need for any special labelling, disposal
and recordkeeping requirements, since he is not producing a PCB Item, article, equipment or container.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The petitioner states that denial of this petition would eliminate a potential $18.5 million (cost for disposal)
savings for the State of California and a potential $50 million in profit. If the exemption is granted and the process
is successful, the petitioner states that it would generate employment, eliminate a hazardous waste, recycle a strategic
material, conserve landfill space and protect the environment and public safety on a long term basis.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 EPA proposes to deny the petition submitted by Edwin C. Kraemer. Although EPA agrees that conversion of fluff into
viable products for trade might ameliorate the disposal problem in the area of PCB-contaminated fluff, EPA would
not be able to make a finding of no unreasonable risk to health and the environment in this instance due to insufficient
data to support such a finding. EPA encourages the petitioner to continue to pursue research in this area in order to
generate more data in support of this petition. The good faith efforts criterion would have been met because the use
of a substitute is not applicable in this instance in that this proposal seeks to provide an alternative to disposal
for PCB-contaminated fluff.

 General Electric (GE).

 On November 16, 1992, GE submitted a petition to manufacture small quantities of PCBs for use on-site in EPA- authorized
research activities.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
a. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Current petition.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 GE seeks to synthesize small quantities of PCBs for use on-site in EPA-authorized activities. In the petition GE states
that ongoing and future research involving the remediation of PCB-contaminated media requires ready access to a
supply of individual PCB congeners of a known quality and quantity, which is currently not readily available commercially.
This activity would be conducted at GE-Corporate Research and Development, River and Van Antwerp Roads, Niskayuna,
New York, 12309.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The petitioner states that the PCB congeners will be synthesized only as necessary for specific EPA-authorized research
experiments while the amount of PCBs to be synthesized will be determined by the project specific requirements. The
petitioner estimates that the total amount of PCBs to be synthesized will be limited to 2 kilograms per year, and the
total amount of PCBs synthesized with bench-scale laboratory procedures will be limited to a maximum theoretical
yield of 150 grams or less per experiment.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The petitioner maintains that the accidental release of PCBs is prevented by the use of apparatus such as condensers,
cold traps, molecular sieves, or filters for retaining all reactants and reaction products. Also, reaction products
and waste materials will be analyzed for PCB content, handled and disposed of in accordance with applicable regulations.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
As described in the petition, PCB congeners are needed for research into developing alternative PCB remediation
methods and innovative PCB destruction methods; therefore, use of a PCB substitute would not be feasible.

Proposed decision on petition.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 EPA proposes to grant GE an exemption for 1 year to manufacture small quantities of PCBs for use on-site in EPA-authorized
activities. Because the research is being conducted by highly trained and experienced professionals under controlled
conditions and only small quantities are involved, EPA finds that no unreasonable risk will result from granting
an exemption to GE to manufacture small quantities of PCBs for use on-site in EPA-authorized research activities.
The good faith effort criterion has been met, because for research in development of alternative PCB remediation
methods and PCB destruction methods, use of a PCB substitute may not be possible.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
GE would be prohibited from manufacturing PCBs in excess of the amounts and quantities specified in their exemption
petition, and would be required to petition EPA to obtain an exemption prior to an increase in the quantity or a change
in the manner of handling PCBs under the GE exemption. EPA will consider any such change as a new exemption petition
and address the request by rulemaking. If GE were to wish to continue its export activities beyond the 1&hyph;year
timeframe according to the EPA approved exemption, a certified letter, pursuant to the amended Interim Procedural
Rules, would have to be submitted at least 6 months prior to the expiration of the exemption.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
a. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Current petition.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 Supelco seeks approval to manufacture individual pure PCB isomers in quantities of 0.02 to 0.04 pounds (i.e., 10 to
20 grams) each at its Supelco Park facility in Bellefonte, PA. The petitioner estimates that a 10 to 20 gram production
lot of an individual pure PCB isomer would represent a 3 to 5 year supply. Total annual production is projected at less
than 1 pound (i.e., 454 grams). The PCBs would be diluted in the microgram range and packaged for distribution in sealed
vials for solids and amber ampules for liquids in either 5 milliliter or 1 milliliter quantities. Waste materials
from the manufacture of PCBs would be manifested off-site for incineration in accordance with TSCA regulations.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
To produce unsymmetrical PCBs, Supelco proposes to use a modified Gomberg-Bachmann reaction. An aromatic amine,
an organic nitrite, and excess substrate are heated for several hours. Distillation under vacuum removes the remaining
substrate. Column chromatography and/or high pressure liquid chromatography yields the product. Supelco asserts
the merits of the method are that most of the starting materials are readily available from commercial sources, the
synthesis is a simple one-step reaction, the final products following chromatography are sufficiently pure (>97
percent), and the yields are relatively good (30 to 35 percent).
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
To produce symmetrical PCBs, Supelco proposes to use replacement reaction of biphenylsulfonic acid with carbon
tetrachloride. The reactants are heated in a Parr reactor for several hours at 250
<!-- PJG 0017 degreeslatlong -->
&cir; C and, after removal of excess solvent, the final product is obtained in high purity (>98 percent) and high yield
(>80 percent).
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The synthesis of PCBs would be conducted in a controlled access laboratory that has been constructed for the preparation
of hazardous chemicals by specially trained personnel in compliance with the Occupational Safety and Health Administration's
(OSHA's) requirements at 29 CFR part 1910, subpart Z. Standards would be distributed in sealed glass ampules, no larger
than 5 milliliters, to analytical laboratories with personnel trained in the handling of hazardous materials. Processing
and distribution in commerce activities would be conducted pursuant to the class exemption at 761.80(g), and although
processing activities would be expected to reach a maximum of 150 grams, distribution activities would not be expected
to exceed 100 grams and therefore would not trigger the reporting requirement of the class exemption.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Supelco maintains that since it has been selected as the private industry participant in a Cooperative Research and
Development Agreement (CRADA) to produce and distribute organic quality control samples for EPA's EMSL-Cincinnati
laboratory, the consequences of EPA's denial of its exemption would be a serious inconvenience to the EPA and an economic
loss of not less than $100,000 annually in potential sales to Supelco, Inc.

processing and distribution activities would be performed at the Supelco, Inc. facility at Supelco Park, Bellefonte,
PA.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Since no PCB substitutes exist for analytical standards, the good faith effort criterion does not apply. Granting
an exemption would benefit society by allowing important health, environmental, and analytical research to continue.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
EPA proposes to prohibit Supelco from manufacturing PCBs in excess of the amounts and quantities specified in its
petition (i.e., not to exceed 1 pound). Further exemptions beyond the 1&hyph;year period would be subject to the amended
Interim Procedural Rules at 40 CFR part 750. Supelco would be required to petition EPA to increase the amount of PCBs
handled, and to change the type of activities, the procedures for handling the PCBs, and any other term under the Supelco
exemption. EPA would consider any such change as a new exemption petition and address the request by rulemaking. If
Supelco were to wish to continue its manufacturing activities beyond the 1&hyph;year timeframe, a letter sent by
certified mail would have to be received by EPA at least 6 months prior to the expiration of the exemption pursuant to
the amended Interim Procedural Rules.

congener in milligram quantities, and then diluted to the necessary concentration for the appropriate standard.
Chemsyn also will import some standards containing PCBs that will be made in Canada by its partner, Wellington Laboratories.
All the PCB standards will be flame sealed in 2 ml ampoules, and will contain less than 1

g PCB per vial dissolved in 1.2 ml solvent. The PCB standards will be packaged and shipped in accordance with DOT shipping
requirements. Chemsyn literature indicates that all toxic preparations are shipped with documentation sheets
describing known hazards. Chemsyn expects production waste generation to be minimal due to the small production
rate and batch size involved. These wastes will be treated as PCB wastes. Chemsyn asserts that it has a highly trained

 Proposed decision on petition.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 EPA proposes to grant the Chemsyn petition for manufacture, import, and export PCBs. EPA has previously established
the need for analytical standards [49 FR 28154, July 10, 1984]. Because of this need, the small quantity limitations,
and the carefully controlled conditions of PCB manufacture, EPA finds that no unreasonable risk would result from
granting an exemption to Chemsyn to manufacture PCBs in small quantities for research or development. This finding
also applies to the import of samples from Chemsyn's Canadian partner, Wellington Laboratories, provided that the
imported samples are prepared, packaged, and labeled in the same manner as domestically produced samples. Because
the manufacture of these analytical standards is being conducted by highly trained and experienced professionals
under controlled conditions and only small quantities are involved, EPA finds that no unreasonable risk would result
from granting this exemption. As such, EPA does not believe that the importation of these standards, when compared
with their domestic manufacture, would pose any added risk to health or the environment.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Agency generally treats petitions for exemption to export PCBs more stringently than petitions to distribute
PCBs within the United States. This is because once the PCBs cross beyond our borders, the United States loses its ability
to monitor the handling and distribution activities, to inspect the receiving facilities for any regulatory violations,
or to protect health or the environment from releases of those PCBs that might lead to additional PCB contamination
in this country. However, EPA believes that those concerns are mitigated in the export of PCBs in small quantities
for research and development particularly given the quantity, marking, and packaging of the PCBs, as well as the careful
handling of the PCBs by trained laboratory personnel. This finding would be consistent with previous determinations
regarding the export of PCB analytical samples for research and development [49 FR 28154].
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
EPA has determined that the good faith efforts finding would be met for petitions to manufacture, import, distribute
or export PCBs in small quantities on projects consistent with the overall purposes of section 6(e) of TSCA, such as
using PCBs as standards for the purpose of measuring PCB concentrations or using PCBs in the study of health and environmental
effects of PCBs, because, in these cases, there are no PCB substitutes. There will always be a need for pure analytical
standards to be developed to support laboratory analysis for PCBs. Also, pure PCBs are needed in critical health and
environmental research because commercial PCBs contain mixtures of isomers and contaminants which may adversely
affect experimental research.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Chemsyn would be prohibited from exporting PCBs in excess of the amounts and quantities specified in its petition
(i.e., less than 50 grams/year), and would be required to petition EPA and obtain an exemption prior to an increase
in the quantity or a change in the manner of handling PCBs under the Chemsyn exemption. EPA would consider any such change
as a new exemption petition and address the request by rulemaking. If Chemsyn were to wish to continue its export activities
beyond the 1&hyph;year timeframe under the EPA approved exemption, a certified letter, pursuant to the amended Interim
Procedural Rules, must be submitted to EPA at least 6 months prior to the expiration of the exemption.

 Electric Apparatus Service Association (EASA).
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 On July 3, 1991, EASA submitted a petition requesting the renewal of their exemption which was originally granted
in the May 22, 1990 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 -->
Federal Register
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 (55 FR 21023). This exemption allowed EASA members, for a period of 1 year, to process and distribute in commerce for
reuse non-porous component parts from PCB-Contaminated Transformers that have been double washed and rinsed. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
a.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
 Background.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 EPA determined in granting the original exemption that, due to the non-porous nature of these component parts and,
also, because of the relatively small amounts of PCBs involved, the activity of reusing component parts presents
no unreasonable risk to health and the environment.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Regarding the benefits to society of granting this exemption, EASA maintained that, without access to their stockpiles
of component parts, both economic loss to the member companies and detriment to the society would be incurred. EASA
asserted that its members may be put out of business if reuse of these components were prohibited, due to their inability
to repair transformers during the activities of buying and selling used transformers and servicing customers' transformers.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Although EPA made no judgement regarding this claim, EPA acknowledged that without stocks of component parts, many
transformers could not be repaired promptly and equipment users could experience interruptions of electrical services
and could be forced to prematurely dispose of reusable units.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
To support its claim of good faith efforts to reduce inventories of PCB-contaminated components, EASA submitted
evidence of their efforts to develop a double-rinse method to remove PCBs from the non-porous component parts that
would be reused on the PCB-Contaminated Transformers. This double-rinse procedure employs a protocol similar to
that in EPA's Spill Cleanup Policy (40 CFR part 761, subpart G). EASA maintained that the introduction of double-rinsed,
non-porous component parts back onto the PCB-Contaminated Transformers would not change the original parts per
million PCB content of the transformer into which the component part is incorporated.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
EPA concluded that the processing and distribution in commerce of the PCB residues on non-porous, double-rinsed
transformer component parts as well as the buying and selling of PCB or PCB-Contaminated Transformers that have been
serviced with double-rinsed, non-porous parts, meets both the no unreasonable risk and good faith effort criteria.
EPA granted this class exemption for 1 year.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
EPA decided that in future requests for renewal of their (EASA) exemption, that EPA would consider the petitioner's
evidence of no unreasonable risk and good faith efforts by evaluating whether stockpiles of component parts have
been effectively decontaminated and also whether inventories of PCB and PCB-Contaminated Transformers in EASA's
contained storage areas have been reduced.

 Current petition
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
. In this petition EASA seeks to renew their exemption to process and distribute in commerce for reuse non-porous component
parts from PCB-Contaminated Transformers that have been double washed/rinsed as granted in the May 22, 1990 FR 21023.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
EASA has submitted two additional reports from T R Service Company to support that the double wash/rinse method is
effective to decontaminate non-porous components. As described in the renewal petition, one report showed that
20 samples were taken from 10 transformers and all showed PCB concentrations of less than 10 micrograms per 100 square
centimeters.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
On June 12, 1990 the petitioner stated that it surveyed its members and of those that responded, only 20 percent were
still handling mineral oil transformers 50 ppm or greater. In the petitioner's opinion the number of members with
inventories of 50 ppm to less than 500 ppm has decreased significantly.

as set forth in their original exemption.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 -->
A. Executive Order 12866
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Under Executive Order 12866 (58 FR 51735, October 4, 1993), the Agency must determine whether the regulatory action
is ``significant'' and therefore subject to review by the Office of Management and Budget (OMB) and the requirements
of the Executive Order. Under section 3(f), the order defines a ``significant regulatory action'' as an action that
is likely to result in a rule (1) having an annual effect on the economy of $100 million or more, or adversely and materially
affecting a sector of the economy, productivity, competition, jobs, the environment, public health or safety, or
State, local or tribal governments or communities (also referred to as ``economically significant''); (2) creating
serious inconsistency or otherwise interfering with an action taken or planned by another agency; (3) materially
altering the budgetary impacts of entitlements, grants, user fees, or loan programs or the rights and obligations
of recipients thereof; or (4) raising novel legal or policy issues arising out of legal mandates, the President's
priorities, or the principles set forth in this Executive Order.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Pursuant to terms of this Executive Order, it has been determined that this rule is not ``significant'' and is therefore
not subject to OMB review. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 -->
B. Regulatory Flexibility Act
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Pursuant to the Regulatory Flexibility Act (the Act), 5 U.S.C. 603, EPA must perform a regulatory flexibility analysis
for all rules that are likely to have a ``significant impact on a substantial number of small entities.'' Pursuant
to section 605(b) of the Regulatory Flexibility Act, which provides that section 603 of the Act ``shall not apply to
any proposed or final rule if the Agency certifies that the rule will not, if promulgated, have a significant economic
impact on a substantial number of small entities'', EPA certifies that this rule will not have a significant impact
on a substantial number of small entities. In addition, EPA is sending a copy of this rule to the Chief Counsel for Advocacy
of the Small Business Administration. Section 6(e)(3)(A) and (B) of TSCA and EPA's PCB Ban Rule, 40 CFR part 761, prohibits
the manufacture, processing, and distribution in commerce of PCBs. This rule, under section 6(e)(3)(B) of TSCA,
would exempt persons from these prohibitions where petitioners have demonstrated that granting an exemption would
not result in an unreasonable risk of injury to health or the environment and that they have made good faith efforts
to develop substitutes for PCBs. Both small and large businesses must meet the same statutory standard. Thus, even
if EPA believed that it was an economically desirable policy to grant an exemption petition for a small business, it
could do so only if the small business met the requirements set forth in TSCA. This rule would not add to the burden placed
on small businesses, it would only remove the prohibition placed on such businesses through granting an exemption.
In essence, any impact from granting or denying a petition would only affect the petitioner.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Owners of individual small businesses who elect to petition the Administrator to engage in activities otherwise
banned by the statute have already considered the economic consequences of conducting these activities, and nonetheless
have opted to pursue an authorization for these activities. Finally, because this rule basically would benefit some
small entities, without imposing direct economic costs on others, EPA believes that it is appropriate to certify
that this rule will not have a significant economic impact on a substantial number of small entities.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The Paperwork Reduction Act of 1980, 44 U.S.C. 3501 et seq., authorizes the Director of the Office of Management and
Budget to review certain information collection requests by Federal Agencies. Under OMB Control Number 2070&hyph;0021,
OMB has approved a general information collection request submitted by EPA for purposes of collecting information
for rulemakings on PCB exemption petitions, and for any recordkeeping or reporting conditions to PCB exemption petitions
granted by EPA.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Public reporting burden for this collection of information is estimated to average five hours per response, including
time for reviewing instructions, searching existing data sources, gathering and maintaining the data needed, and
completing and reviewing the collection of information.
