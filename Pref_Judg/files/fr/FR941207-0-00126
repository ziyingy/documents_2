44. After considering the record, however, we have determined that gaming revenues generally are not subject to the
same types of legal restrictions as other revenues received by Indian tribes. Therefore, we establish a rebuttable
presumption that revenues derived from gaming pursuant to the Indian Gaming Regulatory Act, 25 U.S.C. 2701 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
et seq., 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
will be included in our calculations when determining whether an applicant that is affiliated with an Indian tribe
qualifies for the entrepreneurs' block or as a small business. Cook Inlet has set forth several reasons why we should
treat gaming revenues differently from other types of Indian tribe revenues. First, Cook Inlet argues that these
revenues were not part of the tribal economic picture when Congress enacted the SBA tribal exception to the affiliation
rule in 1970. Second, Cook Inlet contends that the Indian Gaming Regulatory Act provides certain Indian tribes with
a non-traditional source of revenue that could be very substantial. Cook Inlet also asserts that gaming revenues
are not subject to the same types of legal and governmental controls as other revenues received by Indian tribes, and
therefore are more analogous to the revenues of non-Indian entities. Furthermore, Congress granted the SBA (whose
rules inspired our affiliation rules) flexibility to treat tribal and other affiliations with exceptional revenues
differently if such revenues would create an ``unfair competitive advantage.''
<FOOTCITE>22</FOOTCITE>
 Gaming revenues generated by tribal organizations, appear to be exceptional revenues that if not included, create
an unfair competitive advantage in the auctioning of broadband PCS entrepreneurs' block licenses. Thus, we will
include such gaming revenues in our calculations when determining eligibility for the entrepreneurs' block and
for small business status, unless the entrepreneurs' block applicant establishes that it will not receive an unfair
competitive advantage, because significant legal constraints restrict its ability (or an affiliate's ability)
to access and utilize revenues from gaming.

Section 7(j)(10)(J) of the Small Business Act gives the SBA the discretion to consider tribal and other affiliations

45. Finally, we decline to create an exception to our affiliation rules for rural telephone companies. We are concerned
that relaxing our rules would unfairly match large rural telephone companies, with greater access to capital, against
entrepreneurs and designated entities (including small and medium-sized rural telephone companies). We note in
this regard, that rural telephone companies already enjoy substantial regulatory benefits (
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
e.g., 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
access to Rural Electrification Administration loans) affecting available capital in comparison to other designated
entities. Moreover, we observe that rural telephone companies will be permitted to acquire partitioned licenses
at any time after the close of auctions. We believe that existing measures will thereby achieve our goal of facilitating
the rapid deployment of PCS to rural areas. At MEANS/SDN's request, however, we clarify that a centralized equal access
provider (
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
i.e., 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
a group of rural telephone companies that provide centralized equal access and other sophisticated information
services)
<FOOTCITE>23</FOOTCITE>
 will not be deemed an affiliate of each of its constituent members. Based on the record, it does not appear that such
entities control their constituent members or that each of the members control the centralized equal access providers.
Thus, for example, if two or more of MEANS' members form a consortium of small businesses that apply for the entrepreneurs'
blocks, MEANS itself would not be attributed to each one of the small businesses. We agree with MEANS that this clarification
will contribute to the efficient deployment of broadband PCS in rural areas.

47. Karl Brothers requests that the Commission amend its definition of ``members of minority groups'' to include
businesses owned by individuals with disabilities. Specifically, Karl Brothers suggest the Commission adopt the
standard established in the SBA Section 8(a) program to determine who should qualify for designated entity status.
According to Karl Brothers, this SBA program includes businesses owned by disabled individuals under a ``means''
and ``socially disadvantaged'' test. Karl Brothers maintains that the congressional mandate to give special preference
to minority groups is not limited to just ethnic minorities, but should include other historically disadvantaged
minorities. Karl Brothers maintains that Congress was merely giving examples of groups to be included in the definition
of minorities, not limiting the definition to ethnic groups only. Karl Brothers contends that there is no statutory
language excluding other disadvantaged groups.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
48. After considering Karl Brothers' request, we will not include persons with disabilities in the definition of
minorities for purposes of bidding on the entrepreneurs' blocks and obtaining the special provisions available
to minority applicants. The record in this proceeding does not contain any evidence that demonstrates that firms
owned by persons with disabilities have more difficulty accessing capital than any other small business. In this
respect, the record of this proceeding on the difficulties that minorities, women and small businesses, in general,
have experienced accessing capital strongly supports the special provisions we adopted for these groups. Moreover,
individuals with disabilities are not expressly named as a designated entity in Section 309(j)(4)(D) of the Communications
Act, and there is no indication in the legislative record of the statute that Congress intended to expand this group
of beneficiaries to include any group or individual that can demonstrate that it is ``socially disadvantaged'' similar
to the SBA Section 8(a) approach described by the Karl Brothers. Unlike the Small Business Act, Section 309(j)(4)(D)
of the Communications Act does not contain the term ``socially disadvantaged.''

8(a) status for minority groups (which are defined in racial and ethnic terms), but firms owned by persons with disabilities
must demonstrate that they are ``socially disadvantaged'' in order to gain entry into the program. Also, the SBA's
denial of Section 8(a) status for firms owned by persons with disabilities where such ``social disadvantage'' has
not been established, has been upheld in court.
