Hawaii longline limited entry permits would be required for longline vessels used to: (1) Fish for pelagic species
in the EEZ around Hawaii; or (2) land or transship pelagic species shoreward of the outer boundary of the EEZ around
Hawaii. The permits already required by existing regulations at 50 CFR 685.9 would be re-named ``longline general
permits'' and would be required for longline vessels around American Samoa, Guam, the Northern Mariana Islands or
other U.S. possessions in the Pacific Ocean, that are used to fish for, land, or transship pelagic species. Holders
of Hawaii longline limited entry permits would not need a separate general permit to longline, land, or transship
anywhere in the fishery management area (the waters off Hawaii and all the western Pacific territories and possessions),
or adjacent state waters. Receiving vessel permits would be required for vessels shoreward of the outer boundary
of the fishery management area that do not have longline gear on board and that land pelagic species or receive pelagic
species from other vessels. For purposes of 50 CFR part 685, ``land'' means to begin to offload, to arrive in port with
the intention of offloading, or to cause to be offloaded. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The following persons would be eligible for Hawaii longline limited entry permits: 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(1) The last holder of record for any longline vessel limited entry permit under the moratorium, provided the vessel
was used to land longline-caught management unit species in Hawaii at least once during the moratorium period; (2)
The last holder of record of a limited entry permit under the moratorium for a vessel less than 40 feet (12 m) in length;
and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(3) The last holder of record of a limited entry permit obtained during the moratorium because that person also held
a limited entry permit for the NWHI crustaceans (lobster) fishery. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Approximately 166 vessels are expected to qualify for permits under this program. Hawaii longline limited entry
permits would be freely transferable between vessel owners, provided the new vessel is not longer than the longest
vessel that had a longline limited entry permit and made landings during the moratorium period (about 93 feet (28 m)
to date). The vessel's length overall is defined in the proposed regulations and will be the measure of length used
in implementing this restriction. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
These measures are intended to allow vessel owners more freedom to either transfer their vessels or permits to other
prospective fishery participants or invest in larger vessels (up to the size of the largest vessel active in the moratorium
period) in order to resume operation in the fishery. Vessel owners would have more freedom to decide whether and how
to use their vessels and other resources. This is expected to result in a decrease in the number of smaller vessels and
an increase in the number of larger vessels. Overall effort is expected to increase over the actual effort that occurred
during the moratorium, with more effort directed at swordfish on the high seas. Landings of swordfish and tuna are
expected to increase, with the value of landings estimated to rise from about $45 million in 1992 to about $60 million
per year after fleet adjustments have been made. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The amendment contains framework procedures to allow rapid responses to changing conditions, including biological
concerns for the stocks, economic problems in the fisheries, and potential harm to protected species under the Endangered
Species Act, such as sea turtles. This would simplify the implementation of needed changes in the management program.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Non-permitted U.S. longline vessels could enter the exclusive economic zone (EEZ) in the Council's area of concern
and ports shoreward of the EEZ with longline-caught fish on board provided the longline gear is stowed or secured.
These vessels would not be allowed to offload management unit species shoreward of the outer boundary of the EEZ. These
measures are intended to relieve economic strains now faced by longline vessel owners in Hawaii due to present limitations
on permit transfers and vessel upgrades. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Section 685.23 would be removed because the 5-year review was completed in 1992 and this section is therefore no longer
applicable. It was noted that pelagic fisheries had changed dramatically and that more frequent evaluation of the
effectiveness of management was necessary. Several amendments to the FMP already had been implemented to address
new issues. The Council now prepares an annual report on this fishery under the FMP. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
This rule also proposes to add three fish species to the management unit (moonfish,

spp.; pomfret, Family Bramidae; and oilfish, Family Gempylidae). The definition of overfishing applied to other
Pacific Pelagic Management Unit Species (excluding sharks) would apply to the species added to the management unit.
This would ensure that collection of catch and effort data will be comprehensive. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In addition, the definition of protected species zone would be revised to correct a drafting error when the zone was
created 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(56 FR 52214, October 18, 1991). The current definition leaves open to longline fishing a corridor between Laysan
Island and Lisianski Island. The intent of the Council in establishing the protected species zone was to provide a
continuous closed corridor around the NWHI in which longline fishing would be prohibited to protect Hawaiian monk
seals. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The rule would eliminate &sect;685.26, which has procedures for changing longline fishing prohibited areas, because
the new framework procedures in &sect;685.18 would encompass the procedures for changing longline fishing prohibited
areas.
