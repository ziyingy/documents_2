The availability of commercial treatment capacity for these 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
wastes determines whether or not a waste is granted a capacity 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
variance under RCRA Section 3004(h). EPA continues to update and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
monitor changes in available commercial treatment capacity 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
because the commercial hazardous waste management industry is 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
extremely dynamic. For example, national commercial treatment 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
capacity changes as new facilities come on-line, as new units and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
new technologies are added at existing facilities, and as 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
facilities expand existing units. The available capacity at 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
commercial facilities also changes as facilities change their 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
commercial status (
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
e.g.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
, changing from a fully commercial to a 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
limited commercial or captive facility). To determine the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
availability of capacity for treating these wastes, the Agency 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
needs to consider currently available data, as well as the timing 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
of any future changes in available capacity. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
For previous land disposal restriction rules, the Agency 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
performed capacity analyses using data from national surveys, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
including the 1987 National Survey of Hazardous Waste Treatment, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Storage, Disposal, and Recycling Facilities (the TSDR Survey) and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the 1987 National Survey of Hazardous Waste Generators (the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Generator Survey). However, these surveys cannot be used to 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
determine the volumes of dye and pigment wastes requiring 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
treatment since these wastes were not included in the surveys. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Additionally, these surveys may not contain adequate information 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
on currently available capacity to treat newly identified wastes 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
because the data reflect 1986 capacity and do not include 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
facility expansions or closures that have occurred since then. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Although adjustments have been made to commercially available 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
capacity to account for changes in waste management through 1992, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
this was not done on a consistent basis across all waste 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
management practices. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
EPA gathered data on waste generation, characteristics and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
management practices for the listing determination of dye and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
pigment wastes in the RCRA Section 3007 Questionnaire of 1991. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Agency has compiled the capacity-related information from the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
survey responses and is soliciting any updated or additional 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
pertinent information. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
To perform the necessary capacity analyses in the land 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
disposal restrictions rulemaking, the Agency needs reliable data 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
on current waste generation, waste management practices, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
available alternative treatment capacity, and planned treatment 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
capacity. The Agency will need the annual generation volumes of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
waste by each waste code including wastewater and nonwastewater 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
forms, and soil or debris contaminated with these wastes and the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
quantities stored, treated, recycled, or disposed due to any 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
change of management practices. EPA also requests data from 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
facilities capable of treating these wastes on their current 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
treatment capacity and any plans they may have in the future to 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
expand or reduce existing capacity. Specifically, the Agency 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
requests information on the determining factors involved in 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
making decisions to build new treatment capacity. Waste 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
characteristics such as pH level, BTUs, anionic character, total 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
organic carbon content, constituents concentration, and physical 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
form also may limit the availability of certain treatment 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
technologies. For these reasons, the Agency requests data and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
comments on waste characteristics that might limit or preclude 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the use of any treatment technologies.

V. Compliance Dates 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 -->
A. Notification 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Under RCRA Section 3010, any person generating, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
transporting, or managing a hazardous waste must notify EPA (or 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
an authorized State) of its activities. Section 3010(a) allows 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
EPA to waive, under certain circumstances, the notification 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
requirement under Section 3010 of RCRA. If these hazardous waste 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
listings are promulgated, EPA is proposing to waive the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
notification requirement as unnecessary for persons already 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
identified within the hazardous waste management universe (
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
i.e.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
persons who have an EPA identification number under 40 CFR 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
262.12). EPA is not proposing to waive the notification 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
requirement for waste handlers who have neither notified the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Agency that they may manage hazardous wastes nor received an EPA 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
identification number. Such individuals will have to provide 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
notification under RCRA Section 3010.

B. Interim Status and Permitted Facilities 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Because HSWA requirements are applicable in authorized 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
States at the same time as in unauthorized States, EPA will 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
regulate EPA Hazardous Wastes Nos. K162 through K166 until States 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
are authorized to regulate these wastes. Thus, once this 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
regulation becomes effective as a final rule, EPA will apply 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Federal regulations to these wastes and to their management in 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
both authorized and unauthorized States.

A. Applicability of Rule in Authorized States 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Under Section 3006 of RCRA, EPA may authorize qualified 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
States to administer and enforce the RCRA program within the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
State. (See 40 CFR part 271 for the standards and requirements 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
for authorization.) Following authorization, EPA retains 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
enforcement authority under Sections 3007, 3008, 3013, and 7003 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
of RCRA, although authorized States have primary enforcement 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
responsibility. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Before the Hazardous and Solid Waste Amendments of 1984 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(HSWA) amended RCRA, a State with final authorization 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
administered its hazardous waste program entirely in lieu of the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Federal program in that State. The Federal requirements no 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
longer applied in the authorized State, and EPA could not issue 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
permits for any facilities located in the State with permitting 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
authorization. When new, more stringent Federal requirements 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
were promulgated or enacted, the State was obligated to enact 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
equivalent authority within specified time-frames. New Federal 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
requirements did not take effect in an authorized State until the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
State adopted the requirements as State law.
