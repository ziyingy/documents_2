(a) An Exchange Designated Dealer (``specialist'') must establish a functional separation (``Chinese Wall'')

establish, maintain and enforce written procedures reasonably designed to prevent the misuse of material, non-public
information, which includes review of employee and proprietary trading, memorialization and documentation of
procedures, substantive supervision of inter-departmental communications by the Exchange specialist firm's
Compliance Department and procedures concerning proprietary trading when the firm is in possession of material,
non-public information. The Exchange specialist firm must obtain the prior written approval of the Exchange that
it has complied with the requirements above in establishing functional separation as appropriate to the operation
and that it has established proper compliance and audit procedures to ensure the maintenance of the functional separation.
A copy of these Chinese Wall procedures, and any amendments thereto, must be filed with the Exchange's Surveillance
Department.

and affiliated or associated specialists in the specialist firms' specialty stocks in order to monitor the possible
trading while in possession of material, non-public information through the periodic review of trade and comparison
