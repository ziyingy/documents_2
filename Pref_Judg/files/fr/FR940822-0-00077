SUMMARY:
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
 The Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA) is issuing technical amendments to existing Appendix
B and is adding a new non-mandatory Appendix E to both 29 CFR 1910.120, 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=3 -->
Hazardous Waste Operations and Emergency Response
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
 and 29 CFR 1926.65, 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=3 -->
Hazardous Waste Operations and Emergency Response
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
. The technical amendments to the Appendix B involve the updating of certain reference sources listed in Appendix
B to both 29 CFR 1910.120 and 1910.65. The new Appendix E provides suggested guidelines for a more effective training
curriculum and program. The mandatory requirements for those training programs are set forth in the main body of 29
CFR 1910.120 and 1926.65. The addition of a non-mandatory Appendix E to these sections will provide supplementary
information that can be used by employers for training program development directed toward training those employees
engaged in hazardous waste operations and emergency response activities within the scope of 29 CFR 1910.120 or 1926.65.

Regulatory history
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
. On October 17, 1986, former President Reagan signed into law the Superfund Amendments and Reauthorization Act of
1986 (SARA) (Pub. L. 99&hyph;499). As part of SARA, the Secretary of Labor (the Secretary) was directed to issue an
interim final rule within 60 days after the date of enactment of SARA, which was to provide not less protection for employees
engaged in covered hazardous waste operations than the protection contained in two specified documents. Those two
documents were the Environmental Protection Agency's (EPA) ``Health and Safety Requirements for Employees Engaged
in Field Activities'' manual (EPA ORDER 1440.2), dated 1981, and the existing Occupational Safety and Health Administration
(OSHA) standards under Subpart C or 29 CFR part 1926, OSHA's Construction Industry Safety and Health Standards. OSHA
published an interim final rule as directed in the 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 -->
Federal Register
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 on December 19, 1986 (51 FR 45654). 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In section 126 of SARA, the Congress also directed the Secretary to issue, within one year after the date of enactment
of SARA, a final standard under section 6(b) of the Occupational Safety and Health Act of 1970 for the health and safety
of employers engaged in hazardous waste operations and emergency response. SARA also indicated that certain specific
areas of employee protection, in particular employee training, were relevant to protect employees engaged in hazardous
waste operations.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
OSHA issued a proposed rule on hazardous waste operations and emergency including provisions for training on August
10, 1987 (52 FR 29620). Public hearings on the proposed rule were held during October 1987. As a result of that proposed
rule OSHA published a permanent final rule for hazardous waste operations and emergency response (HAZWOPER) on March
6, 1989 (54 FR 9294). That permanent final rule became effective on March 6, 1990.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In related action, on December 22, 1987, as part of an omnibus budget reconciliation bill (Pub. L. 100&hyph;202),
the language of SARA was amended. The amendment addressed section 126(d)(3) of SARA. Section 126(d)(3) of SARA reads
as follows before the amendment:

The amendment to section 126(d)(3) contained in Pub. L. 100-202 added the following language to the end of paragraph

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG QTAG 04 -->
<!-- PJG /QTAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->
That section 126(d)(3) of SARA is amended by adding a new sentence at the end thereof as follows: The certification
procedures shall be no less comprehensive than those adopted by the Environmental Protection Agency in its Model
Accreditation Plan for Asbestos Abatement Training as required under the Asbestos Hazard Emergency Response Act
of 1986.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
In response to the amendment, OSHA on January 26, 1990, issued a Notice of Proposed Rulemaking (NPRM) (55 FR 2776) addressing
the accreditation of training programs for hazardous waste operations.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Since January, 1990, OSHA has been working to develop a final rule addressing the accreditation of certain training
programs required in 29 CFR 1910.120 and 29 CFR 1926.65. OSHA will complete shortly action on that final rule.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
On June 30, 1992, OSHA republished 29 CFR 1910.120 in 29 CFR Part 1926 as 1926.65 at the request of the OSHA Advisory Committee
on Construction Safety and Health (ACCSH). This republication codified most of the requirements affecting construction
activities in one part of the CFR for the convenience of construction industry employers and employees.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The most recent action on this rule concerns the development of the non-mandatory appendix to be added as Appendix
E to 1910.120. This action took place during the September 30, 1993 meeting of ACCSH held in Washington, DC. As part
of the Advisory Committee's action, a work group chaired by Mr. John Moran, Director of Safety and Health for the Laborers'
Health and Safety Fund made specific recommendations to the full advisory committee concerning OSHA's proposed
29 CFR 1910.121 rulemaking. The first recommendation of the work group was, ``that OSHA promptly issue a non-mandatory
appendix to 1910.120, establishing minimum training curriculum guidelines and minimum training provider guidelines
(ACCSH Tr. pg. 148, lines 22&hyph;25).'' Mr. Moran made a formal motion that the ACCSH recommend, ``the prompt issuance
of a non-mandatory appendix to 1910.120 which contains guidelines for minimum training curriculum, and that minimum
training provider requirements to meet the training standards established in 120 (ACCSH Tr. pg. 152, lines 5&hyph;10).''
The motion was passed unanimously (ACCSH Tr. pg. 159, lines 3&hyph;11). The formal report containing the recommendations
developed by the work group was presented to the Assistant Secretary by the ACCSH on October 1, 1993.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The report included a December, 1991 document titled, ``
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Minimum Criteria for Worker Health and Safety Training for Hazardous Waste Operations and Emergency Response
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
.'' The National Institute of Environmental Health Sciences (NIEHS) Training Grant Technical Workshop on Training
Quality developed the document during a technical workshop on training quality. The workshop, ``Minimum Criteria
for Worker Health and Safety Training for Hazardous Waste Operations and Emergency Response was held March 22&hyph;24,
1990 in Washington, DC and was sponsored by NIEHS. Approximately 60 individuals from labor, industry and the government,
including representatives from OSHA participated in the workshop.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The report recommends that,
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->
OSHA should promptly issue a non-mandatory appendix to 29 CFR 1910.120 which provides guidelines as to minimum training
curriculum and training provider requirements for those training activities mandated by the 1910.120 standard.
It is our recommendation that this appendix be essentially the NIEHS National Technical Workshop consensus document
referred to in the BACKGROUND above and which is appended to this report.&blank;

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
</FOOTNOTE>

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The ACCSH recommendation to the Assistant Secretary suggested that the non-mandatory appendix address two topics.
First, ACCSH recommended that the appendix should provide guidelines as to the minimum training curriculum for those
training activities mandated by 1910.120. Second, ACCSH recommended that the appendix should provide guidelines
as to the minimum training provider requirements for those training activities mandated by 1910.120.

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Non-mandatory Appendix E on Training
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
. Separate from the ACCSH recommendations, several individuals suggested that during the interim period prior to
issuing a final rule on training accreditation, OSHA should add a non-mandatory appendix to 29 CFR 1910.120 and 29
CFR 1926.65 that would provide guidance to employers for developing effective training programs. The training provisions
of these two standards are stated in performance oriented language in paragraph (e) for hazardous waste site workers,
in paragraph (p)(7) for treatment, storage, and disposal facility workers, and in paragraph (q)(6) for emergency
response workers. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
OSHA uses non-mandatory appendices for a number of purposes such as to provide non-regulatory guidance to employees
and employers for the purpose of complying with various OSHA regulations or to assist them in developing more effective
safety and health operations. They may also be an amplification of interpretive information that is included in the
preamble discussions of rulemakings when they are published in the 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 -->
Federal Register.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
It is often brought to OSHA's attention that the useful interpretive information included in preamble discussions
addressing OSHA's standards becomes less accessible when rules and regulations are published later in the Code of
Federal Regulations. It has been suggested that having the most important of this type of information available in
the same publication as the codified text of a rule would make compliance decision making in the workplace easier.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Also non-mandatory appendices provide a non-regulatory mechanism to keep employer and employee populations aware
of new technical information that becomes available to the agency subsequent to the issuance of a standard. These
new technologies and new types of information may be of assistance to employer and employee populations in complying
with the regulatory text to which the appendix is attached.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Training provider criteria
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
. OSHA has reviewed the training provider criteria suggested in the ``
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Minimum Criteria for Worker Health and Safety Training for Hazardous Waste Operations and Emergency Response
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
.'' OSHA is considering fully the issue in the final rule on certification of training programs. Consequently there
is no need to insert a non-mandatory appendix on this subject. In the interim, OSHA believes that the standard provides
sufficient guidance on the qualifications of instructors and that additional information in an appendix format
is unnecessary.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Training curriculum guidelines
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
. The document that the ACCSH recommended that OSHA use as the training guidelines to be placed in the non-mandatory
appendix is titled, ``
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Minimum Criteria for Worker Health and Safety Training for Hazardous Waste Operations and Emergency Response
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
.'' It was developed to report the results of a technical workshop on training quality held March 22&hyph;24, 1990
in Washington, DC. The meeting was sponsored by the National Institute of Environmental Health Sciences (NIEHS).
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
NIEHS employee training program grantees identified a need to establish criteria for determining the quality of
employee health and safety training programs. This was believed by the workshop to be especially critical for meeting
the training requirements of the Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA) rule for hazardous waste
operations and emergency response (29 CFR 1910.120). The NIEHS employee training program grantees planned a workshop
to identify, evaluate, discuss and make recommendations on training quality issues in this area. A planning committee
met twice to develop a draft discussion document for the workshop's deliberations. The workshop brought together
representatives from each of the NIEHS grantees, and invited experts from management, labor, academia, and government.
A balance of such representations was sought for each of the workshop's five sub-sessions. The sub-sessions topics
included the following:
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
1. General Criteria.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
2. General hazardous waste operations and site-specific training.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
3. RCRA-treatment, storage, and disposal (TSD) sites.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
4. Emergency response.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
5. Guidelines for accreditation.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
At the closing plenary, a draft final report from the workshop was sent out for a review by participants. Comments offered
during the closing plenary and for a period after the meeting were received and included as appropriate in the final
document. The report represents the views of the technical experts rather than an official position by any agency,
including NIEHS.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
NIEHS is authorized under the Superfund Amendments and Reauthorization Act of 1986 (SARA) to award grants to nonprofit
organizations that demonstrate experience in implementing and operating employee health and safety training and
education programs and that demonstrate the ability to reach and involve in training programs target populations
ow employees who are or will be engaged in hazardous materials waste removal, containment, or emergency response
operations. The grantees who attended the conference met the requirements of and participation in the NIEHS program.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
OSHA has reviewed the guidelines. Overall they would lead to a highly effective training program. Following them
would certainly meet the training requirements of 1910.120 and 1926.65 as a general matter. The detailed guidance
they present would be helpful to trainers and employers and would lead to better training of employees. Accordingly
OSHA is publishing them as a non-mandatory Appendix E to those standards.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
However, the legal requirements are set forth in the body of the standards. These require site-specific elements
that of course can not be covered in general guidelines. In addition, some of the guidelines go beyond the clear requirements
of the regulatory text in paragraphs (a) to (q). In those cases, employers would only be cited if the employee's training
did not meet the requirements of paragraphs (a) through (q). Accordingly, Appendix E is not called ``minimum criteria''
as ACCSH entitled them. In addition, there are other training curriculum resources available that can provide additional
guidance to individuals preparing training programs. Therefore, these appendices are not only based upon the NIEHS
document but also upon other training program guidance documents. OSHA has utilized documents developed by the National
Fire Protection Association, the International Association of Fire Service Instructors, and others to supplement
the guidance provided in the NIEHS document.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Technical Amendments to Appendix B
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
. It has been brought to the attention of OSHA that certain references made to National Fire Protection Association
standards in Appendix B to 1910.120 and 1926.65 are outdated. OSHA makes reference to NFPA 1991, NFPA 1992, and NFPA
1993 as standards that were under development at the time 29 CFR 1910.120 was published. These references are outdated
because the NFPA standards referred to in the existing text are no longer ``under development'' but were published
in 1990 as voluntary consensus standards by NFPA.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The revisions to Appendix B of 1910.120 and Appendix B of 1926.65 that are contained in this notice recognize the adoption
of these NFPA standards. The revisions correct editorially the text of these appendices to recognize the current
status of the referenced NFPA standards.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
This document makes technical amendments and adds a non-mandatory appendix for informational purposes that do not
change regulatory requirements. Accordingly, the agency finds that notice and comments are unnecessary pursuant
to the Administrative Procedures Act, 5 U.S.C. 553(b) and according to OSHA procedural rules in 29 CFR 1911.5.

C. Emergency response training.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Federal OSHA standards in 29 CFR 1910.120(q) are directed toward private sector emergency responders. Therefore,
the guidelines provided in this portion of the appendix are directed toward that employee population. However, they
also impact indirectly through State OSHA or USEPA regulations some public sector emergency responders. Therefore,
the guidelines provided in this portion of the appendix may be applied to both employee populations.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
States with OSHA state plans must cover their employees with regulations at least as effective as the Federal OSHA
standards. Public employees in states without approved state OSHA programs covering hazardous waste operations
and emergency response are covered by the U.S. EPA under 40 CFR 311, a regulation virtually identical to 1910.120.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Since this is a non-mandatory appendix and therefore not an enforceable standard, OSHA recommends that those employers,
employees or volunteers in public sector emergency response organizations outside Federal OSHA jurisdiction consider
the following criteria in developing their own training programs. A unified approach to training at the community
level between emergency response organizations covered by Federal OSHA and those not covered directly by Federal
OSHA can help ensure an effective community response to the release or potential release of hazardous substances
in the community.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
a. General considerations
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->
.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Emergency response organizations are required to consider the topics listed in 1910.120(q)(6). Emergency response
organizations may use some or all of the following topics to supplement those mandatory topics when developing their
response training programs. Many of the topics would require an interaction between the response provider and the
individuals responsible for the site where the response would be expected.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(1) Hazard recognition, including:
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(A) Nature of hazardous substances present,
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(B) Practical applications of hazard recognition, including presentations on biology, chemistry, and physics.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

Incident commander
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->
.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The incident commander is the individual who, at any one time, is responsible for and in control of the response effort.
This individual is the person responsible for the direction and coordination of the response effort. An incident
commander's position should be occupied by the most senior, appropriately trained individual present at the response
site. Yet, as necessary and appropriate by the level of response provided, the position may be occupied by many individuals
during a particular response as the need for greater authority, responsibility, or training increases. It is possible
for the first responder at the awareness level to assume the duties of incident commander until a more senior and appropriately
trained individual arrives at the response site.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Therefore, any emergency responder expected to perform as an incident commander should be trained to fulfill the
obligations of the position at the level of response they will be providing including the following:
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(A) Ability to analyze a hazardous substance incident to determine the magnitude of the response problem.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(B) Ability to plan and implement an appropriate response plan within the capabilities of available personnel and
equipment.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(C) Ability to implement a response to favorably change the outcome of the incident in a manner consistent with the
local emergency response plan and the organization's standard operating procedures.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(D) Ability to evaluate the progress of the emergency response to ensure that the response objectives are being met
safely, effectively, and efficiently.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(E) Ability to adjust the response plan to the conditions of the response and to notify higher levels of response when
required by the changes to the response plan.

C. Emergency response training.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Federal OSHA standards in 29 CFR 1926.65(q) are directed toward private sector emergency responders. Therefore,
the guidelines provided in this portion of the appendix are directed toward that employee population. However, they
also impact indirectly through State OSHA or USEPA regulations some public sector emergency responders. Therefore,
the guidelines provided in this portion of the appendix may be applied to both employee populations.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
States with OSHA state plans must cover their employees with regulations at least as effective as the Federal OSHA
standards. Public employees in states without approved state OSHA programs covering hazardous waste operations
and emergency response are covered by the U.S. EPA under 40 CFR 311, a regulation virtually identical to 1926.65.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Since this is a non-mandatory appendix and therefore not an enforceable standard, OSHA recommends that those employers,
employees or volunteers in public sector emergency response organizations outside Federal OSHA jurisdiction consider
the following criteria in developing their own training programs. A unified approach to training at the community
level between emergency response organizations covered by Federal OSHA and those not covered directly by Federal
OSHA can help ensure an effective community response to the release or potential release of hazardous substances
in the community.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
a. General considerations
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->
.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Emergency response organizations are required to consider the topics listed in 1926.65(q)(6). Emergency response
organizations may use some or all of the following topics to supplement those mandatory topics when developing their
response training programs. Many of the topics would require an interaction between the response provider and the
individuals responsible for the site where the response would be expected.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(1) Hazard recognition, including:
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(A) Nature of hazardous substances present,
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(B) Practical applications of hazard recognition, including presentations on biology, chemistry, and physics.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

Incident commander
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->
.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The incident commander is the individual who, at any one time, is responsible for and in control of the response effort.
This individual is the person responsible for the direction and coordination of the response effort. An incident
commander's position should be occupied by the most senior, appropriately trained individual present at the response
site. Yet, as necessary and appropriate by the level of response provided, the position may be occupied by many individuals
during a particular response as the need for greater authority, responsibility, or training increases. It is possible
for the first responder at the awareness level to assume the duties of incident commander until a more senior and appropriately
trained individual arrives at the response site.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Therefore, any emergency responder expected to perform as an incident commander should be trained to fulfill the
obligations of the position at the level of response they will be providing including the following:
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(A) Ability to analyze a hazardous substance incident to determine the magnitude of the response problem.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(B) Ability to plan and implement an appropriate response plan within the capabilities of available personnel and
equipment.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(C) Ability to implement a response to favorably change the outcome of the incident in a manner consistent with the
local emergency response plan and the organization's standard operating procedures.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(D) Ability to evaluate the progress of the emergency response to ensure that the response objectives are being met
safely, effectively, and efficiently.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(E) Ability to adjust the response plan to the conditions of the response and to notify higher levels of response when
required by the changes to the response plan.
