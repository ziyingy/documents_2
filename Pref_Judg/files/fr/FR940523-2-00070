The Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has informed OHTA that in May 1988 a manufacturer received premarket approval
for a salivation electrostimulator device based upon submission20 of engineering, preclinical, and clinical studies
and the recommendation of the Dental Devices Panel, FDA's Center for Devices and Radiological Health. The short-term
double-blind clinical study of the device was conducted at three institutions and included 40 patients using an active
device and 37 patients assigned a placebo. The work by Steller et al3 discussed in the literature review section is
part of this submission. Based on the data submitted, the FDA found an increase in saliva production from the patient
group using the active device compared with the patient group using the placebo device. Subjective improvement of
a burning sensation of the tongue was noted by 12 of 22 patients treated with the active device, and an improvement in
the ability to swallow was reported by 13 of these patients.

The manufacturer provided the FDA with a long-term clinical study of 34 patients with Sjogren's syndrome and xerostomia
that was intended to follow patients for up to 12 months. Patients were assessed by the physician for moisture (oral
examination) prior to the study and at visits on 1, 3, 6, and 12 months following stimulation. Eleven of 12 patients
who completed 12 months of electrical stimulation were found on the last visit to have a discernible improvement in
salivary status when compared with the initial assessment. As a followup to this study, a group of 23 patients was surveyed
by the manufacturer via telephone to assess changes in quality of life after using electrical stimulation for 6&hyph;18
months. Patients indicated improvement that included increased ease of swallowing and improved dental checkups
as well as education in burning tongue sensation, sleep interruptions, and water intake.

This device is indicated for use in patients with xerostomia secondary to Sjogren's syndrome and intended to stimulate
salivary production from existing glandular tissue. Patients who show an initial response to electrostimulation
are considered to be candidates for this therapy. According to the FDA there are no contraindications associated
with the use of this device.

Medical Specialty and Clinician Responses

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->
Medical specialty groups such as The American Dental Association were unable to provide any information regarding
the electrostimulation of salivary glands.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Comments from clinicians with knowledge of or experience with electrical stimulation of salivary production are
equivocal. Some expressed the opinion that electrostimulation is a safe and effective method for the treatment of
xerostomia secondary to Sjogren's syndrome. Others suggested that the method has been inadequately tested. Some
clinicians recommended beginning electrical stimulation of the salivary glands in patients with Sjogren's syndrome
and dry mouth early in the course of the disease in order to possibly prevent, modify, or even reverse the progression
of a salivary gland atrophy. Other clinicians are not convinced that electrostimulation is more effective than other
simple, less costly stimulation techniques such as gustatory stimulation or intraoral tactile stimulation.

Summary

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->
Electrostimulation has been introduced as a technique for increasing salivary output in the treatment of patients
with xerostomia (dry mouth) secondary to Sjogren's syndrome. The procedure uses an electrostimulation device (salivation
electrostimulator) to increase salivary production from existing glandular tissue. The device delivers a low-voltage
electrical stimulus to the mouth via a probe. Patients with residual salivary tissue in the oral and pharyngeal regions
who demonstrate a decrease in the flow rate of saliva are potential candidates for this procedure.

It is estimated that more than one million people in the United States, predominantly middle-aged and elderly women,
suffer from Sjogren's syndrome. Patients with chronic xerostomia complain of a continual feeling of oral dryness
and have difficulty eating dry foods. These patients are susceptible to increased caries, oral pain, infection,
and have difficulty speaking, chewing, and swallowing.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The approach to the treatment of xerostomia in Sjogren's patients is usually determined by the level of severity of
the symptoms. Appropriate management of patients with xerostomia requires that those patients whose salivary flow
can be increased by means of sialagogues be distinguished from those patients whose salivary flow is either unaffected
or insufficiently stimulated. To alleviate some of the complications due to salivary dysfunction in those patients
who respond to stimuli, pharmocologic sialagogues as well as sialagogues that include sugarless gums, mints and
candies are prescribed in order to increase salivary flow.

Recently, electrostimulation via a hand-held stimulus probe has been introduced as a method of treatment in xerostomia
secondary to Sjogren's syndrome. From the single published study as well as data provided to the FDA, it appears that
an electrical stimulus applied to the tongue and hard palate (by a battery-operated device) may be useful in the management
of salivary hypofunction in certain patients. It appears, however, that there are insufficient data at the present
time to determine the clinical utility of electrostimulation, to evaluate the long-term clinical effectiveness
of this modality of salivary production, or to identify those xerostomic patients who would benefit from this procedure.
Also, electrostimulation is not widely accepted as an effective method of treatment for xerostomia secondary to
Sjogren's syndrome. The number of published studies is limited and other less expensive treatments are available.
Further research of electrical stimulation of salivary flow is required to determine its role in the treatment of
Sjogren's patients with xerostomia.
