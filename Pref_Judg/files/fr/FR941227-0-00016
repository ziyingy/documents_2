(a) The Rural Electrification Administration (REA) was established by Executive Order No. 7037, signed by the President
on May 11, 1935. Statutory authority was provided by the Rural Electrification Act of 1936 (RE Act) (49 Stat. 1363;
7 U.S.C. 901). The RE Act established REA as a lending agency with responsibility for developing a program for rural
electrification. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(b) On October 28, 1949, an amendment to the RE Act authorized REA to make loans to improve and extend telephone service
in rural areas. The Rural Telephone Bank (RTB or the Bank), an Agency of the United States, was established by another
amendment to the RE Act, approved May 7, 1971. The Administrator of RUS serves as the Bank's chief executive with the
title of Governor. On May 11, 1973, the RE Act was further amended to establish a revolving fund and to provide authority
for REA to guarantee loans made by other legally organized lenders. The RE Act was amended further on December 21, 1987,
to establish a Rural Economic Development Subaccount, and to authorize funds from this subaccount to provide zero-interest
loans and grants to REA borrowers to promote rural economic development and job creation. The RE Act was also amended
on November 5, 1990, to add a new section 314, which authorized REA to guarantee 90 percent of the principal and interest
of loans made for electric and telephone facilities by legally organized lenders. It was further amended on November
28, 1990, to establish an Assistant Administrator for Economic Development and a rural development technical assistance
unit; to expand the authorities and responsibilities of REA in rural economic development; and to establish a Rural
Business Incubator Fund for making grants and reduced interest loans to electric and telephone borrowers to promote
business incubator projects. At the same time, the Administrator was also granted authority for financial assistance
for distance learning and medical link programs.

(c) The Secretary of Agriculture (Secretary) was required to establish the Rural Utilities Service (RUS) pursuant
to section 232 of the Federal Crop Insurance Reform and Department of Agriculture Reorganization Act of 1994, (Pub.
L. 103&hyph;354, 108 Stat. 3178) (Reorganization Act). The Reorganization Act established RUS as successor to REA.
On October 20, 1994, the Secretary abolished REA and established RUS. RUS was assigned responsibility for administering
electric and telephone loan programs previously administered by REA, water and waste facility loans and grants previously
administered by the Rural Development Administration, along with other functions as the Secretary determines appropriate.
The rights, interests, obligations, duties, and contracts previously vested in REA are transferred to and vested
in RUS. The Secretary designated the Administrator of RUS to serve as the Governor of RTB. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(d) The offices of RUS are located in the South Building of the United States Department of Agriculture at 14th and Independence
Avenue, SW., Washington, DC 20250&hyph;1500. The Electric and Telephone Programs are administered by regional
offices located at this same address. There is a Northern and a Southern Regional Office, along with a Power Supply
Division, for the electric program, and an Eastern and a Western Regional Office for the telephone program. (See &sect;1700.4(b)
and &sect;1700.5(b).)
