Low-income families.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 Families whose incomes do not exceed 80 percent of the median income for the area, as determined by HUD with adjustments
for smaller and larger families, except that HUD may establish income ceilings higher or lower than 80 percent of the
median for the area on the basis of HUD's findings that such variations are necessary because of prevailing levels
of construction costs or fair market rents, or unusually high or low family incomes. (The CDBG program has used the
terms ``low-income'' and ``moderate-income'' persons, which terms are derived from its statute. Those terms have
the same meaning as the terms ``very low-income'' and ``low-income'' as used in NAHA and in the United States Housing
Act of 1937 for the assisted housing programs administered under it. To make the usage uniform under this part, the
terms ``very low-income'' and ``low-income'' are used here.)
