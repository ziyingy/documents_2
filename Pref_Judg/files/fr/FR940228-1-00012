III. General Discussion of Proposed Rule Changes 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The proposed amendments contain requirements which are intended to improve radiography safety. The first major
change is a proposal to require, at a minimum, two qualified individuals (two radiographers or a radiographer and
an individual who has met, at least, the requirements to be a radiographer's assistant) to be present any time radiographic
operations occur outside of a permanent radiographic installation. This issue has already been addressed under
Section II. Petition for Rulemaking.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
On March 19, 1991 (56 FR 11504), the NRC published a final rule which provided for a voluntary third-party radiographer
certification program through the American Society for Nondestructive Testing (ASNT), as discussed further in
Section IV. Several Agreement States have adopted mandatory radiographer state administered examination programs.
The promulgation of these programs, as well as other changes in their radiography regulations, have contributed
to an overall improvement in safety and a decrease in serious overexposures in these Agreement States.

The proposed rule would recognize other certifying organizations who meet the requirements outlined in Appendix
A of the proposed rule. Independent certifying organizations would be required to meet all of the requirements listed
in Appendix A, while Agreement States that wish to become certifying entities would only be required to meet the requirements
listed in part II and III of the Appendix. The NRC plans to publish annually in the

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 -->
Federal Register
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 an updated list of certifying entities and to provide the list with license application forms. The NRC also plans to
investigate the feasibility of establishing a toll-free telephone number whereby licensees could obtain information
on approved certifying entities.

Another issue involves the definition of a permanent radiographic installation. The proposed rule changes the definition
of a ``permanent radiographic installation'' to mean an enclosed shielded room, cell, or vault in which radiography
is performed. The terms ``designed or intended for radiography'' and ``regularly performed'' have been removed
from the definition to reduce any ambiguity as to what is intended. Under the existing rule, if a licensee has a room,
cell, or vault that meets the definition of a ``permanent radiographic installation'', then it must meet the special
safety requirements of &sect;34.33. The proposed rule adds two additional requirements: (1) To perform a daily check
of the visible and audible signals, and (2) to list all permanent facilities on the license. Under the proposed rule,
radiography can only be performed in one of two ways: (1) In a permanent radiographic installation with a qualified
radiographer, or (2) at any other location with at least two qualified individuals. The special safety requirements
of &sect;34.33 would not apply to the use of a shielded room at a temporary jobsite, although licensees would be permitted
to submit a license amendment requesting approval to use a shielded room which meets the requirements of &sect;34.33
as a permanent radiographic installation. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The proposed rule includes requirements specifying the qualifications and duties of the Radiation Safety Officer
(RSO). The RSO is the key licensee individual charged with the responsibility to ensure that the requirements in the
license are followed. These requirements have been based on similar commitments previously included in specific
license conditions on a case-by-case basis. The proposed rule would require additional special training for RSOs.
The Commission is considering permitting existing RSOs to obtain the additional training within 2 years from the
effective date of the rule and is specifically requesting comment on this proposed requirement.

IV. An Independent Certifying Entity (ASNT)

The current ASNT program for certifying industrial radiographers was approved by its Board of Directors in March
1990 and offers certification for either isotope or x-ray users. The NRC staff has extensively reviewed this program,
which includes a written examination developed by the State of Texas. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The application to become a certified radiographer requires documentation of 40 hours of classroom training in radiation
safety topics specified by ASNT including those topics listed in the proposed &sect;34.43(f), documentation of
520 hours of direct hands-on experience with radiography sources and devices under the control of an NRC or Agreement
State licensee, and proof of successful completion of a practical examination on safety procedures administered
by an ASNT-recognized institution. Recognized institutions, generally the candidates' employers, have been licensed
by NRC or an Agreement State for the use of radiography sources. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
After ASNT's approval of an application, a candidate radiographer takes the written examination. The examination
is administered by ASNT or the Conference of Radiation Control Program Directors, Inc. (CRCPD) and subsequently
sent to the State of Texas for grading. The results of the examination are forwarded to ASNT. The written examination
covers the fundamental radiation safety principles outlined in 10 CFR part 34, pertinent Federal and State regulations,
basic radiographic equipment operation, general operating and emergency procedures, radiation detection instrumentation,
and radiation safety procedures applicable to industrial radiography. In addition, candidates are required to
sign a pledge that they will abide by the ASNT Rules of Conduct. On successful completion of the required examinations
and other requirements, a certified individual is provided with a wallet card identifying him/her as an ASNT-certified
radiographer. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
ASNT certification is valid for 3 years, unless suspended or revoked for cause. Renewal of certification may be accomplished
either with or without reexamination. A candidate for renewal without reexamination must document continuous active
full-time employment in radiography for at least 6 of the last 12 months. In addition, the candidate must document
at least 8 hours, each year, of classroom refresher training covering basic radiation safety principles, equipment
operations, emergency procedures, new safety regulations, license requirements, and other pertinent information.
If these criteria are not met, the candidate must retake the written examination. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The ASNT Rules of Conduct require certified individuals to comply with NRC and Agreement State regulations and the
employer's procedures for radiation safety, routine and emergency operations, and to act in a professional manner
in matters pertaining to industrial radiography or to the ASNT certification. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The certification program also contains complaint and hearing procedures. For example, written allegations of
unauthorized practice by an ASNT-certified individual are reviewed by the ASNT Ethics Subcommittee. In some cases
a formal hearing may be held. If the ASNT Ethics Subcommittee determines that an unauthorized practice has been committed,
the subcommittee may take one of the following actions:
