2. Purpose
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
: To build the capacity of State, local, Tribal, and other publicly administered or publicly supported child welfare
agencies in the development, expansion, strengthening and/or improvement of the quality and effectiveness of child
welfare services to children, youth and families in a number of critical areas. The National Resource Centers for
Child Welfare Services Programs will strengthen agencies' capacity to integrate policy and practice as well as develop
and implement policy frameworks which support quality practice. The National Resource Centers for Child Welfare
Services Programs will build capacity primarily through delivering on-site training, technical assistance, and
consultation to publicly administered or publicly supported child welfare agencies. They will also engage in ancillary
activities which support the delivery of training and technical assistance. Training and technical assistance
needs will be identified in collaboration with ACYF Central and Regional Office personnel and State agency staff.

3. Background
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
: A period of great promise and significant opportunity has emerged for child welfare. The Omnibus Budget Reconciliation
Act of 1993 established a new Subpart 2 of Title IV&hyph;B of the Social Security Act, entitled Family Preservation
and Support Services, which is capable of stimulating meaningful change in child welfare systems and fostering more
effective working relationships among Federal, State and local governments, other direct service providers, foundations
and advocacy groups around child welfare matters.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Federal government is in the process of redefining its relationship with State and other child welfare agencies.
A new partnership is being forged based upon a vision wherein all concerned agencies will collaborate and cooperate
to provide a continuum of services to meet the needs of vulnerable children, youth and families. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Even though the capped entitlement funding to States from the Family Preservation and Support Program is relatively
modest, there is widespread agreement within the child and family policy community that the funds can be used best
in a creative and strategic fashion to stimulate and encourage broader system reform which is already underway in
many States and communities. Because the multiple needs of vulnerable children and families cannot be adequately
addressed through categorical programs and fragmented service delivery systems, States are being encouraged to
use the new funds to help establish a continuum of coordinated and integrated, culturally relevant, family-centered
services for children and families. Specifically, States are being asked to conduct a broad-based and inclusive
planning process with their FY 1994 Family Preservation and Family Support allocation leading to the development
of a five-year State Plan for child welfare, including family preservation and support services, beginning in FY
1995.
