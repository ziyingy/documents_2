SUMMARY:
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
 The Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA) is revising portions of the general industry safety standards
addressing personal protective equipment (PPE). The standards being revised include those containing general
requirements for all PPE (1910.132) and standards that set design, selection, and use requirements for specific
types of PPE (eye, face, head, foot and hand). 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 The Agency is updating the standards for PPE to be more consistent with the current consensus regarding good industry
practices, as reflected by the latest editions of the pertinent American National Standards Institute (ANSI) standards.
The revision will provide guidance for the selection and use of PPE as well as clearer requirements that are performance-oriented,
where appropriate. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
 New paragraphs (d), (e), and (f) (containing requirements covering equipment selection, defective and damaged
equipment, and training, respectively) have been added to 1910.132. Also, a new section (1910.138) has been added
to this Subpart to address hazards to the hands. Non-mandatory appendices A and B have also been added to this Subpart
to provide additional guidance to employers and employees with regard to PPE for eye, face, head, foot, and hand hazards.

I. Background 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=2 -->
The existing OSHA standards for personal protective equipment (PPE) are contained in Subpart I of OSHA's general
industry standards. These standards were adopted in 1971 from established Federal standards and national consensus
standards. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In developing a proposed revision of Subpart I, the Agency performed a comprehensive review of the PPE standards.
This review revealed several limitations and concerns with respect to these standards. First, OSHA determined that
many of the existing PPE standards were outdated since they reflected knowledge and practices regarding PPE as they
existed in the late 1960's and early 1970's. This meant that employers were being required to explain how compliance
with more recent editions of the pertinent consensus standards provides equivalent protection to that provided
by the older editions in the OSHA standards. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Second, the Agency determined that there were certain gaps in coverage of the PPE standards, and that the standards
set very restrictive design criteria which might limit the use of new technology. OSHA was concerned that restraints
on innovation might also make it more difficult for employers either to increase acceptance of PPE, or to provide more
protective PPE. Recognizing this situation, the Agency established a process under which OSHA has accepted, for
example, on a case-by-case basis, the use of eye protection which, while not designed to meet the specifications in
the existing standards, had been demonstrated to provide equivalent or superior worker protection. The Agency determined,
however, that this process could not keep pace with the development of improved PPE. Consequently, OSHA was concerned
that, unless the PPE standards were revised to be more performance-oriented, employers and product manufacturers
might be discouraged from improving their equipment and from providing improved protection to workers. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Also, OSHA had obtained injury data and technical reports which showed that injuries were occurring to employees
who were wearing PPE as well as to those employees who were not wearing PPE. This indicated that, in some cases, significant
improvements in PPE design and acceptance might be needed. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Based on these concerns, OSHA developed a proposed revision to its PPE standards. The proposed revision was published
in the 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 -->
Federal Register
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 as a notice of proposed rulemaking (NPRM) on August 16, 1989 (54 FR 33832). OSHA proposed to revise the safety standards
for eye and face protection (1910.133); head protection (1910.135); and foot protection (1910.136) by referencing
the latest editions of the corresponding standards published by the American National Standards Institute (ANSI).
The provisions of existing 1910.134 and 1910.137 (which cover respiratory protection and electrical protective
devices, respectively) are the subjects of separate rulemaking actions and are not addressed by this rulemaking.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
OSHA also proposed to revise the ``general requirements'' for PPE (1910.132) by adding provisions that: (1) require
employers to select appropriate PPE based on the hazards present and to assure that employees who obtain their own
PPE follow the employers' selection decisions; (2) prohibit the use of defective or damaged PPE; and (3) require that
employees be trained in the proper use of their PPE. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The NPRM set a period, that ended on October 16, 1990, during which interested persons could comment on the proposal
and request a hearing. OSHA received 129 comments in response to the proposal (Exhibit 3). The Agency also received
several requests for an informal public hearing to discuss and clarify some of the requirements in the proposal, and
to discuss and comment on issues and concerns raised as a result of the proposal. Accordingly, OSHA published a hearing
notice on February 1, 1990 (55 FR 3412). The hearing notice requested testimony and supporting information on the
following issues: (1) Marking of eye and face protection; (2) Third party certification; (3) The use of photochromic
lenses; (4) Training in the proper use of PPE; and (5) The need for additional regulation of PPE (such as gloves, chemical
protective clothing, and bump caps). The hearing notice (55 FR 3412) also extended the comment period until March
20, 1990. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Hearings on the proposed standard were held in Washington, D.C., on April 3 and 4, 1990, with Administrative Law Judge
Sheldon R. Lipson presiding. At the conclusion of the hearing, Judge Lipson set July 13, 1990, as the deadline for submission
of post hearing comments and evidence, and September 11, 1990, as the deadline for submission of summations and briefs.
On November 9, 1990, Judge Lipson certified the hearing record, including the hearing transcript and all written
submissions to the docket. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The rulemaking record contains 173 comments, 577 pages of testimony, and 53 exhibits.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 -->
II. Workplace Hazards Involved 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
OSHA has determined that workers involved in a wide range of occupations are exposed to a significant risk of death
or injury from being struck by various objects in the workplace. OSHA's incident data indicate that a significant
portion of all work related injuries and fatalities involve workers being struck in the eyes, head, face, hand, and
or feet by foreign objects. For example, it has been estimated that as many as 2,500 eye injuries occur in the workplace
every working day (Ex. 2: 9). 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
One study indicated that there were 333,272 reported occupational eye injuries for 1985 (Ex. 2: 8). Another study,
pertaining to 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
disabling
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 injuries, estimated that there were 320,000 hand and finger injuries, 70,000 eye injuries, 70,000 head and face injuries,
and 110,000 foot and toe injuries in 1987. These injuries constituted 31.7 percent of the estimated 1,800,000 total
disabling work injuries for 1987 (Ex. 2: 15). 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
These examples indicate the degree of the hazard to which employees are exposed. OSHA reviewed many sources that described
the type and number of injuries to employees (e.g. Ex. 2: 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 16, 17, 18, 19, 20, 21, 22; Ex.
6: 2, 3, 4). While these sources differ as to the number and kind of injuries, they are consistent in pointing out the
high incidence and severity of these accidents, and provide clear evidence of a significant risk to workers. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In particular, one data source reviewed by OSHA included the Bureau of Labor Statistics (BLS) Work Injury Reports
(WIR) on eye, face, foot, head and hand injuries (Ex. 2: 11, 12, 13, 14; Ex. 6: 2). These reports, which examined only
those cases where a worker was injured, identified two major factors: Personal protective equipment was not being
worn the vast majority of the time; and, when some type of protective equipment was worn, it did not fully protect the
worker. For example, one study (Ex. 6: 2) indicated that 70% of the workers experiencing hand injuries were not wearing
gloves. Hand injuries to the remaining 30% of the workers who were wearing gloves were caused by the gloves being either
inadequate, damaged, or the wrong type for the type of hazard present. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Based on the above-documented incidence of hand injury, OSHA has determined that employers and employees need more
guidance regarding the selection of hand protection than is provided through the generic provisions of proposed
1910.132(d). Therefore, as discussed below, the Agency has provided performance-oriented provisions by adding
1910.138, ``
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Hand protection
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
'' to the final rule. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The final rule addresses the problems identified in the BLS reports by allowing new innovative designs through the
use of performance-oriented language, by providing information for selecting the proper protection, and by improving
the protection afforded by the equipment. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
OSHA believes that the revised standards will result in improvement in worker acceptance of wearing PPE by allowing
better and more comfortable designs not presently permitted by the current standards, and by providing information
on selecting the proper equipment for the job. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Agency has determined that compliance with the final rule will result in a significant reduction in the risks to
workers. As noted in the Regulatory Impact Analysis, discussed below, it is estimated that full compliance with the
final rule will prevent 712,000 lost-workdays and 4 fatalities a year. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Agency has also determined that the revised PPE requirements and criteria in the final rule provide a cost-effective
means for reducing risks to workers. The Agency has determined that these provisions are reasonably necessary and
appropriate to address the need for personal protective equipment. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 -->
III. Summary and Explanation of the Final Rule 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
This section contains an analysis of the rulemaking record pertaining to certain issues raised in the NPRM, and to
the provisions of the standard, both as proposed and as promulgated. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
One general objection received during this rulemaking concerned the use of the phrase ``employers shall ensure''
in certain provisions of the proposed standard (e.g. Ex. 3: 46, 80, 94). The commenters expressed the view that, under
the proposed language, employers would be held liable for violations of the standards, regardless of employee misconduct
or other exculpatory considerations. The Agency had proposed the language in question to emphasize the employer's
obligations for compliance with OSHA standards. The proposed language would not have affected an employer's ability
to raise defenses to a citation. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In light of the objections, OSHA is revising the proposed language to remove the phrase ``the employer shall ensure''
wherever it appears. The employer's obligations for compliance with standards issued under the OSH Act are unaffected
by this change. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Also, concern was expressed regarding the extent to which the proposed standard would allow employees to use PPE that
satisfied the old ANSI standards which were being superseded by current editions through the proposal. In particular,
some commenters (Ex. 3: 68, 69, 100) suggested that the Agency ``grandfather'' existing stocks of PPE (i.e., allow
existing stocks of PPE to be depleted) as long as the PPE meets the ANSI standard in effect at the time of manufacture.
Those commenters stated that, without grandfathering, employers would be required to bear the unreasonable expense
and disruption of replacing millions of items of usable PPE. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The proposal simply required the affected PPE to comply with the then-current editions of the pertinent ANSI standards,
without indicating how PPE produced and tested to satisfy the existing OSHA standards would be treated. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Agency believes that virtually all of the PPE in question has been produced and tested to satisfy the ANSI editions
referenced in either the proposed rule or in the final rule. Therefore, OSHA believes that, by and large, existing
stocks of PPE would comply with the final rule. However, the Agency recognizes that some PPE that pre-dates the referenced
ANSI standards might be unnecessarily excluded from use unless it was ``grandfathered''. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In particular, certain protective footwear that complied with the 1983 ANSI edition referenced by the proposal could
be excluded from use because it was not produced and tested to satisfy the 1991 edition referenced by the final rule,
unless the employer demonstrated that the footwear provided equivalent protection. OSHA believes that the differences
between the 1983 and 1991 editions are so slight that it would be unreasonable to require employers to demonstrate
equivalency. The Agency also believes that PPE satisfying the pertinent criteria of the pre-1989 ANSI Z87.1 standard
for eye and face protection or the pre-1986 Z89.1 standard for head protection will adequately protect affected employees.
Therefore, the Agency agrees that it is appropriate to allow continued use of PPE that was purchased prior to the effective
date of the final rule and has revised the proposed rule accordingly. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In the final rule, as in the NPRM, OSHA has incorporated the pertinent ANSI standards by reference. The Agency has determined
that it is unnecessary to adopt the text of the three ANSI standards, because their criteria are addressed to PPE manufacturers,
not to employers who would be selecting PPE for use by their employees. OSHA believes that it is sufficient to require
that employers ensure either that the PPE used by employees complies with the appropriate ANSI standard or that the
PPE provides protection equivalent to that provided by PPE manufactured to the ANSI criteria.

1910.132 General Requirements. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Paragraphs (a), (b), and (c) of this section were not proposed for revision. Paragraph (a) requires that protective
equipment be provided, used and maintained in sanitary and reliable condition, as necessary, to protect employees
from workplace hazards. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Paragraph (b) requires that, where employees provide their own equipment, the employer assure the adequacy, including
the proper maintenance and sanitation, of such equipment. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Paragraph (c) requires that all personal protective equipment be of safe design and construction for the work to be
performed. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 -->
Paragraph (d): Selection. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
OSHA proposed to add a new paragraph, (d), to 1910.132 to address the selection of PPE. OSHA proposed to require employers
to select the PPE for their employees based on an assessment of the hazards in the workplace, and the hazards which employees
are likely to encounter. Because OSHA is aware that some employees obtain their own PPE, the Agency also proposed that
employers be required to inform their employees of the selection decisions and to have their employees follow those
decisions when obtaining PPE. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
OSHA believes that a hazard assessment is an important element of a PPE program because it produces the information
needed to select the appropriate PPE for the hazards present or likely to be present at particular workplaces. The
Agency believes that the employer will be capable of determining and evaluating the hazards of a particular workplace.
Paragraph (d) of the final rule is a performance-oriented provision which simply requires employers to use their
awareness of workplace hazards to enable them to select the appropriate PPE for the work being performed. Paragraph
(d) clearly indicates that the employer is accountable both for the quality of the hazard assessment and for the adequacy
of the PPE selected. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Proposed paragraph (d), which was substantively identical to the final rule, has been revised for the sake of clarity.
The Agency has also added a note which references Non-mandatory Appendix B of 1910.132. That Appendix provides an
example of procedures that satisfy the hazard assessment requirement. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Most rulemaking participants supported the proposed requirement (e.g. Ex. 3: 90, 91, 102). However, some commenters
stated that the proposed paragraph did not clearly indicate if employers would be required to document the hazard
assessment. For example, a commenter from S.C. Johnson &amp; Son, Inc. (Ex. 3: 1) suggested that OSHA clarify documentation
requirements of the workplace assessment. In addition, a commenter from Union Carbide (Ex. 3: 68, pp. 1&hyph;2) stated:

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG QTAG 04 -->
<!-- PJG /QTAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->
*&blank;*&blank;*&blank;OSHA should clarify that the hazard assessment referred to there need not be in writing.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
OSHA can best determine whether the employer conducted an adequate hazard assessment by inspecting the areas where
PPE is required. It should not be necessary for employers to prepare and retain a formal written hazard assessment.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG QTAG 04 -->
<!-- PJG /QTAG -->
 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
OSHA believes that some form of record is needed to provide OSHA compliance officers and affected employees with appropriate
assurance that the required hazard assessment has been performed. The Agency agrees with the commenter that it is
not ``necessary for employers to prepare and retain a formal written hazard assessment.'' Given the performance-oriented
nature of this rulemaking, OSHA has determined that the generation and review of extensive documentation would be
unnecessarily burdensome. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Agency has addressed such situations in other rulemakings by requiring employers to verify their compliance
with a requirement through a written certification. For example, OSHA has required certification of training in
the permit-required confined space standard, 1910.146(g)(4); the control of hazardous energy (lockout/tagout)
standard, 1910.147(c)(7)(iv); in the Telecommuni-cations standard, 1910.268(c); and (as discussed below) in
1910.132(f)(4) of this final rule. The Agency has found that a written certification is a reasonable means by which
to establish accountability for compliance. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Therefore, the Agency has determined that employers can adequately verify compliance with 1910.132(d) of the final
rule through a written certification which identifies the workplace evaluated; the person certifying that the evaluation
has been performed; the date(s) of the hazard assessment; and which identifies the document as a certification of
hazard assessment. This requirement has been added to the final rule as paragraph (d)(2). 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Paperwork Reduction Act (PRA) (44 U.S.C. Chapter 35) sets limits on the efforts of federal agencies to collect
``information''. The definition of ``information'' in the OMB regulations implementing the PRA (5 CFR 1320.7(j))
specifies that ``
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Information
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 does not generally include *&blank;*&blank;* certifications *&blank;*&blank;* provided that they entail no burden
other than that necessary to identify the respondent, the date, the respondent's address, and the nature of the instrument.''
OSHA has determined that the certification required by paragraph (d)(2) constitutes a ``certification'' for the
purposes of the PRA. Therefore, that certification would not be subject to the requirements of the Paperwork Reduction
Act or of the implementing regulations (5 CFR part 1320). 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Another concern raised during this rulemaking, related to the selection process, was the subject of proper fit of
PPE. A commenter (Ex. 7:10) has stated that, in the past, males constituted the majority of the workforce and PPE was
sized accordingly. As more and more females have entered the workforce, they often have had to choose between wearing
PPE that was sized to fit males, and not wearing PPE at all. This was particularly common with foot protection. As a result,
female workers frequently either have used PPE which did not adequately protect them, or have simply stopped using
PPE because of improper fit and subsequent discomfort. Based on concern for the safety of female employees, the commenter
suggested that OSHA require PPE to fit properly. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
OSHA agrees with this comment. Since females constitute a larger percentage of the workforce than ever before, it
is imperative that they (as well as male employees) be provided with PPE that fits properly. Therefore, OSHA is revising
1910.132 (d) to add proper fit as a criterion for PPE selection.

Paragraph (e): Defective and damaged equipment. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 OSHA proposed to add a new paragraph, (e), to 1910.132 that stated: 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG QTAG 04 -->
<!-- PJG /QTAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->
Defective or damaged personal protective equipment shall not be used.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG QTAG 04 -->
<!-- PJG /QTAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
This paragraph is based, in part, on existing 1910.133 (a)(2)(vii), which states that eye protectors should be kept
clean and in good repair. Under the proposed paragraph, the existing requirement was to be strengthened and extended
to cover all PPE, not just eye protectors. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Some commenters (e.g. Ex. 3: 1, 41) stated that proposed paragraph (e) should only cover visually observable defects
or damage. For example, a commenter from Johnson Wax (Ex. 3: 1) stated: 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG QTAG 04 -->
<!-- PJG /QTAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->
We urge OSHA to limit the scope of this section 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
to ``visible'' defects or damage in PPE.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG QTAG 04 -->
<!-- PJG /QTAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
OSHA certainly agrees that visibly damaged or defective PPE must not be used. However, there are other methods (such
as performance tests to ensure continued integrity) that the employer could use to assure that the PPE used by employees
is repaired or replaced as necessary for the protection of each affected employee. Also, employees can often determine
if the protectiveness of the PPE has been compromised when they are handling the PPE prior to or while donning it. Accordingly,
OSHA believes it would be inappropriate to narrow this provision to cover only visible defects or damage. Therefore,
the Agency is promulgating paragraph 1910.132 (e) as proposed. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 -->
Paragraph (f): Training. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Proposed paragraph (f) required employers to train employees in the proper use of their PPE. This proposed provision
was based on OSHA's recognition that, as documented by the Bureau of Labor Statistics Work Injury Reports (Ex. 2: 11,
12, 13, 14), a significant number of the employees who sustain work-related injuries have not been trained in the proper
use of PPE. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Some commenters (Ex. 3: 64, 117, 119) stated that PPE training, while necessary for respirators and other complex
PPE, is not necessary for relatively simple equipment such as safety shoes and eye protectors. In particular, the
American Trucking Association (ATA) (Ex. 3: 64) stated: 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG QTAG 04 -->
<!-- PJG /QTAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->
Requiring training and record-keeping for all PPE would severely burden motor carriers in terms of time and the related
costs.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG QTAG 04 -->
<!-- PJG /QTAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
As an alternative, the ATA suggested that OSHA set non-mandatory appendices for the guidance of employers. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Other commenters (Ex. 3: 84, 104, 121) suggested that the employer be required to train employees only for use of the
PPE that is required by the employer to provide protection against hazards identified for the particular workplace.
The Texas Chemical Council (Ex. 3: 121) stated: 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG QTAG 04 -->
<!-- PJG /QTAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->
Requiring the employer to train employees on equipment they provide creates an unnecessary and inappropriate burden
on the employer.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG QTAG 04 -->
<!-- PJG /QTAG -->
 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Several commenters (Ex. 3: 75, 83, 90, 106, 126) supported the training requirement, as proposed. Du Pont (Ex. 3: 90,
pg. 2) remarked: 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG QTAG 04 -->
<!-- PJG /QTAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->
Du Pont's position is that proper employee training is fundamental to an effective PPE program. We also agree with
the flexibility this proposed section provides employers.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG QTAG 04 -->
<!-- PJG /QTAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Some commenters (e.g. Ex. 3: 100, 104) suggested that OSHA revise the proposed paragraph (f) to indicate that training
need only be provided when PPE is first provided to employees. For example, Union Electric (Ex. 3: 100) said: 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG QTAG 04 -->
<!-- PJG /QTAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->
Company suggests adding ``at the time it is initially issued.'' The proposal, as written, could imply that employees
must be periodically retrained in the proper use of their equipment. This certainly is unnecessary for such items
as safety glasses, footwear and headgear, which usually are worn routinely on the job. Respirators already have a
periodic training requirement. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG QTAG 04 -->
<!-- PJG /QTAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Also, several commenters (Ex. 3: 46, 64, 102, 117) expressed concern that proposed 1910.132(f) would require employers
to operate formal training programs. For example, Monsanto (Ex. 3: 102, pg. 2) stated that OSHA should revise proposed
paragraph (f) to indicate clearly that the training required need not be formal classroom training. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In addition, McDonnell Douglas (Ex. 3: 129) inquired: 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG QTAG 04 -->
<!-- PJG /QTAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->
In regard to training all employees in the proper use of all PPE, what would qualify as ``training''? The term ``training''
could range from awareness type information to competency training of the employee. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
OSHA should define the term ``training'' or be specific in individual standards. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG QTAG 04 -->
<!-- PJG /QTAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Some commenters (Ex. 3: 36, 81, 119) stated that proposed paragraph (f) should be revised to require ``instruction''
rather than ``training''. The Motor Vehicle Manufacturers Association (MVMA) (Ex. 3: 81, pg. 2) said: 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG QTAG 04 -->
<!-- PJG /QTAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->
Training is too elaborate a term for the degree of explanation required with PPE. More sophisticated PPE such as respirators
or hearing protection, which require detailed training, is already provided for by certain OSHA standards. MVMA
recommends that subparagraph (f) be retitled ``Instruction'' and the term ``training'' be changed to ``instructed''.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG QTAG 04 -->
<!-- PJG /QTAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Some public hearing participants testified in support of the proposed 1910.132(f) performance-oriented approach
to training. For example, the Chemical Manufacturers Association (CMA) testified (Tr. 159: 4/3): 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG QTAG 04 -->
<!-- PJG /QTAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->
*&blank;*&blank;* CMA agrees that training is an essential element of an effective personal protective equipment
program. We believe, however, that OSHA should continue to address training with performance-oriented provisions,
not with HAZWOPER-type training requirements. Not only are additional requirements 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=3 -->
not
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->
 necessary, they would be over-burdensome. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG QTAG 04 -->
<!-- PJG /QTAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
In addition, many commenters (e.g., Ex. 3: 36, 41, 50, 60, 73, 86, 98, 116, 128) suggested that OSHA revise proposed
1910.132(f) to provide more detailed guidance regarding what constitutes adequate training. For example, CSX Transportation
(Ex. 3: 116) remarked: 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG QTAG 04 -->
<!-- PJG /QTAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->
A description of the performance requirements for a PPE training program should be included under 1910.132(f), since
training is the responsibility of the employer.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG QTAG 04 -->
<!-- PJG /QTAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Other commenters (Ex. 3: 123 and 128) emphasized that ``personal'' training is important to a successful training
program. For example, the Food &amp; Allied Services Trades (Ex. 3: 128, pg. 6) stated: 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG QTAG 04 -->
<!-- PJG /QTAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->
It is imperative that this training be conducted by ``live'' personnel who will be available to answer questions that
workers may have. Simply showing a twenty minute video tape shall not constitute adequate training. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG QTAG 04 -->
<!-- PJG /QTAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Also, commenters (Ex. 3: 36, 73) suggested that OSHA require training in the ``use and care'' of PPE. For example, the
Edison Electric Institute (EEI) (Ex. 3: 73, pg. 2) said: 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG QTAG 04 -->
<!-- PJG /QTAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->
To further enhance the protection provided by the standard, EEI recommends amending proposed 1910.132(f) to require
employees to be trained not only in the use of their equipment, but also in its care.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG QTAG 04 -->
<!-- PJG /QTAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Further, some commenters (Ex. 3: 41, 59, 128) suggested that OSHA require training in the ``use and limitations''
of PPE. The Food &amp; Allied Services Trades (Ex. 3: 128) stated that training in the limitations of PPE is needed ``to
prevent accidents from occurring due to overconfidence in the protective ability of certain types of equipment.''

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Other commenters (Ex. 3: 60, 107&hyph;D) suggested that employees be trained regarding PPE limitations and precautions.
The American Optometric Association (Ex. 3: 60) remarked: 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG QTAG 04 -->
<!-- PJG /QTAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->
We do not believe that Section 1910.132(f) on training requirements goes far enough to ensure that any limitations
or precautions provided by the manufacturer of the protector are transmitted to the user and care is taken to see that
such limitations are strictly observed. In addition, we do not believe that appendix B Non-Mandatory Compliance
Guidelines for Hazard Assessment and Personal Protective Equipment Selection adequately addresses this area.
There is no guarantee that the training provided employees in the use of eye and face protectors will uniformly cover
the limitations and precautions relating to the use of protectors unless specific requirements for this training
are given. We strongly urge that language making this a mandatory part of training be included in the regulation. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG QTAG 04 -->
<!-- PJG /QTAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Some other commenters (Ex. 3: 74, 88) suggested that training include information provided by PPE manufacturers.
For example, CF Industries, Inc. (CF) (Ex. 3: 74) objected to the proposed replacement of existing 1910.133(a)(5)
(which requires employers to pass on to employees any information received from manufacturers regarding the limitations
and precautions to be considered when using eye and face protection) by proposed 1910.132(f). The commenter stated:
``CF believes that the proposed section is too broad. Various pieces of personal protective equipment can be used
for the same purpose, but have very different limitations.'' 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Also, two commenters from the State of Connecticut (Ex. 3: 50, 51) stated that ``the final rule for 1910.132(f) should
lean towards being more specific'' and that proposed paragraph (f) should be revised to provide that ``Employees
shall be trained in the proper use, maintenance, care, warning labels and limitations of their personal protective
equipment.'' 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Other commenters (Ex. 3: 70, 86, 97) stated that proposed 1910.132(f) should be revised to incorporate the specific
training requirements of existing 1910.120, the standard for 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Hazardous Waste Operations and Emergency Response
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 (HAZWOPER). For example, the Emergency Response Management &amp; Training Corporation (Ex. 3: 97) stated: 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG QTAG 04 -->
<!-- PJG /QTAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->
As it [proposed 1910.132(f)] is currently written there are no specifications as to the quality or quantity of training
an employee will receive on the proper use and limitations of personal protective equipment. The inclusion of specific
knowledge requirements and competency demonstration may assist in the goal of improving worker safety in hazardous
environments. 29 CFR 1910.120 and NFPA 472&hyph;1989 (Standard for Professional Competence of Responders to Hazardous
Materials Incidents) are two examples of this type. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG QTAG 04 -->
<!-- PJG /QTAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Based on the concerns expressed regarding what constitutes adequate training, OSHA requested testimony in Issue
4 of the hearing notice (54 FR 3414, February 1, 1990) on the need for additional training requirements. In particular,
Issue 4 indicated that OSHA was considering the promulgation of more specific training requirements, including
provisions similar to those in existing 1910.120, Hazardous Waste Operations and Emergency Response (HAZWOPER).
The Agency also solicited input regarding what training is needed; how training can be evaluated; when retraining
is necessary; how much time is required for training; what recordkeeping is necessary for training activities; and
what impacts (i.e., costs and benefits) the training requirements would have. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
With respect to Issue 4, several commenters (Ex. 7: 3, 8, 11, 20, 29, 38) stated that the training requirements should
be more detailed. For example, the General Electric Company (Ex. 7: 3, pg. 2) said: 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG QTAG 04 -->
<!-- PJG /QTAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->
Protective equipment training needs to include: 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG QTAG 04 -->
<!-- PJG /QTAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->
1. Where and how personnel can get the equipment, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
2. A system for identifying the correct equipment for an application *&blank;*&blank;* procedures and operating
manuals should include specifics on protective equipment types, needs and objectives, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
3. Equipment should be shown to individuals prior to using each for the first time *&blank;*&blank;* let them touch
and try the items on, the more senses you allow one to use during training the better the person will recall what he/she
learned, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
4. Persons should not be considered competent in protective equipment items until they do a practical test *&blank;*&blank;*
 are able to properly put on the item, explain what protection it provides, etc. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG QTAG 04 -->
<!-- PJG /QTAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Also, Boeing (Ex. 7: 38) remarked: 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG QTAG 04 -->
<!-- PJG /QTAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->
Boeing supports the position that additional detail be included in 1910.132 regarding training objectives and methods.
Training should be based on the complexity of the protective equipment requirements. For certain protective equipment
(e.g. safety spectacles) training requirements should be minimal or nonexistent. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG QTAG 04 -->
<!-- PJG /QTAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
In addition, OSHA received testimony in favor of more specific training requirements at the public hearing. For example,
the National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health (NIOSH) testified (Tr. 23&hyph;24: 4/3) that the key elements
of a successful training program are: 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG QTAG 04 -->
<!-- PJG /QTAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->
1) Sensitizing the workers to the need for such protectors and inviting their participation in developing a suitable
plan for affecting PPE use. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
2) Clearly defining the written goals of the PPE program in terms of the target behaviors sought (e.g., appropriate
footwear/eyewear/headwear to be worn, in what areas, what kinds of care required). 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
3) Explicit rewards or recognition to be given contingent on the workers displaying actions that conform to the aforementioned
positive acts, including knowledge of results or other forms of feedback. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
4) Each PPE program should have some basis for evaluation (numbers of workers using/not using specified PPE) so that
modifications could be made should the efforts fall short of the stated goals. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG QTAG 04 -->
<!-- PJG /QTAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Also, the International Chemical Workers Union testified (Tr. 16: 4/4): 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
 Who is responsible for training employees in the proper use and limitations of personal protective equipment? It
is the employer's responsibility to carry out this training but it is not being done *&blank;*&blank;* Every worker
should be able to determine that the glove being provided to them by their employer is the right one for the chemicals
which they handle. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Another hearing participant, the National Environmental Training Association (NETA), testified (Tr. 272: 4/4)
that ``the proposal in 132(f) is not performance-oriented, it's too vague and nonspecific.'' NETA also testified
(Tr. 285: 4/4): 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG QTAG 04 -->
<!-- PJG /QTAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->
The National Environmental Testing Association feels that if OSHA seriously considers training to be important
in protecting worker safety *&blank;*&blank;* then the language at 29 CFR 1910.132(f) will have to be more specific.
Unless training is based on measurable objectives as OSHA has pointed out in the U.S. Department of Labor publication
OSHA 2254 (Training Requirements in OSHA Standards and Training Guidelines) then it can only be effective by coincidence.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG QTAG 04 -->
<!-- PJG /QTAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Many Issue 4 commenters (e.g. Ex. 7: 2, 13, 15, 21, 22) stated that OSHA should not promulgate more detailed training
requirements. Those commenters expressed the belief that performance-oriented proposed 1910.132(f) allowed
employers in general industry the flexibility to implement training programs as needed. For example, Amoco Corporation
(Ex. 7: 21, pg.2) stated: 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG QTAG 04 -->
<!-- PJG /QTAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->
We agree that employees should be trained in the proper use of their personal protective equipment, since the equipment
may not provide adequate protection if used improperly. We feel, however, that training programs are best left to
each employer to develop on an individualized, site-specific basis. Manufacturers often provide information on
their particular products upon which an instructional program can be based. Employers do need an effective formal
training session when the use of new or significantly different equipment is instituted. This requirement helps
ensure that time is actually dedicated to this purpose, and emphasizes the importance of proper use to the employee.
Training guidance would be helpful, especially to small businesses, but we feel strongly that such guidance should
be of a non-mandatory nature. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG QTAG 04 -->
<!-- PJG /QTAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
In addition, the Department of the Air Force (Ex. 7: 25) stated that it ``supports locally devised training, rather
than an OSHA legislated program training requirement, as both cost efficient and effective.'' 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Also, several Issue 4 commenters (Ex. 7: 19, 31, 35) stated that proposed 1910.132(f) should not incorporate the HAZWOPER
training requirements, because 1) general industry PPE was used in a broader class of work environments than HAZWOPER-mandated
PPE, and 2) the PPE covered by proposed 1910.132(f) (e.g., eye and face protection, head protection and foot protection)
was much less complex than that covered by HAZWOPER. For example, the American Petroleum Institute (API) (Ex. 7: 35)
stated: 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG QTAG 04 -->
<!-- PJG /QTAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->
Suggestions that would treat Subpart I in a manner similar to paragraph 1910.120 are without justification. There
is no relationship between the training requirements of paragraph 1910.120 (which are directly responsive to the
enabling legislation dealing with hazardous waste sites) and the use of PPE in the controlled environment of a more
typical place of employment.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG QTAG 04 -->
<!-- PJG /QTAG -->
 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
In addition, the National Solid Waste Management Association (NSWMA) stated (Ex. 7: 19, pg. 2&hyph;3): 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG QTAG 04 -->
<!-- PJG /QTAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->
While NSWMA supports the concept of a structure for training of employees in the use of PPE, we find the use of the Part
1910.120 training requirements for Hazardous Waste Operations and Emergency Response as a model for general industry
to be without any justification. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Section 1910.120 rule was intended to provide specific safety criteria to cover a specific industry segment.
There are other industries with equivalent or higher risks where the use of this section as a model would be appropriate.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
NSWMA suggests that OSHA instead consider a training requirement more closely aligned with the concepts of its Hazard
Communication Standard, wherein the complexity of the program required for compliance would be directly related
to the hazards present. Such a program would require a survey of hazards, establishment of specifications for PPE
to control those hazards, training for employees and documentation of the training, and availability of PPE information
to employees *&blank;*&blank;* In the low-risk example, having donning and doffing procedures formalized provides
no useful function. What is critical is communicating the need for employees to understand the hazards and the need
to utilize PPE on a consistent basis. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG QTAG 04 -->
<!-- PJG /QTAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Based on the rulemaking record, OSHA agrees with commenters that employers need more specific guidance regarding
how to train employees who use PPE. In particular, the Agency has determined that employees need training which enables
them to know, at least: 1) when PPE is necessary; 2) what PPE is necessary; 3) how to properly don, doff, adjust, and wear
PPE; 4) the limitations of the PPE; and 5) the proper care, maintenance, useful life and disposal of the PPE. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Accordingly, OSHA has revised proposed paragraph (f) so that paragraph (f)(1) of the final rule reads as follows:

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG QTAG 04 -->
<!-- PJG /QTAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->
The employer shall provide training, including retraining where appropriate, to each employee who is required by
this section to use PPE. Each such employee shall be trained to know at least the following: 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG QTAG 02 -->
<!-- PJG /QTAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->
(i) When PPE is necessary; 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(ii) What PPE is necessary; 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(iii) How to properly don, doff, adjust, and wear PPE; 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(iv) The limitations of the PPE; and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(v) The proper care, maintenance, useful life, and disposal of the PPE. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG QTAG 04 -->
<!-- PJG /QTAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The National Environmental Training Association (NETA) and other rulemaking participants asserted that in order
to have a successful training program, employers should set measurable training objectives and have their employees

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
demonstrate

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 that they have reached those objectives. For example, NETA testified (Tr. 272&hyph;286: 4/4) that in order for training
to be successful, clear and measurable objectives must be set, and employees must demonstrate that the training objectives
have been reached, by showing that they understand the information provided and that they can use the PPE properly.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
OSHA agrees with these remarks and has stated in one of its own publications (OSHA 2254&hyph;1988): 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG QTAG 04 -->
<!-- PJG /QTAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->
*&blank;*&blank;* in order for the training to be as successful as possible, clear and measurable objectives should
be thought out before the training begins. For an objective to be effective, it should identify as precisely as possible
what the individuals will do to demonstrate that they have learned, or that the objective has been reached. They should
also describe the important conditions under which the individual will demonstrate competence and define what constitutes
acceptable performance.

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG QTAG 04 -->
<!-- PJG /QTAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Therefore, paragraph (f)(2) of the final rule requires that each affected employee demonstrate an understanding
of the training specified in paragraph (f)(1), and the ability to use the PPE properly, before being allowed to perform
work requiring the use of PPE. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Paragraph (f)(3) of the final rule requires retraining when changes in workplace conditions or changes in the types
of PPE to be used render previous training obsolete, and when inadequacies in an affected employee's knowledge or
use of assigned PPE indicate that the employee has not retained the understanding or skill required by paragraph (f)(2).
This provision, which did not appear in the proposed rule, indicates clearly that employers have an ongoing responsibility
to maintain employee proficiency in the use and care of their PPE. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
OSHA received many comments regarding how employers would indicate their compliance with the proposed training
requirement. Some commenters (e.g., Ex. 3: 41, 90) noted a statement in the NPRM (54 FR at 33841) that ``the proposal
contains no recordkeeping requirements.'' Those commenters agreed with that approach, expressing the belief that
detailed recordkeeping would impose an unreasonable burden, and requested ``clarification'' that no recordkeeping
for training would be required. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Further, Detroit Edison (Ex. 3: 62), referring to proposed paragraph (f), noted, ``Documented proof of training
is required by other regulation. Is documentation required? OSHA should present a clearer picture of this requirement
or delete it.'' 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In addition, United Technologies (Ex. 3: 96) inquired, ``Will perceived improper use of PPE be deemed by OSHA evidence
of inadequate training in the absence of training documentation?'' 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Also, McDonnell Douglas (Ex. 3: 129) stated, ``Even though OSHA has stated to OMB that this NPR does not have any recordkeeping
requirements, what would be required to prove the ``training'' has been performed?'' 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Members of the Midwest Consortium for Hazardous Waste Worker Training (Ex. 3: 49, 59, 98, 123) suggested that OSHA
require employers to document the content of their training programs. For example, Murray State University (Ex.
3: 123) stated, ``Training should be mainly hands-on with appropriate documentation.'' 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In addition, several commenters (e.g. 3: 46, 75, 88, 116) stated that proposed paragraph (f) would already require
employers to document training. Some of those commenters (Ex. 3: 46, 88) stated simply that, contrary to the statement
in Section VII of the proposed rule, OSHA had proposed to require recordkeeping, so the Agency had a responsibility
to justify the burden and to properly estimate the cost of documentation. Other commenters (Ex. 3: 75, 116) stated
that the documentation was needed to verify compliance with the training requirements, and that OSHA should not impose
extensive recordkeeping requirements. For example, the Chemical Manufacturers Association (CMA) stated (Ex.
3: 75): 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG QTAG 04 -->
<!-- PJG /QTAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->
CMA agrees with OSHA's determination to omit recordkeeping from the proposed rule. While some form of verification
should be maintained as an indication that training has taken place, specific documentation requirements would
only add to the recordkeeping burden without increased safety benefits for employees.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG QTAG 04 -->
<!-- PJG /QTAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In addition, CSX Transportation (Ex. 3: 116) remarked: 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG QTAG 04 -->
<!-- PJG /QTAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->
In Section 1910.132 a new training requirement exists that will require the establishment of training records for
employees using PPE. While the standard does not specify any recordkeeping requirements, documentation for compliance
purposes is clearly indicated. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG QTAG 04 -->
<!-- PJG /QTAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
As noted above, OSHA requested additional comments on the proposed training provision, including information on
the recordkeeping needed to document compliance, in Issue 4 of the hearing notice (55 FR 3414, February 1, 1990). In
particular, Issue 4 indicated that, based on NPRM comments (Ex. 3: 70, 86, 97), OSHA was considering training requirements
similar to the HAZWOPER provisions promulgated in 1910.120(e). Section 1910.120(e)(6) requires employers to certify
successful completion of training and to give graduates a written certificate. That provision further provides
that persons who lack such certification shall be prohibited from engaging in hazardous waste operations. In response
to Issue 4, Jackson Products (Ex. 7: 8, pg. 2) stated: 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG QTAG 04 -->
<!-- PJG /QTAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->
Training of employees in the use of PPE should be the central focus of any rules OSHA is promulgating, as this issue has
the highest potential for reducing worker injuries. Documentation of the training programs could follow the existing
guidelines OSHA has developed for hazardous waste operations and employee right to know training, i.e., training
log, employee signature sheet, etc. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG QTAG 04 -->
<!-- PJG /QTAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
In addition, BP America (Ex. 7: 39) stated, ``we feel that the only criteria for successful completion of a training
course can be that the trainee has mastered the information to the instructor's satisfaction. This can be documented
in several ways including written exams and awarding of certificates.'' 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
As noted above, some Issue 4 commenters (Ex. 7: 13, 19, 25, 31, 35) opposed the adoption of the HAZWOPER training provisions
in proposed paragraph (f). Regarding the applicability of the HAZWOPER recordkeeping requirements, the National
Solid Wastes Management Association (NSWMA) stated (Ex. 7: 19, pg. 3): 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG QTAG 04 -->
<!-- PJG /QTAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->
Congress mandated additional regulations in the narrow field of the occupational safety and health of hazardous
waste workers because hazardous waste operations and remediations involve, in OSHA's words, ``unique'' work environments.
54 Fed. Reg. 9312. Congress recognized that such operations involve potential exposure to a number of hazardous health
risks unlike those encountered by employees in general industry activities. Thus, the OSHA standard prohibits work
upon a hazardous waste site by anyone who is not properly OSHA-qualified and OSHA-certified. Certification may be
granted only upon completion of initial training and continuing education courses within a comprehensive and exhaustive
number of areas. See 29 CFR  1910.120(e)(6). These comprehensive standards apply whenever and wherever hazardous
waste workers handle hazardous substances. The occupational safety and health requirements in Section 1910.120
were, accordingly, crafted in response to the Congressional insistence that safety and health standards 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=3 -->
more stringent
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->
 than those applied to general industry be fashioned. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG QTAG 04 -->
<!-- PJG /QTAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
As noted above, the NSWMA suggested that OSHA model the requirements of proposed 1910.132(f) on the Hazard Communication
Standard. The NSWMA recognized that recordkeeping would be necessary for training, stating: ``In a low-risk situation,
where bump hats and eye shields may be the only devices needed, a simple written program of several pages would suffice.''
In addition, the NSWMA stated: 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG QTAG 04 -->
<!-- PJG /QTAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->
Companies should not be required under this suggested system to gain prior OSHA certification of individual programs.
Rather, companies should be permitted to certify that they have developed and implemented programs that are consistent
with OSHA approved standards. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG QTAG 04 -->
<!-- PJG /QTAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
OSHA acknowledges that the proposed training provision implicitly required some method for verifying compliance.
The Agency believes that the discussion of recordkeeping in Issue 4 of the hearing notice provided adequate notice
that OSHA might require employers to create some method of verifying their training activities. Accordingly, based
on the rulemaking record and for the sake of clarity, the Agency is revising proposed paragraph (f) to state explicitly
that employers must verify that they have provided their employees with the requisite training. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Regarding the information needed to verify compliance, OSHA agrees with the commenters who have stated that it would
be inappropriate to require specific documentation of the training provided. Given the performance-oriented focus
of this rulemaking, the Agency has determined that the generation and review of extensive documentation would be
unnecessarily burdensome. The Agency also notes that the training needs of employees covered by paragraph (f) of
this section (approximately 22 million) are too diverse to enable OSHA to specify the details required for all of their
PPE training. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Based on the rulemaking record, OSHA has determined that employers can adequately verify compliance with 1910.132(f)
of the final rule through a written certification. The Agency has determined that a certification record which identifies
each employee trained, the date(s) of training, and which identifies the document as a certification of training
in the use of PPE, will provide adequate assurance that the employer has provided the requisite training. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Agency notes that OSHA has also required certification of training in the permit&hyph;required confined space
standard, 1910.146(g)(4); the control of hazardous energy (lockout/tagout) standard, 1910.147(c)(7)(iv); and,
in the Telecommunications standard, 1910.268(c). 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
OSHA also notes that such a document will not preclude a citation if the Agency determines that the employees have not,
in fact, been adequately trained. OSHA believes that compliance with this requirement, while imposing a minimal
burden, provides an important benefit because it enables the employer and OSHA to verify the status of training efforts.
Therefore, OSHA is promulgating new 1910.132(f)(4). 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Paperwork Reduction Act (PRA) (44 U.S.C. Chapter 35) sets limits on the efforts of federal agencies to collect
``information''. The definition of ``information'' in the OMB regulations implementing the PRA (5 CFR 1320.7(j))
specifies that ``Information does not generally include 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
*&blank;*&blank;* certifications *&blank;*&blank;* provided that they entail no burden other than that necessary
to identify the respondent, the date, the respondent's address, and the nature of the instrument.'' 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
OSHA has determined that the certification of training required by paragraph (f)(4) constitutes a ``certification''
for the purposes of the PRA.Therefore, the certification would not be subject to the requirements of the Paperwork
Reduction Act or of the implementing regulations (5 CFR Part 1320). 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 -->
1910.133 Eye and face protection. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Proposed 1910.133(a) contained general requirements for eye and face protection. Proposed paragraph (a)(1) required
the employer to ensure that employees use appropriate eye or face protection when they are exposed to eye or face hazards
from flying particles, molten metal, liquid chemicals, acid and caustic liquids, chemical gases or vapors, or potentially
injurious light radiation. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Proposed paragraph (a)(1) also required that eye protection used by employees provide both front and side protection
from flying objects. This portion of proposed paragraph (a)(1) resulted in many comments. Most rulemaking participants
agreed with OSHA that eye protectors should provide both front and side protection from flying objects (e.g. Ex. 3:
28, 49, 59, 61, 83, 128; Tr. 53: 4/3) because studies (Ex. 2: 11) have indicated that most injuries have occurred (in
those instances when eye protection was used) because flying objects went 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
around
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 the protection. However, several rulemaking participants disagreed with this requirement because they believed
that OSHA was proposing that 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
all
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 eye protectors would have to provide side protection (e.g. Ex. 3: 41, 69). For example, a commenter from the Exxon Company
(Ex. 3: 47, pp.1&hyph;2) said: 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG QTAG 04 -->
<!-- PJG /QTAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->
Exxon is concerned that the proposal could be interpreted to require all safety glasses to be equipped with side shields.
Exxon's position is that many situations exist where safety glasses without side shields are adequate. For such routine
operations, OSHA should not ignore the fact that most employees will be more reluctant to wear safety glasses with
side shields than glasses without side shields. The mandatory use of side shields on all safety glasses could deter
the overall use of safety glasses on and off the job which would ultimately lead to an increase in the total number of
eye injuries. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
We concur with OSHA that employees should be equipped with adequate eye protection to prevent injuries from flying
objects. In those instances where our employees may be potentially exposed to flying objects, our safety program
calls for the mandatory use of eye protection that provides both front and side protection. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG QTAG 04 -->
<!-- PJG /QTAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Another commenter, from the American Optometric Association, remarked (Ex. 3: 60, pg. 2): 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG QTAG 04 -->
<!-- PJG /QTAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->
While we recognize that mandatory side shields would afford additional protection in many instances, they may not
be practical in all situations. In addition, they may tend to reduce compliance with the use of the protector in cases
where peripheral hazard protection is not required. We would recommend that side shields be required 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=3 -->
only
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->
 when the job evaluation indicates that a definite peripheral hazard exists. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG QTAG 04 -->
<!-- PJG /QTAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
OSHA intended that proposed paragraph (a)(2) require side protection only when flying object hazards were present.
Therefore, the Agency has revised the provision concerning flying object hazards to state clearly that front and
side protection are required when there is a hazard from flying objects. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
OSHA agrees that there are situations when side protection is unnecessary, and that employers should be allowed to
decide, based on a hazard assessment which complies with the requirements of 1910.132(d) of the final rule, if such
protection is necessary for their employees. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
While one rulemaking participant (Ex. 3: 66) believed that side shields should be permanently attached, other rulemaking
participants stated that side protectors need not be permanent and that OSHA should permit detachable or clip-on
side protectors. For example, a commenter from Liberty Optical (Ex. 3: 63) said: 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG QTAG 04 -->
<!-- PJG /QTAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->
Clip-on side shields meet all the Z&hyph;87 performance standards that the permanent side shields meet and can be
worn when necessary. To be able to wear proper protection where appropriate and be realistic in its use, will make the
employee not look to side step it and, therefore, make it more effective and safer. If a blanket mandatory permanent
side shield regulation to cover all industrial environments is implemented, it will reverse all gains made in recent
years and will not accomplish its goal for a safer industrial environment. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG QTAG 04 -->
<!-- PJG /QTAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
OSHA agrees that side protection need not be permanent and that detachable side shields should be permitted as long
as they meet the criteria specified in this section of the final rule. Permitting detachable side shields will provide
employers the flexibility to use this kind of protection when necessary, based on conditions at the workplace. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Agency has revised proposed paragraph (a)(1) accordingly, dividing the proposed paragraph into two provisions,
1910.133(a)(1) and (a)(2). Paragraph (a)(1) of the final rule states the general requirement to have each employee
use eye or face PPE when exposed to eye or face hazards, while paragraph (a)(2) states that eye PPE must provide side
protection, which may be detachable, when flying object hazards are present. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Proposed paragraph (a)(2) required that eye and face protection properly fit employees. Although the Agency did
not receive any comments concerning the proper fit of eye and face protection, OSHA did receive comments addressing
the proper fit of PPE, in general, and the need for properly fitting PPE for both male and female employees. This subject
was discussed previously under 1910.132 of this preamble, and OSHA has included a requirement in 1910.132 of the final
rule that 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
all
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 PPE properly fit employees. Therefore, proposed paragraph (a)(2) has not been included in the final rule, since it
would be redundant. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
OSHA proposed in paragraph (a)(3) that protectors with tinted or variable tinted lenses not be worn when an employee
must pass from a brightly lighted area, such as outdoors, into a dimly lighted area, such as a warehouse. The Agency
proposed this requirement because it believed that the provision might reduce the likelihood that extreme lighting
changes would temporarily impair the vision of an employee. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
This proposed requirement was the subject of Issue 3 of the hearing notice (55 FR 3412, February 1, 1990). The proposed
paragraph and Issue 3 generated a substantial amount of comment and testimony. While a few rulemaking participants
agreed with the proposed provision (e.g. Ex. 3: 28; Ex. 7: 2, 38), many opposed the provision and/or approach proposed
by OSHA (e.g. Ex. 3: 55, 61, 68; Ex. 7: 7, 8, 15, 23; Tr. 193: 4/3; Tr. 150&hyph;156: 4/4; Tr. 169: 4/4). Some of the rulemaking
participants stated that the proposed paragraph was too restrictive and vague. These rulemaking participants stated
that the 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
employer
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 (or designated safety officer) should decide when the use of this type of eyewear may create a hazard. This approach
is similar to that used in the ANSI standard for eye protection (ANSI Z87.1&hyph;1989; paragraph 6.5.2). 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
For example, a commenter from the American Optometric Association (Ex. 7: 11, pg. 2) stated: 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG QTAG 04 -->
<!-- PJG /QTAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->
The use of photochromic lenses in industrial situations is dependent upon the visual demands of the task and the visual
needs of the wearer. The decision on the need for and use of photochromic lenses can best be made by evaluation of the
work place requirements by the employer in consultation with the employee's eye doctor. The development of a blanket
policy restricting the use of photochromic lenses for certain job tasks is unwarranted. The individual visual needs
and working conditions should dictate when photochromic lenses may be inappropriate. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The American Optometric Association supports the ANSI Z87.1 position which provides employers the discretion to
decide when photochromic lenses may be utilized. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG QTAG 04 -->
<!-- PJG /QTAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Additionally, an ophthalmologist from the Mount Sinai Medical Center (Ex. 7: 14 pg. 2) remarked: 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG QTAG 04 -->
<!-- PJG /QTAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->
*&blank;*&blank;* the many beneficial features of photochromic lenses, particularly in safety glasses, justifies
their continued unfettered use in the workplace. My concern is that this proposed government intervention will likely
deter workers from using these photochromic lenses as safety devices and that increased numbers of eye injuries and
workplace accidents will ultimately result. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG /QTAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
A hearing participant from Corning, Inc. (Tr. 111&hyph;114: 4/4) testified: 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG QTAG 04 -->
<!-- PJG /QTAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->
Today, photochromic lenses are used throughout the world and over 500 million lenses have been sold. Roughly, more
than 250 million pairs of eye glasses. Currently, more than 38 million photochromic lens blanks are sold each year.
Corning has therefore literally hundreds of millions of man years of experience with the use of photochromic eyeglasses
without any reported health of safety problem of the type to which the proposed regulation is addressed. I believe
that proposal 1910.133 (a)(3) is too vague and is in any event unnecessary and overly restrictive. The use of photochromic
lenses are subject to the ANSI Z87.1 standards including paragraph 6.5.2 and we believe this is the appropriate standard
for dealing with any possible need for a limitation on photochromic usage. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG QTAG 04 -->
<!-- PJG /QTAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
That witness also asserted (Tr. 120: 4/4): 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG QTAG 04 -->
<!-- PJG /QTAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->
In daylight, outdoors, when the photochromic lenses darken to function as sunglasses they protect the eyes dark adaptation
process. It is well known that those who wear sunglasses in sunlight adapt to darker environments up to twice as fast
as those who do not. In the transient condition, that is, coming in from a brighter outdoor condition to a darker indoor
condition, wearing photochromic lenses can actually provide better and more comfortable vision under a broad variety
of work conditions. Visual function in the transition to and from bright light is superior when photochromic rather
than clear lenses are used. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG QTAG 04 -->
<!-- PJG /QTAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
After evaluating the rulemaking record, OSHA has concluded that the proposed requirement was too restrictive. The
Agency has determined that the employer, or the employer's representative (such as the company safety professional),
will be in the best position to determine when tinted or variable tint lenses should or should not be used, based on awareness
of workplace conditions. OSHA also notes that this approach is consistent with the current ANSI standard (ANSI Z87.1&hyph;1989-paragraph
6.5.2) which is (as discussed below) being incorporated by reference in the final rule. Accordingly, proposed paragraph
(a)(3) has not been retained in the final rule. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Proposed paragraph (a)(4) required that employees who wear prescription lenses while engaged in operations that
involve eye hazards shall wear eye protection that incorporates the prescription in their design, or shall be protected
by eye protection that can be worn over prescription lenses without disturbing the proper position 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
of the prescription or protective lenses. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Agency did not receive any comments on this proposed provision and it is, therefore, contained in the final rule
as proposed. However, since this section has been reorganized, the provision has been redesignated as 1910.133(a)(3)
of the final rule. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Existing 1910.133 (a)(4) states that ``every protector shall be distinctly marked to facilitate identification
only of the manufacturer.'' OSHA had proposed to delete this provision because the Agency believed that compliance
did not add to or detract from the safety of the protector. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Although a few commenters agreed with OSHA in principle (e.g. Ex. 3: 50, 92, 115), the vast majority of commenters stated
that the marking requirement should not be deleted (e.g. Ex. 3: 75, 88, 92, 114, 126). 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
For example, a commenter from the Optical Laboratories Association (Ex. 3: 71, pg. 4) asserted: 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG QTAG 04 -->
<!-- PJG /QTAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->
The existing system of easily identifying the manufacturers of the components of eye PPE is embedded in the standard
to assure accountability and is accepted throughout the industry. It should be retained.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG QTAG 04 -->
<!-- PJG /QTAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->
Since employees are permitted to provide their own eye protection and employers are held accountable to ensure that
employees are wearing the proper eye protection, these markings provide employers a ready way of checking for whether
or not employees are wearing the proper eye protection.

The identification markings are necessary in the event of a manufacturing defect or material defect, so that the purchaser
may receive an adjustment from the seller or manufacturer. Identification is also needed in case the manufacturer

In supporting the concept that OSHA should be consistent with the ANSI requirement for marking, a commenter from US
West, Inc. (Ex. 3: 85, pp. 2&hyph;3) stated: 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG QTAG 04 -->
<!-- PJG /QTAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->
US WEST, Inc. recommends that the identifying marking, i.e. manufacturers monogram and ``Z87'', continue to be required
(ANSI Z87.1&hyph;1989 8.10). US WEST, Inc. disagrees with OSHA's statement that``&sect;*&blank;*&blank;* marking
to identify the manufacturers of eye and face protection does not add or delete from the safety afforded by the protector.''
Lenses meeting ANSI Z87 are easily identified by the manufacturers monogram. ``Street'' or ``dress'' spectacles
not meeting ANSI Z87 are also easily identified by the absence of such markings. US WEST, Inc. has found non-Z87 replacement
prescription lenses placed in employees Z87 frames, reducing the employees degree of protection.

Based on the above-discussed comments, OSHA included Issue 1 in the Hearing Notice, to elicit more information regarding
the utility of compliance with existing 1910.133(a)(4). The comments and testimony received (Ex. 7: 2, 13, 31; Tr.
55, 133, 156: 4/3; Tr. 68, 148, 225: 4/4) uniformly supported retaining the marking requirement. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
For example, one commenter from SIGNODE (Ex. 7: 6) stated: 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG QTAG 04 -->
<!-- PJG /QTAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->
There is agreement that marking of eye and face protection ``does not add or detract from the safety afforded by the
protector'' however, the current etched lens marking provide the safety manager, management and supervision a means
of verifying that the worker, employee, contractor or visitor is, in fact, wearing proper safety eyewear, not street
wear.Based on the rulemaking record, OSHA has concluded that the requirement for marking of eye and face protectors
should be retained. OSHA agrees with commenters that the marking of eye and face protectors provides easy recognition
that the protectors meet specified criteria (ANSI Z87.1&hyph;1989); that marking will provide accountability,
and traceability in cases of product recall; and that marking requirements should be consistent with the ANSI Z87.1&hyph;1989
standard, since this is the accepted and recognized practice throughout the industry. Accordingly, the requirement
for marking of eye and face protectors is being retained in 1910.133(a)(4) of the final rule. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG QTAG 04 -->
<!-- PJG /QTAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Proposed paragraph (a)(5) required that employees use equipment with filter lenses that have a shade number appropriate
for the work being performed for protection from potentially injurious light radiation. OSHA also proposed a table
in this paragraph which contained a list of appropriate shade numbers for various operations. The Agency did not receive
any comments on this provision, and it is contained in the final rule with minor editorial changes. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Proposed paragraph (b) of 1910.133 contained ``acceptable design'' requirements for eye and face protection. In
this provision, OSHA proposed that eye and face protection comply with the design requirements specified in ANSI
Z87.1&hyph;1989, or be of a design which could be demonstrated to be equally effective. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Rulemaking participants supported the proposed adoption of the ANSI standard for eye and face protection (ANSI Z87.1&hyph;1989).
However, a few commenters (e.g. Ex. 3: 101, 125) expressed concern that the Agency proposed to adopt only the ``design
requirements'' of ANSI Z87.1. These commenters asserted that OSHA should adopt by reference all of the ANSI standard,
not just the design requirements. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
OSHA agrees that eye and face protective devices must meet all of the provisions contained in the ANSI standard. This
requirement is stated explicitly in ANSI Z87.1&hyph;1989, Section 3. OSHA acknowledges that the proposal did not
clearly express the Agency's intent to reference ANSI Z87.1&hyph;1989 in its entirety and is revising the proposed
rule accordingly. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Other rulemaking participants (e.g. Ex. 3: 1, 62, 75, 102, 128) suggested that OSHA adopt by reference the ``current''
edition of all of the applicable ANSI standards (i.e., the ANSI standards for eye and face protection, head protection,
and foot protection) rather than referencing a specific edition. These commenters stated that this approach would
prevent a situation where the OSHA standards would be outdated when the ANSI standards are revised in the future. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
OSHA notes that it would be improper for the Agency to reference consensus standards as suggested, because such action
would illegally subdelegate authority over the content of OSHA standards to the committees responsible for updating
the ANSI standards. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Agency will accept eye and face protective devices as complying with this section if they are demonstrated to be
as effective as those meeting the specific ANSI standard referenced by the final rule. For example, the final rule
is incorporating by reference the 1989 edition of ANSI Z87.1 for eye and face protection. Eye and face protective devices
meeting a subsequent edition of the same ANSI standard would be acceptable to the Agency (and a de minimis violation
of the standard) if it could be demonstrated by the employer that they were as effective as those meeting the 1989 edition.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In particular, employers would need to establish either that there was no substantive difference between a subsequent
edition of Z87.1 and the 1989 edition, or that PPE which satisfied subsequently modified test criteria provided protection
equivalent to that provided by PPE which satisfied the 1989 edition. Proposed paragraph (b) of 1910.133 has been revised
accordingly. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The incorporation by reference of ANSI Z87.1&hyph;1989 has been approved by the Office of the Federal Register, in
accordance with the requirements of 5 U.S.C. 552(a) and 1 CFR part 51. Therefore, proposed paragraph (b) has been revised
so that paragraph (b)(1) of the final rule reflects that approval and provides the requisite information regarding
access to the text of ANSI Z87.1&hyph;1989. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
As discussed above, OSHA has also determined that it is appropriate to permit the continued use of eye and face PPE purchased
prior to the effective date of the final rule, as long as it complies with the ANSI standard (Z87.1&hyph;1968) referenced
by existing 1910.133(a)(6). To this end, the Agency has redesignated proposed paragraph (b) as paragraph (b)(1)
of the final rule and has added ``grandfathering'' text in paragraph (b)(2) of the final rule. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
With respect to the subject of eye and face protection, Issue 5 of the Hearing Notice (55 FR 3412) requested comments
and information concerning the use of contact lenses. Specifically, the Agency asked if it should expand its eye and
face requirements to cover contact lenses. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Some commenters (e.g. Ex. 7: 13, 15, 16) stated that no additional regulations were necessary for the use of contact
lenses. Other commenters (Ex. 7: 21, 26) believed that OSHA should address the issue of contact lenses in the final
rule, and should clarify if it is permissible to wear contact lenses with eye protection. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Several commenters (e.g. Ex. 3: 107&hyph;D; Ex. 7: 5, 22) stated that wearing contact lenses with appropriate eye
protection does not present any additional hazards. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Based on the rulemaking record, OSHA believes that contact lenses do not pose additional hazards to the wearer, and
has determined that additional regulation addressing the use of contact lenses is unnecessary. The Agency wants
to make it clear, however, that contact lenses are not eye protective devices. If eye hazards are present, appropriate
eye protection must be worn instead of, or in conjunction with, contact lenses.

1910.135 Head Protection 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Proposed 1910.135 set requirements for the use of protective helmets and set criteria for acceptable equipment designs.
Proposed paragraph (a) required employees to wear protective helmets (1) ``when working in areas where there is a
potential for injury to the head from falling or moving objects'' and (2) ``where they are near exposed electrical
conductors which could be contacted by the protective helmets.'' Proposed paragraph (b) referenced American National
Standard, ANSI Z89.1&hyph;1986, ``Protective Headwear for Industrial Workers-Requirements''. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The proposed language was based on existing 1910.132(a) and 1910.135 and on ANSI Z89.1&hyph;1986. Existing 1910.132(a)
requires that the PPE necessary to protect employees from workplace hazards be provided, used and maintained properly.
That standard specifically includes head protection under its coverage. Existing 1910.135 facilitates compliance
with existing 1910.132(a) regarding helmets worn for protection ``from falling and flying objects and from limited
electric shock and burn,'' by requiring that those helmets comply with the American National Standard Safety Requirements
for Industrial Head Protection, Z89.1&hyph;1969. ANSI Z89.1&hyph;1986 is the most recent edition of the pertinent
national consensus standard. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Proposed 1910.135(a)(1), unlike existing 1910.135, explicitly required the use of protective helmets. The proposed
paragraph also made some editorial revisions to existing 1910.135. For example, the proposal replaced ``flying''
with ``moving'', because OSHA believed the term ``moving'' better described the means in which objects contact employees.
OSHA used the terms ``flying'' and ``moving'' in the existing and proposed rules, respectively, in conjunction with
the term ``falling'' to be consistent with ANSI Z89.1&hyph;1969. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
A commenter (Ex. 7: 20) stated that OSHA should address lateral impact protection ``since there are substantial injuries
that occur from directions other than vertical impact*&blank;*&blank;*&sect;'' In the course of this rulemaking,
OSHA obtained a helmet (Ex. 46) capable of protecting employees against lateral as well as vertical impacts. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In addition, NIOSH testified (Tr. 30: 4/3) that, while most blows to the head come from the back, front or side, ANSI
Z89.1 1986 addresses only protection for the top of the head. NIOSH further testified: ``Currently helmets are being
marketed that provide impact protection to most parts of the head. OSHA standards should encourage the use of these
more protective helmets.'' 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Some rulemaking participants (Ex. 3: 84, 96) expressed concern regarding the use of the term ``moving'' in the proposed
paragraph. For example, the American Petroleum Institute (API) (Ex. 3: 84, pg. 4) stated: 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG QTAG 04 -->
<!-- PJG /QTAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->
API is opposed to the wording of this paragraph. The ANSI Standard Z89.1&hyph;1986 referenced in 1910.135(b) contains
helmet specifications ``to protect the heads of industrial workers from impact or penetration by 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=3 -->
falling objects
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->
*&blank;*&blank;*'' OSHA must recognize that the ANSI standard does not provide design criteria for moving objects.
If OSHA intends this section to also cover helmets protecting against 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=3 -->
moving
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->
 objects, as proposed in 1910.135(a)(1), additional design criteria should be cited in 1910.135(b).
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG QTAG 04 -->
<!-- PJG /QTAG -->
 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
In addition, United Technologies (Ex. 3: 96, pg. 2) stated: 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG QTAG 04 -->
<!-- PJG /QTAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->
Under 1910.135 Head Protection, we find the requirement to provide head protection vague, and welcome additional
clarification from OSHA with regard to potential for injury to the head from moving objects. We are concerned compliance
personnel will interpret the requirement so broadly as to include any use of hoisting equipment. Although we can envision
an occasional situation where there may be a hazard, most operations using a hoist would present no significant hazard.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG QTAG 04 -->
<!-- PJG /QTAG -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Another commenter (Ex. 3: 40) suggested that OSHA revise proposed 1910.135(a)(1) so that the provision ``Mandates
that employers require their employees wear protective helmets when they are in an area where there is potential for
injury to the head from falling, moving, 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
swinging, flying or airborne objects
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
.'' The commenter did not state why it believed the recommended language was needed. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
 Also, commenters (Ex. 3: 72, 79) stated that proposed 1910.135(a)(1) should also require employees to wear head protection
when working in confined spaces and commenters (Ex. 3: 79, 119) have stated that OSHA should require protection against
impacts with fixed objects.. For example, Centel (Ex. 3: 72) noted that injuries may result from contact with low hanging
structures and that Centel already requires its employees working in confined spaces to wear head protection. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In addition, the Tennessee Valley Authority (TVA) (Ex. 3: 79) stated: 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG QTAG 04 -->
<!-- PJG /QTAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->
We believe a statement should be added with provision for protection against impacts with fixed objects. We recommend
a sentence should be added that addresses this hazard. We also suggest that in areas that are confined or congested
and the employee is subject to impact with fixed objects, suitable protective helmets be worn. We recommend that bump
caps should not be used in an industrial environment because there are too many possibilities of head injuries that
could occur. We recommend maximum head protection at all times in this type of environment. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG QTAG 04 -->
<!-- PJG /QTAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The current ANSI standard, Z89.1&hyph;1986, addresses only protection ``from impact and penetration by falling
objects and from high-voltage electric shock and burn.'' The Agency has determined that it would be inappropriate
for 1910.135(a) to cover head protection that is not also covered by the ANSI standard referenced in 1910.135(b),
unless OSHA provides criteria for assessing compliance. The Agency has determined that it is not in a position to set
such criteria, so OSHA has deleted the term ``moving'' from 1910.135(a)(1) of the final rule and has not added the terms
suggested by commenters. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Agency believes that compliance with the ANSI criteria referenced through 1910.135(b) of the final rule will
enable employers to protect their employees from a large proportion of potential head hazards. Head protection not
covered by 1910.135 of the final rule, such as would be needed to protect employees from ``moving'' or ``fixed'' objects,
is covered by the general requirements of 1910.132, as revised. OSHA anticipates that employers whose hazard assessments
identify head hazards that are not abated through compliance with ANSI Z89.1&hyph;1986, will develop and implement
other measures as necessary, to protect their employees. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Proposed 1910.135(a)(2) required that employees who are near exposed energized conductors which their heads could
contact must wear helmets designed for protection from electrical hazards. Two commenters (Ex. 3: 36, 73) suggested
that OSHA revise the proposed provision by adding requirements for proper maintenance of head protection. In particular,
Public Service Electric and Gas Company (Ex. 3: 36) stated that proposed paragraph (a)(2) should also require: ``Protective
helmets shall be worn and cared for as recommended by the manufacturer. Protective helmets shall not be altered or
defaced which would take away the impact and/or dielectric integrity of the helmet.'' 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
OSHA has determined that any employee protection which could result from compliance with the suggested language
on maintenance will already be attained through compliance with existing and proposed 1910.132. This section contains
requirements concerning defective and damaged equipment, 1910.132(e); and, training requirements pertaining
to the maintenance of PPE, 1910.132(f)(1)(v). 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Another commenter (Ex. 3: 81) stated that proposed paragraph (a)(2) was unclear, because it appeared ``to require
nonconductive helmets for electricians whenever they are ``near exposed electrical conductors'' even if there
is no reasonable probability of contact.'' The commenter suggested that OSHA revise the proposed language to require
the wearing of protective helmets ``WHEN they are near exposed electrical conductors which 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
their heads could contact.'' 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Agency notes that the suggested language is consistent with the description of proposed paragraph (a)(2) in the
preamble to the proposed rule (54 FR 33836). OSHA agrees that clarification of the proposed paragraph is appropriate
and has revised the proposed paragraph accordingly. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Proposed 1910.135(b) required that the design of protective helmets comply with the design requirements of ANSI
Z89.1&hyph;1986 or be of a design that provides equivalent protection. Existing 1910.135 references the requirements
and specifications established in ANSI Z89.1&hyph;1969. As noted in the preamble to the NPRM (54 FR 33837), OSHA has
determined that, except as regards electrical insulation for Class B helmets, the 1969 and 1986 editions of ANSI Z89.1
set essentially the same requirements. The Agency also has determined that Class B helmets currently in use already
comply with the electrical insulation requirements of ANSI Z89.1&hyph;1986. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
OSHA also proposed to allow protective helmets which, while not designed to the specifications of ANSI Z89.1&hyph;1986,
were ``demonstrated to be equally effective''. The Agency believed that this performance-oriented approach would
encourage innovation and the use of improved equipment. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
A commenter (Ex. 3: 119) stated that the proposed language allowing protective helmets of a design which has been demonstrated
to be equally effective ``is not well defined.'' In addition, the commenter questioned the availability of the means
and the personnel to determine if helmets not designed according to ANSI Z89.1&hyph;1986 were equally effective.
The commenter suggested that OSHA delete the language in question and require compliance with ANSI Z89.1&hyph;1986.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Another commenter (Ex. 7: 20, pg. 3), in discussing the proposed language ``demonstrated to be equally effective'',
inquired: 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG QTAG 04 -->
<!-- PJG /QTAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=3 -->
Does this mean or does it include possible 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
_prototype lab tests with field trials 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
_engineering or technical expert evaluation 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
_certification agency assessment 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
_appropriate standard and certification by foreign manufacturer, or certification or testing agency which could
presumably satisfy the primary intent for protection of the reference standard. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
To require a user to develop a new standard or a new certification process for a new product or design already proven
elsewhere could void the flexibility intended in the ``equivalency'' clause. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG QTAG 04 -->
<!-- PJG /QTAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
OSHA believes that the performance criteria set out in ANSI Z89.1&hyph;1986, Section 7, indicate clearly how employers
or the Agency can determine if helmets that do not otherwise comply with the consensus standard are ``equally effective''.
OSHA also believes that the performance-oriented language of proposed paragraph (b) allows employers the appropriate
flexibility to address their particular safety needs. Another commenter (Ex. 3: 126) stated that ``protective helmets
should comply with the performance requirements as well as the design requirements of ANSI Standard Z89.1&hyph;1986.''

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In the course of evaluating these comments, OSHA noted that there are no provisions specifically designated as ``design
requirements'' in ANSI Z89.1&hyph;1969 or ANSI Z89.1&hyph;1986. The 1986 edition, in particular, sets scope and
purpose provisions; definitions; types and classes provisions; materials provisions; physical requirements;
performance requirements; and test methods for protective helmets. The preamble discussion of proposed paragraph
(b) (54 FR 33836&hyph;33837) referenced the physical requirements (e.g., the maximum weight), the performance
requirements (e.g., impact resistance, penetration protection, flammability, water absorption resistance and
electrical insulation) and the test methods (e.g., ``stringent'' test methods for testing of ``Class B'' helmets
against high-voltage) of ANSI Z89.1&hyph;1986. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
OSHA agrees, and intends, that head PPE meet all of the provisions contained in the ANSI standard. This requirement
is stated explicitly in ANSI Z89.1&hyph;1986, Section 2. OSHA acknowledges that the proposal did not clearly express
the Agency's intent to reference ANSI Z89.1&hyph;1986 in its entirety and is revising the proposed provision accordingly.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The incorporation by reference of ANSI Z89.1&hyph;1986 has been approved by the Office of the Federal Register, in
accordance with the requirements of 5 U.S.C. 552(a) and 1 CFR part 51. Paragraph (b) of the final rule has been revised
to reflect that approval and to provide the requisite information regarding access to the text of ANSI Z89.1&hyph;1986.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
As discussed above, OSHA has determined that it is appropriate to permit the continued use of head PPE purchased prior
to the effective date of the final rule, as long as it complies with the ANSI standard (Z89.1&hyph;1969) referenced
by existing 1910.135. To this end, the Agency has redesignated proposed paragraph (b) as paragraph (b)(1) of the final
rule and has added ``grandfathering'' text in paragraph (b)(2) of the final rule. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In the proposal (54 FR 33837), OSHA solicited comments and information concerning bump caps, head protection that
was not addressed in existing or proposed 1910.135 and that would not satisfy the criteria of Z89.1&hyph;1986. In
particular, the Agency requested information with respect to the appropriateness of addressing this type of head
protection in the final rule. OSHA also solicited input regarding the need for regulation of bump caps in Issue 5 of
the Hearing Notice (55 FR 3412). Some rulemaking participants (e.g. Ex. 3: 28, 40, 58) have suggested that OSHA establish
requirements for bump caps. For example, Sandia National Laboratories (Ex. 3: 58) stated: 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG QTAG 04 -->
<!-- PJG /QTAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=3 -->
Currently, there are no Federal standards, regulations, or guidance of any kind with which industry can make proper
and adequate decisions on the use of bump caps. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Bump caps are not new to the work place. Where the risk of head injury has been determined to be of low probability or result
in minor contusions, scraps or cuts, bump caps have been provided. The old adage that ``something is better than nothing''
tends to prevail when industry is forced to make an educated guess. Is the adage true in the case of bump caps? 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In summary there is a need for Federal time and money to be spent on discovering the pro's and con's associated with bump
caps and developing corresponding guidance for their use in the work place.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG QTAG 04 -->
<!-- PJG /QTAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
On the other hand, Kerr-McGee Corporation (Ex. 3: 119, pg. 3) stated : 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG QTAG 04 -->
<!-- PJG /QTAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=3 -->
Kerr-McGee's use of bump caps is limited to areas where there is no potential for injury to the head from electrical
contact or from falling or moving objects, but where a hazard may exist due to striking one's head against fixed, low-clearance
objects. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Kerr-McGee is not aware of any voluntary or consensus standards covering bump caps. If the degree of protection afforded
by currently-produced bump caps is determined by scientific studies to be inadequate for their intended use as stated
on the products, then OSHA should request ANSI to develop a standard. Otherwise, we do not see the need for additional
specifications or standards.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG QTAG 04 -->
<!-- PJG /QTAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Most rulemaking participants ( e.g. Ex. 3: 2, 64, 65, 68; Ex. 7: 22; Tr. 140: 4/3; Tr. 160&hyph;61: 4/3) opposed adding
requirements for bump caps to the final rule because they believe that if head protection is needed, then it would be
safer to require head protection meeting ANSI Z89.1&hyph;1986. For example, a commenter from the American Trucking
Association (Ex. 3: 64, pg. 5) remarked: 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG QTAG 04 -->
<!-- PJG /QTAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=3 -->
For the trucking industry in general, bump caps are not practical. Although they are used in some operations for select
job tasks, the motor carrier industry has found little benefit in reducing minor head injuries through their use.
In fact, safety personnel from a cross section of the nation's motor carriers recently explained that bump caps can
be more of a hinderance than a help; they frequently fall off, and in some instances, they can cause vision obstructions.

OSHA has concluded, based on review of the rulemaking record, that the available data do not support regulatory action
regarding bump caps. Therefore, the Agency will neither restrict the use of bump caps nor set criteria for such use.
OSHA will evaluate an employer's choice of head protection based on the e hazards to which employees may be exposed.
Therefore, the employer's compliance with the requirement for a hazard assessment, in 1910.132(d), is of critical
importance.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Proposed paragraph (a) of this section required employers to ensure that employees wear protective footwear when
working in areas where there is a danger of foot injuries due to falling and rolling objects, or objects piercing the
sole. This proposed provision received a large amount of support from rulemaking participants (e.g. Ex. 3: 49, 59,
64, 67). Many of the rulemaking participants agreed with referencing the American National Standards Institute
(ANSI) standard for personal protection, ANSI Z41&hyph;1983, ``Protective Footwear,'' particularly since this
standard, unlike the superseded 1967 edition, sets criteria for women's footwear and for puncture resistance. However,
two commenters were concerned as to when this protection would be required. A commenter from the American Trucking
Association (ATA) stated (Ex. 3: 64, pp. 4&hyph;5): 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG QTAG 04 -->
<!-- PJG /QTAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->
*&blank;*&blank;* in some operations drivers may be exposed to falling or rolling freight hazards, or other hazards
presented by nails or other sharp objects. In these cases, safety shoes, non-penetrable soles, or some other type
of protective footwear are appropriate. On the other hand, there are thousands of drivers that never handle freight
or come into exposure with falling or rolling freight, sharp objects, or any other number of hazards. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
*&blank;*&blank;* The need to require the equipment must be determined on a case by case basis--taking into account
the specific operations, and the specific tasks and hazards of the various job functions. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG QTAG 04 -->
<!-- PJG /QTAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Another commenter, from the Aluminum Company of America (ALCOA), expressed a similar concern with respect to when
foot protection is required (Ex. 3: 2): 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG QTAG 04 -->
<!-- PJG /QTAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->
Specialty shoes such as ``electrical hazard'' footwear or ``conductive'' shoes have special requirements that
would not permit metal insoles to prevent the puncture. If this requirement is upheld, the current design standards
and performance criteria for electrical hazard shoes could not be met. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG QTAG 04 -->
<!-- PJG /QTAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
OSHA notes that these concerns are addressed by 1910.132(d), as proposed and as promulgated. That provision requires
the employer to perform a hazard assessment. From the hazard assessment, the employer can determine what PPE is needed.
As to the example presented by the ATA, if it is determined through an appropriate hazard assessment that an employee
is not exposed to foot hazards, the employer would not have to provide this type of protection. As discussed above,
the hazard assessment provision allows employers the flexibility to choose the PPE that is appropriate for a particular
workplace situation. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Regarding the ALCOA comment, OSHA notes that if it is determined through a hazard assessment that electrical workers
are not exposed to the hazard of sharp objects puncturing the soles of shoes (which would be the case in many instances),
the protective footwear would not have to provide this type of protection. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
On the other hand, if it is determined through a hazard assessment that employees are exposed both to electrical and
puncture hazards, the employer would be required to ensure that employees wear shoes which protect the employees
from both hazards. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Both the 1983 and 1991 editions of ANSI Z41 set criteria for protection of feet from electrical hazards. While proposed
1910.136(b) required that footwear be designed to either comply with Z41&hyph;1983 or be demonstrated to provide
equivalent protection, proposed 1910.136(a) did not explicitly require that employees wear foot protection against
electrical hazards. The Agency had intended proposed paragraphs (a) and (b) to be consistent and to reflect the 1983
edition of ANSI Z41. While employers are already required to protect employees from electrical hazards under existing
1910.132, OSHA believes that guidance regarding foot protection against electrical hazards will be clearer and
more useful if it appears in 1910.136. OSHA has revised proposed 1910.136(a) accordingly. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In paragraph (b) of 1910.136, OSHA proposed that the design of protective footwear comply with the requirements of
ANSI Z41&hyph;1983, or be of a design which has been demonstrated to be equally effective. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Rulemaking participants (e.g. Ex. 3: 49, 59, 67, 72, 105, 118, 123) supported the adoption of the ANSI standard for
foot protection (ANSI Z41). Further, several commenters (e.g. Ex. 3: 65, 67, 82, 84) suggested that OSHA adopt by reference
the ``updated'' or ``current'' edition of ANSI Z41. For example, Footwear Industries of America (FIA) (Ex. 3: 67,
pg. 2) remarked: 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG QTAG 04 -->
<!-- PJG /QTAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->
FIA therefore agrees with OSHA's proposal to update its personal protective equipment standard for foot protection
to comply with the improvements made in the ANSI standard. The Agency should note, however, that the 1983 version of
the ANSI Z41 standard may soon be replaced by an updated set of industry standards. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
FIA suggests that OSHA may wish to await the 1990 version of ANSI Z41 rather than to incorporate a seven-year old, nearly
outdated standard into 29 C.F.R. 1910.136.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG QTAG 04 -->
<!-- PJG /QTAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The Agency notes that the 1991 edition of the ANSI standard for foot protection has, in fact, replaced the 1983 edition
of ANSI Z41 referenced by OSHA in proposed 1910.136(b). 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
OSHA has determined that it is appropriate to reference the current 1991 edition of ANSI Z41 in 1910.136(b) of the final
rule because that edition imposes essentially the same requirements as the 1983 edition, except that the 1991 edition
provides more specific performance requirements for resistance to compressive forces and standardizes the puncture
resistance testing method. OSHA believes, based on its review of the pertinent ANSI standards and of the protective
footwear currently available, that compliance with the referenced requirements of ANSI Z41&hyph;1991 will not
result in disallowing foot protection that would have complied with the requirements of ANSI Z41&hyph;1983. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
As discussed above, OSHA has determined that it is appropriate to provide explicitly for the continued use of foot
PPE purchased prior to the effective date of the final rule, as long as it complies with the ANSI standard (ANSI Z41.1&hyph;1967)
referenced by existing 1910.136. Therefore, the Agency has redesignated proposed paragraph (b) as paragraph (b)(1)
of the final rule, and has added ``grandfathering'' text in paragraph (b)(2) of the final rule. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
A commenter from the Tennessee Valley Authority (Ex. 3: 79) observed that OSHA proposed to incorporate only the design
requirements of the referenced ANSI standards and not the selection requirements, guidelines, and other general
information contained in the documents. As explained above in the preamble, OSHA acknowledges that the proposal
did not clearly express the Agency's intent to reference the ANSI standards in their entirety and is revising proposed
paragraph (b) accordingly. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The incorporation by reference of the pertinent ANSI standards has been approved by the Office of the Federal Register,
in accordance with the requirements of 5 U.S.C. 552(a) and 1 CFR part 51. Therefore, proposed paragraph (b) has been
revised so that paragraphs (b)(1) and (b)(2) of the final rule reflect that approval and provide the requisite information
regarding access to the text of those ANSI standards.

1910.138 Hand protection. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Issue 5 of the hearing notice (55 FR 3414), requested testimony, comments and information regarding the need for regulation
of additional types of PPE. Specifically, the Agency stated that it was considering the appropriateness of promulgating
requirements for hand protection (gloves) and skin protection (chemical protective clothing). 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Agency's concern with respect to hand protection and chemical protective clothing arose from information contained
in the record (e.g. Ex. 6: 2, 3, 4, 5), which indicates that a large number of employee injuries are occurring due to the
lack of adequate protection from hand and skin hazards. Additionally, neither OSHA or ANSI currently have criteria
for hand protection nor for chemical protective clothing. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
While OSHA received some information pertaining to chemical protective clothing, most of the rulemaking participants
who addressed Issue 5 focused their remarks on gloves. Those rulemaking participants suggested that OSHA provide
performance criteria and test methods for gloves and provide better guidance for the selection of gloves. They stated
that in many instances gloves are not being worn, and when gloves are worn, they are often the wrong type of glove for
the application involved (e.g. Ex. 3: 114; Ex. 7: 33, 38, 42; Ex. 53; Tr. 213&hyph;236: 4/3; Tr. 13&hyph;20: 4/4). 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
For instance, a commenter from the United Steelworkers of America (Ex. 3: 114, pg. 2) said: 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG QTAG 04 -->
<!-- PJG /QTAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->
Protective clothing and gloves: OSHA should also set standards for these items since so many gloves do not work with
some chemicals and last longer with other chemicals.

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG QTAG 04 -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->

Boeing supports the position that additional guidelines related to body and hand protection are necessary in 1910.132.
Such guidelines should provide information on the selection of hand and body PPE based on reported experience and
industry needs. Such guidance would facilitate the acquisition and use of appropriate PPE and eliminate any uncertainty
regarding proper application.

<!-- PJG QTAG 04 -->
<!-- PJG /QTAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->
I go into a lot of plants throughout the country and site visits and the first thing I do is I look at the OSHA 200 log. I see
many cases of occupational dermatitis. My first assumption was these people are not wearing gloves. After further
investigation once I'm in that facility, I find out that the workers are wearing gloves, but they're wearing the wrong
glove for the application involved. So, this really needs to be addressed. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG QTAG 04 -->
<!-- PJG /QTAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The Agency also received some useful information about the various types of gloves and types of hazards for which they
should be used; the composition of the various types of gloves; and, other helpful information (Ex. 3: 27). There were
also some informative studies submitted to the record concerning the hand and skin hazards posed by certain chemicals
(Ex. 42). 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
After careful evaluation of the rulemaking record, OSHA has concluded that the high incidence of hand injuries, together
with evidence that hand protection either is not being worn by employees or is being worn for the wrong type of hazards,
warrants the inclusion of more detailed requirements for selection and wearing of hand protection. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Therefore, a new section, 1910.138, is being added to the final rule to address hand protection. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Paragraph (a) requires that employers select, and that employees use, appropriate hand protection. In addition,
paragraph (a) identifies some of the types of hazards for which hand protection must be worn by employees. These include
hand hazards and potential hand hazards from skin absorption of harmful substances; severe cuts or lacerations;
severe abrasions; punctures; chemical burns; thermal burns; and harmful temperature extremes. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Paragraph (b) addresses the selection of the appropriate type of hand protection for the hazard or potential hazard
that is present at the workplace. The purpose of this provision is to assure that employees are using the appropriate
type of gloves for the tasks to be performed. For example, foundry workers generally must wear gloves that provide
thermal protection, while meat cutters must wear gloves that protect against cuts. While the selection of the appropriate
type of glove for a certain task or hazard may seem to be obvious, the rulemaking record indicates that many hand injuries
have occurred because the wrong type of glove was used for a certain task. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
 Therefore, OSHA has determined that employers need more explicit guidance in determining what hand protection their
employees need. The Agency anticipates that compliance with this provision will assure that employees use the appropriate
type of hand protection for the assigned tasks and the identified hazards. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
OSHA has also added information to Appendix B of the final rule regarding the selection of appropriate hand protection.

Third party certification 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
In the NPRM (54 FR 33835), OSHA solicited comments on whether or not the Agency should require third party certification
of PPE. OSHA indicated that it would consider promulgating such a provision to ensure that PPE meets OSHA standards.
In addition, Issue 2 of the hearing notice (55 FR 3413) solicited testimony, with supporting information, regarding
the extent to which third party certification of PPE required by Subpart I would be appropriate. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The third party certification issue generated more response than any other subject covered by this rulemaking. Many
of the participants in this rulemaking supported third party certification (e.g. Ex. 3: 3, 16, 27, 37, 83, 90, 92, 98,
114, 120, 123; Ex. 7: 3, 18, 20; Tr. 55: 4/3; Tr. 92&hyph;97: 4/3; Tr. 6&hyph;7: 4/4; Ex. 49). 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In supporting third party certification, a commenter from MSA (Ex. 3: 18) stated: 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG QTAG 04 -->
<!-- PJG /QTAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->
In order to provide user companies with assurances that personal protective equipment meets the appropriate standards,
we think it would be highly desirable for OSHA to require third-party certification of PPE. We think a program such
as the one offered by the Safety Equipment Institute that provides independent testing and quality assurance audits
is extremely valuable and adds minimum cost to safety equipment. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
A commenter from ETL Testing Laboratories, Inc. (Ex. 3: 43) added: 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG QTAG 04 -->
<!-- PJG /QTAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->
Our experience supports the use of third-party certification as positive assurance that the products covered by
a program do, in fact, meet the standards to which they are tested, and that follow-up inspections verify that they
continue to meet the requirements. Third-party certification programs offer the user of personal protective equipment
a positive pledge that the product has been designed and manufactured to provide the protection needed. It further
simplifies the selection process by way of readily available lists of complying products and recognizable labels
and marks on them. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Although we are not prepared to give detailed estimates of costs of third-party certification for the various products,
the fees are not burdensome, even on small businesses. The equipment must be tested, whether it is in a program or not;
therefore, that cost is present in either case. The administration of a simple yet effective program with follow-up
factory inspection would probably not exceed $1,500&hyph;2,000 per year per plant based on some similar programs
we operate. Obviously, there are many types of programs, and the fees will vary dependent on the level of services rendered.

SEI's program of periodic quality assurance audits and product testing is now widely accepted by industry and government.

<!-- PJG /QTAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->
We feel that third party certification, akin to that currently required for respiratory protection, should be mandated

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG QTAG 04 -->
<!-- PJG /QTAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->
Whether the third party certification is performed by private or governmental entity, ISEA supports its use as a means
of confirming the quality of products made for the protection of workers. In the absence of government standards and
certification of compliance, ISEA endorses third party certification of compliance with ANSI standard Z87.1, 1989,
and Z89.1, 1986. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
We believe that the additional cost involved for manufacturers of personal protective equipment to obtain certification
is minimal, as is reflected by the number of eye and face protection devices and industrial helmets which are already
certified by the Safety Equipment Institute. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Third party certification costs are averaged over the volume of units sold, and we believe end up as an insignificant
cost increase.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Other rulemaking participants expressed concerns with the concept of third party certification. One concern expressed
by several rulemaking participants (e.g. Ex. 3: 28, 79, 87, 105) was the belief that OSHA envisioned requiring employers,
rather than manufacturers of the PPE, to obtain the third party certification. That was not the Agency's intent. OSHA
notes that the manufacturer of the PPE, not the purchaser/user, is, in general, the party who is in the appropriate
position to have products tested and evaluated. OSHA's intention regarding the duty of employers was to reaffirm
the employer's responsibility to purchase and have employees use only PPE that would meet the requirements of the
pertinent standards. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Rulemaking participants also expressed concern that it would be very difficult to have third party certification
of prescription safety eyewear (e.g. Ex. 3: 60, 71, 93, 115; Ex. 7: 11, 34; Tr. 184&hyph;191: 4/3; Tr. 206: 4/4; Ex. 50).
They asserted that third party certification would not be practical since the eyecare providers and prescription
laboratories, generally small businesses, who produce prescription eyewear would be unable to bear the burden of
third party certification. They also stated that each pair of prescription glasses is unique to the individual for
whom it was prescribed. Those rulemaking participants explained that lenses are tested by the manufacturer to meet
ANSI standards, and frames are tested to meet ANSI standards by the frame manufacturers. Those participants also
expressed the belief that this testing meets the intent of third party certification. OSHA notes that the assurance
provided by such procedures may be even better than that obtained through third party certification because 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
each
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 lens and frame is tested, rather than the representative sample of eyewear that would be tested through a third party
certification program. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
For example, a commenter from the Optical Laboratories Association (OLA), stated (Ex. 3: 71, pp.1&hyph;2): 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG QTAG 04 -->
<!-- PJG /QTAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->
It is the position of OLA that third-party certification of devices utilizing lenses made to individual prescription
(Rx) is not feasible, and in fact would not guarantee the safety-level provided by the present system as prescribed
by Z87. This is so because third-party certification of 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=3 -->
all devices
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->
 would not be practicable, whereas under the present system 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=3 -->
prescription lenses
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->
 are subject to a rigorous test and the fabricator of each lens certifies, by its trademark, that the lens meets the standard.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
It is therefore submitted that the existing system of separate testing of the frame and lenses of spectacles containing
prescription lenses meets OSHA's objectives and is practical. Further testing of the completed device after the
lenses are inserted would not be feasible. While the test may not cause a device failure, it may damage the lenses and
weaken the frame.

We do not believe that this [third party testing of prescription eyewear] is practical. Most industrial eyewear today
[is] prescribed. *&blank;*&blank;* each prescription pair of glasses is unique to the individual for which it was
prescribed and made. The common denominator is that prescription eyewear lenses are 100% tested to pass the industrial
eyewear requirements for primary protection, i.e., impact resistance. Further, frames are tested and marked by
the frame manufacturer to meet the requirements.

Other rulemaking participants opposed third party certification of PPE (e.g. Ex. 3: 65, 68, 99; Ex. 7: 1, 8, 39). For
instance, the belief was expressed (Ex. 3: 119) that the present voluntary system is adequate, particularly in light
of widespread concerns regarding product liability. In general, those opposed to third party certification believed
it would add cost, without adding any appreciable safety benefit. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
For example, a commenter from the American Gas Association (Ex. 3: 46, pg. 13) stated:

<!-- PJG /QTAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->
We urge OSHA not to adopt such a requirement. Such certification would increase unnecessarily the incremental cost
of compliance while providing few, if any, benefits. Manufacturers who claim they are in compliance with the ANSI
standard could be subject to liability in cases where products fail to meet that standard. The cost of third party compliance
would be borne by the industry when the risk of liability should be sufficient to ensure compliance.

Third party certification of personal protective equipment by employers would be both costly to the manufacturer
and, subsequently, the employer. Additionally, it is not clear in the proposal as to how this requirement would enhance
the safety of the workforce. It would place an additional administrative and financial burden on both manufacturers
and employers, which does not seem to be justified.

<!-- PJG QTAG 04 -->
<!-- PJG /QTAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->
MVMA strongly objects to the proposal of requiring third party certification for personal protective equipment.
We believe that personal protective equipment which meets the requirements of various safety standards such as ANSI
and the certification programs conducted by the Safety Equipment Institute are adequate to provide the assurance
that the PPE will meet the performance specifications necessary to protect an employee. To require a third party certification
will be redundant, costly and will not enhance the safety or performance of PPE.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->
[W]e question whether third party certification will add any benefits in terms of protection for employees. It will
certainly add to the cost of such equipment. We believe that the manufacturers' written statement that their equipment
meets the requirements of the appropriate ANSI standard should be sufficient. Our perception is that this arrangement
has worked well over the years and we see no benefit in changing it. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG QTAG 04 -->
<!-- PJG /QTAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
OSHA has carefully considered this issue and, after a thorough evaluation of all of the information contained in the
record, has concluded for several reasons, that it would not be appropriate to require third party certification.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
First, while OSHA has recognized that third party certification of PPE can increase confidence in and use of PPE, a
requirement for such third party certification will not add to the inherent safety of the PPE tested and certified.
Also, given the extent to which the PPE industry has already voluntarily adopted third party certification, the Agency
believes that any benefit resulting from the addition of such a requirement would be minimal. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Furthermore, revised subpart I provides other means to determine if PPE meets the pertinent standard. In particular,
compliance with revised subpart I's performance-oriented requirements for hazard assessment, PPE selection,
and training will result in appropriate selection, use and maintenance of PPE by affected employees. For example,
the Agency expects that the training required in new 1910.132(f) will increase affected employee confidence in the
assigned PPE and, as a consequence, increase the use of PPE. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Also, OSHA believes, given the limited benefit expected from third party certification, that it would be unreasonable
to require that employers procure only PPE that has third party certification. Such a requirement would impose unnecessary
burdens on PPE manufacturers who can establish by other means that their products comply with the pertinent OSHA standards.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In addition, the Agency believes that allocating the resources needed to implement and enforce a requirement for
third party certification would unreasonably detract from OSHA's ability to enforce the other provisions of revised
subpart I. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Agency is also adding non-mandatory appendices A and B to provide additional guidance to employers and employees
with regard to PPE for eye, face, head, foot, and hand hazards.

IV. Regulatory Impact, Regulatory Flexibility and Environmental Assessment of Revisions to Subpart I, Personal
Protective Equipment 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 -->
Introduction 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
In 1971, OSHA adopted its current standards for personal protective equipment (PPE) from national consensus standards
under section 6(a) of the OSH Act. Since then, advances in PPE technology have resulted in greater occupational protection
in workplaces where equipment innovations have been adopted. In this final rule, OSHA promulgates a nationwide standard
for PPE that reflects these improved means of hazard prevention. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Executive Order 12866 (58 FR 51735) requires that a Regulatory Impact Analysis be prepared for any ``significant
regulatory action''. A ``significant'' rule would have an annual effect on the economy of $100 million or more or adversely
affect in a material way the economy, a sector of the economy, productivity, competition, jobs, the environment,
public health or safety, or state, local or tribal governments or communities. In addition, the Regulatory Flexibility
Act (5 U.S.C. 601, et seq.) requires an analysis of whether a regulation will have a significant economic impact on
a substantial number of small entities. Finally, section 6(f) of the Occupational Safety and Health Act provides
that, where a party has challenged the validity of an OSHA standard in the Court of Appeals, the determinations of OSHA
(such as findings regarding the nature and severity of workplace hazards and the feasibility of identified abatement
measures) shall be conclusive if supported by substantial evidence in the record considered as a whole. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
OSHA determined, based on the Agency's Preliminary Regulatory Impact Analysis [1] and its review of the rulemaking
record, that the final rule for General Industry PPE is not a ``significant regulatory action'' for the purposes of
review under Executive Order 12866. However, in order to satisfy the various statutory requirements placed upon
the Agency and to further explain why OSHA has classified this regulatory action as ``non-significant'' for Executive
Order 12866 purposes, OSHA presents this Final Regulatory Impact, Regulatory Flexibility and Environmental Impact
Assessment.

Industry Profile 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Based on a report prepared by Eastern Research Group under contract to the Department of Labor [2], OSHA has determined
that the hazards addressed by the personal protective equipment standard are present in varying degrees in virtually
all workplaces covered by the OSHA General Industry standards (29 CFR 1910). The extent of the rule's impact will vary
by industry depending on the hazards, the types of occupational activity and current practices regarding PPE use.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Many types of PPE have been in widespread use in industry for many years. However, until recently very little statistical
data existed to determine the number of employees who either are using PPE or who should be wearing PPE by virtue of the
hazards to which they are exposed. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
OSHA's inspection data document that approximately 3.5 percent of all planned safety inspections result in citations
under the existing PPE standards. The inspection data identifies the standard industrial classification (SIC)
of the establishment, size of plant workforce, union status, and information related to the inspection itself; less
frequently reported are data on degree of hazard present in workplaces, the number of workers exposed to the hazard,
or the type of PPE required. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In its Preliminary Regulatory Impact Analysis [1], OSHA examined injury statistics for affected industry sectors.
Among the accident databases searched by OSHA were Work Injury Reports (WIR) published by the Bureau of Labor Statistics
(BLS). These reports examine cases where a worker was injured and provide evidence that many workers are not wearing
adequate personal protective equipment. Based on the BLS data, relatively few firms with serious recordable injury
cases have performed a formal assessment of the potential hazards in their workplace. In addition, little training
was offered to workers regarding the importance of using protective equipment in these firms. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
To obtain accurate information on the need for personal protective equipment and the extent to which that need is being
met, OSHA conducted a national survey in 1989 [3,4,5]. The survey sampled 5,361 establishments, representing 1.1
million establishments in 61 SIC groups. The survey identified the hazards related to industrial processes and the
types of PPE required when working in or near these processes. The survey solicited information on PPE practices and
safety procedures and assessed whether engineering controls such as protective guards or overhead nets were in place.
Answers to survey questions were used to evaluate the appropriateness of PPE use. Survey questions also addressed
PPE training and hazard assessment. (See the background document and appendices in this docket for more detailed
information on the survey and supporting data related to this analysis.) 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Table 1 shows the major industry groups covered by the PPE standard, the total number of affected establishments,
total affected employment, number of production employees and number of employees exposed to PPE-related hazards.
Of the 16.9 million production workers, the survey identified 11.7 million exposed workers within 1.1 million establishments
who should be wearing some form of PPE. These numbers are lower than was indicated in the PRIA, due to a refinement in
the analysis regarding affected population. Occupational categories identified by OSHA as having a significant
degree of required PPE use include craft, operating, maintenance and material handling employees. These categories
encompass most production employees and are most likely to be affected by this standard. However, as noted in the PRIA
[1, p. II&hyph;2&hyph;4], OSHA has previously estimated over a million other workers may also be exposed to hazards
requiring PPE use in the rest of general industry

As was indicated in the PRIA, while all general industry workers are potentially affected by these standards, exposed
workers are heavily concentrated in certain occupations and in certain industries. Building upon information provided
for the PRIA and comments to the record, this final analysis focuses on those groups of workers and industries judged
to have a heavy concentration of PPE use. In this analysis population at risk was determined by survey results indicating
a hazard that required the use of PPE. The PRIA had used the term ``population at risk'' to refer to all workers in two
``production worker'' job categories in general industry [1, p. II&hyph;1&hyph;5]. It should be noted that this
analysis in no way implies that other workers may not be exposed to hazards preventable by PPE, but simply that the great
majority are found in certain specific job categories and industries.

From survey results OSHA developed a profile of the affected population by exposed bodily area (anatomical part),
summarized in Table 2. As the table shows, almost 8.8 million workers are exposed to foot injury, while the potential
for hand injury exists for 4.7 million workers. Other anatomical parts covered by this rule are eyes (2.8 million workers
at risk), head (1.9 million workers) and face (381,000 workers).

Technological Feasibility 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The existing and revised standards for subpart I require personal protective equipment wherever necessary by reason
of the hazards of processes, environment or worker activity. New 1910.132(d) requires workplace hazard assessment
and new 1910.132(f) requires employee training in the use of PPE. The revised standards for eye and face protection,
protective headwear and foot protection update, prospectively, references to pertinent consensus standards.
OSHA expects that employers will be able to comply with the new and revised requirements without difficulty, because
the means of compliance are readily available and because the final rule ``grandfathers'' equipment that complies
with the existing standards. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
OSHA anticipates that the new requirements for hazard assessment, prohibition of defective and damaged equipment,
and employee training can be implemented with available technical personnel and other resources. OSHA's survey
probed the extent to which firms have already adopted the elements of a PPE program. Comments in the record were also
evaluated in order to establish current industry practices. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
On the basis of evidence in the record, including results from the OSHA PPE survey, OSHA has determined that the final
PPE standard is both technologically and economically feasible.

Costs of Compliance 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
OSHA estimated compliance costs using data on current practices and exposed population from the PPE survey. Aggregating
costs across industry sectors, OSHA estimates a total annual compliance cost of new provisions in the revised rule
will result in a cost of $52.4 million. Total compliance costs by industry sector are presented in Table 3.

OSHA's survey identified 433,149 establishments which need to take steps to come into compliance with the new provisions
for hazard assessment. (Of 825,265 affected establishments, approximately 47 percent already had a hazard assessment
program in place.) The cost to conduct hazard assessments was estimated to be $15.9 million per year, assuming a reassessment
is conducted once every five years. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The new provision for PPE training would affect approximately 10.8 million employees estimated in need of PPE training,
at an annual cost of $36.5 million. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Estimates for the cost of providing PPE training differ from those in Preliminary Regulatory Impact Analysis due
to comments received and results from OSHA's PPE survey. This information indicated that the problem of PPE non-usage
is considerably more widespread than originally estimated. Correspondingly, this indicated that the population
requiring PPE training was larger than originally estimated.

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
OSHA believes that the risk of fatality and injury to workers is unacceptably high among sectors affected by the revised
personal protective equipment standard. The revised PPE standard is designed to enhance compliance with existing
requirements and ensure future compliance related to a heightened level of hazard awareness and training. These
changes to the standard should help to eliminate or reduce accidents within industries subject to the rule. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The standard has performance-oriented provisions addressing eye, face, hand, head and foot hazards that allow employers
to adopt the most up-to-date PPE for use in their establishment. The flexibility to substitute new materials and technologies
should produce more comfortable and protective PPE. An increase in worker acceptance and use of PPE should translate
into additional benefits. OSHA's expectation is that increased use of better equipment will prevent or lessen the
severity of many incidents.

According to BLS statistics in 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Occupational Injuries and Illnesses in the United States by Industry, 1989
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 [6], there were a total of 1.6 million lost-workday cases and 1.8 million non-lost-workday cases during the survey
year. Eastern Research Group [7] analyzed survey-related data, which were used to extract the number of these injuries
that were related to use (or nonuse) of PPE. In turn, BLS Work Injury Reports were analyzed to estimate what portion
of those injuries related to inconsistent or inappropriate use of PPE, or lack of hazard identification. Injuries
prevented in significantly affected industry sectors are shown in Table 4. Since injuries will be prevented in some
other industry sectors as well, total estimates are conservative.

OSHA estimates that 712,000 lost workdays&sect;
<FOOTCITE>2</FOOTCITE>
 and 65,000 non-lost workday cases will be realized from compliance with requirements for employee training and workplace
hazard assessment. These benefits will be gained through selection of more appropriate PPE, increased awareness
of hazards and improved consistency in use. These benefit estimates exceed those of the PRIA because OSHA has determined
that current compliance with the PPE standards is poorer than was estimated in the PRIA. In addition, OSHA believes
these requirements will enhance compliance with existing requirements, thereby preventing more injuries; however,
the extent of these benefits are difficult to quantify.

Recent research by Arthur Oleinick identifies a possible underestimation of lost workdays when reference periods
are bounded by calendar years, as in the BLS survey. For elaboration of this point, see Oleinick [8].

OSHA also estimated the number of fatalities associated with the absence of personal protective equipment. From
an analysis of BLS, NIOSH and OSHA accident data, OSHA estimates that 125 fatal head injuries occur annually. While
most fatal head injuries are the result of crushing injuries, falls, explosions and other traumatic events beyond
the scope of this standard, some are preventable with the use of head protection. Based on a review of OSHA accident
abstracts and an understanding of the rule's scope and effectiveness, OSHA estimates that 4 head injury fatality
cases are preventable each year through compliance with the new provisions of the standard.

Based upon these estimated reduction in injuries, OSHA estimates that society will reap substantial economic benefits
from prevented injuries. Lost work time injuries can be particularly expensive.

PPE is uniquely effective in preventing eye injuries, for example, which can be severely debilitating. Dr. Leonard
Parver [9, pp. 28&hyph;29] of Georgetown University's ophthalmology department elaborated on this cost to employers:

These injuries tend to be very devastating. They have severe impact on the patient in terms of vision, and the costs
are phenomenal. We estimate the costs of hospitalizing these patients at $250 million per year. That's just for the
hospital stay; that doesn't include lost work days and compensation costs. This is a very significant problem, and
very, very preventable. We're not talking about reinventing the wheel here. We have the means of doing this. We have
adequate eye protective gear. It's a matter of educating the workforce that this is necessary.

While employers typically bear only a fraction of the costs related to injuries, these costs can be substantial. Employers
specifically will benefit from reduced lost production time, administrative time spent preparing insurance claims
and accident reports and replacing injured workers. Based on a 1981 study by Levitt and coworkers [10], OSHA estimates
the cost to employers from the average lost worktime injury is at least $4000
<FOOTCITE>3</FOOTCITE>
. This cost includes:

Levitt's wage rates were adjusted to reflect current wage conditions in general industry [11]. In light of the National
Safety Council estimates presented later in this document, given the debilitating severity of many PPE accidents
(eye, head), and the surge in workers compensation costs in recent years, an estimate of $4000 per injury is likely
to be conservative.

Other nonquantifiable costs associated with accidents, such as increased anxiety among non-injured workers, the
loss of employee goodwill towards the employer, and the impact on public perception of a company and its products were
not considered in the Levitt study. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Based on the Levitt study and the estimated 37,924 lost workdays prevented, OSHA estimates that the rule will save
firms over $150 million annually. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
However, as noted above, the cost of workplace injuries is typically borne primarily by employees themselves. The
National Safety Council recently calculated the societal cost per lost worktime injury at $27,000 [7,p. 35], by factoring
in long-term wage losses, medical expenses, administrative expenses and miscellaneous employer costs. Applying
this figure to OSHA's estimate of 37,924 lost workday injuries prevented annually, revisions to this rule should
save society (employees, employers and third parties) over $1 billion annually. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
These estimates of the economic benefits of the rule may be conservative, since the benefits analysis focuses on injuries
prevented, not reduced severity of injuries. To the extent the rule results in nonlost workday injuries, as opposed
to disabling lost workday injuries, the economic benefits may be greater yet. In sum, OSHA estimates the rule will
save society over $1 billion annually, dwarfing the initial $52 million investment. Employers themselves should
save over $150 million through full compliance with revisions to the PPE standard, approximately three times the
estimated cost of compliance.

Economic Impact and Regulatory Flexibility Analysis 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
OSHA analyzed the potential economic impact of the revised PPE standard and has determined that none of the major industry
groups subject to the standard would experience a significant economic burden as a result of compliance, even before
cost savings to employers are factored in. Table 5 presents average compliance cost, revenue, profit, and economic
impacts of the standard for establishments in affected industry groups. If all of the compliance costs are passed
through to the consumer, OSHA estimates that the average price increase would be negligible, less than 0.001 percent,
calculated as the ratio of total compliance cost to industry sales. The maximum price increase in any industry would
be less than 0.005 percent. Given the minuscule price increases necessary to cover these safety investments, employers
should be able to pass along compliance costs to their customers. However, even if all costs were absorbed by the affected
firms, the average reduction in profits would be approximately 0.01 percent, the largest being 0.06 percent. OSHA,
therefore, does not expect the revised standard to have a significant economic impact on affected firms or industries

In the Preliminary Regulatory Impact Analysis [1], OSHA analyzed the entire spectrum of affected industries, and
had determined no significant economic impact would result on establishments on any industry, with substantially
less impact in those establishments without heavy PPE use. This determination was reached even though the PRIA included
costs not directly attributable to the proposal, resulting in a total cost estimate which was nearly twice the cost
estimated in this final analysis. Accordingly, OSHA reaffirms that establishments in those industries will incur
minimal economic impact.

), OSHA also analyzed the economic impact on small establishments (19 or fewer employees), looking particularly
for signs that the rule would pose excessive burdens per employee, relative to impacts faced by larger entities. OSHA
has determined that, in relation to compliance with the standard, equipment purchases and labor utilization will
to a great extent depend positively on size of workforce; smaller firms are not expected to incur relatively higher
costs per worker. As shown in Table 6, OSHA estimates that the average price impact for small establishments will be
0.002 percent, while profit impacts will not exceed 0.04 percent under the assumption that all compliance costs are
absorbed by firms. These impacts are judged to be relatively minor; therefore, the PPE standard is economically feasible
for small establishments.

The revisions to the PPE standard have been reviewed in accordance with the requirements of the National Environmental
Policy Act of 1969 (42 U.S.C. 4321, et seq.), the regulations of the Council on Environmental Quality (40 CFR part 1500
through 1517), and the Department of Labor's NEPA procedures (29 CFR part 11). As a result of this review, OSHA has determined
that the new PPE standard will have no significant environmental impact.

A. Introduction 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->

from those hazards in Section I,

Summary and Explanation of the Final Rule
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
, above. The Agency is providing the following discussion of the statutory mandate for OSHA rulemaking activity to
explain the legal basis for its determination that the revised PPE standard, as promulgated, is reasonably necessary
to protect affected employees from significant risks of injury and death. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Section 2(b)(3) of the Occupational Safety and Health Act authorizes ``the Secretary of Labor to set mandatory 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
occupational safety and health standards
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 applicable to businesses affecting interstate commerce'', and section 5(a)(2) provides that ``[e]ach employer
shall comply with 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
occupational safety and health standards
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 promulgated under this Act'' (emphasis added). Section 3(8) of the OSH Act (29 U.S.C.  652(8)) provides that ``the
term 'occupational safety and health standard' means a standard which requires conditions, or the adoption or use
of one or more practices, means, methods, operations, or processes, reasonably necessary or appropriate to provide
safe or healthful employment and places of employment.'' 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In two recent cases, reviewing courts have expressed concern that OSHA's interpretation of these provisions of the
OSH Act, particularly of section 3(8) as it pertains to safety rulemaking, could lead to overly costly or under-protective
safety standards. In 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
International Union, UAW v. OSHA
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
, 938 F.2d 1310 (D.C. Cir. 1991), the District of Columbia Circuit rejected substantive challenges to OSHA's lockout/tagout
standard and denied a request that enforcement of that standard be stayed, but it also expressed concern that OSHA's
interpretation of the OSH Act could lead to safety standards that are very costly and only minimally protective. In

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
National Grain &amp; Feed Ass'n v. OSHA
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
, 866 F.2d 717 (5th Cir. 1989), the Fifth Circuit concluded that Congress gave OSHA considerable discretion in structuring
the costs and benefits of safety standards but, concerned that the grain dust standard might be under-protective,
directed OSHA to consider adding a provision that might further reduce significant risk of fire and explosion. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
OSHA rulemakings involve a significant degree of agency expertise and policy-making discretion to which reviewing
courts must defer. (See for example, 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Building &amp; Constr. Trades Dep't, AFL-CIO v. Brock
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
, 838 F.2d 1258, 1266 (D.C. Cir. 1988); 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Industrial Union Dep't, AFL-CIO v. American Petroleum Inst.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
, 448 U.S. 607, 655 n. 62 (1980).) At the same time, the agency's technical expertise and policy-making authority must
be exercised within discernable parameters. The lockout/tagout and grain handling standard decisions sought clarification
of the agency's view of the scope of its expertise and authority. In light of those decisions, the preamble to this safety
standard states OSHA's views regarding the limits of its safety rulemaking authority and explains why the Agency
is confident that its interpretive views have in the past avoided regulatory extremes and continue to do so in this
rule. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Stated briefly, the OSH Act requires that, before promulgating any occupational safety standard, OSHA demonstrate
based on substantial evidence in the record as a whole that: (1) the proposed standard will substantially reduce a
significant risk of material harm; (2) compliance is technologically feasible in the sense that the protective measures
being required already exist, can be brought into existence with available technology, or can be created with technology
that can reasonably be developed; (3) compliance is economically feasible in the sense that industry can absorb or
pass on the costs without major dislocation or threat of instability; and (4) the standard is cost effective in that
it employs the least expensive protective measures capable of reducing or eliminating significant risk. Additionally,
proposed safety standards must be compatible with prior agency action, must be responsive to significant comment
in the record, and, to the extent allowed by statute, must be consistent with applicable Executive Orders. These elements
limit OSHA's regulatory discretion for safety rulemaking and provide a decision-making framework for developing
a rule. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 -->
B. Congress concluded that OSHA regulations are necessary to protect workers from occupational hazards and that
employers should be required to reduce or eliminate significant workplace health and safety threats. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
At section 2(a) of the OSH Act (29 U.S.C.  651(a)), Congress announced its determination that occupational injury
and illness should be eliminated as much as possible: ``The Congress finds that occupational injury and illness arising
out of work situations impose a substantial burden upon, and are a hindrance to, interstate commerce in terms of lost
production, wage loss, medical expenses, and disability compensation payments.'' Congress therefore declared
``it to be its purpose and policy *&blank;*&blank;* to assure so far as possible every working man and woman in the Nation
safe *&blank;*&blank;* working conditions [29 U.S.C.  651(b)].'' 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
To that end, Congress instructed the Secretary of Labor to adopt existing federal and consensus standards during
the first two years after the OSH Act became effective and, in the event of conflict among any such standards, to ``promulgate
the standard which assures the greatest protection of the safety or health of the affected employees [29 U.S.C.  655(a)].''
Congress also directed the Secretary to set mandatory occupational safety standards [29 U.S.C.  651(b)(3)], based
on a rulemaking record and substantial evidence [29 U.S.C.  655(b)(2)], that are ``reasonably necessary or appropriate
to provide safe *&blank;*&blank;* employment and places of employment.'' When promulgating permanent safety or
health standards that differ from existing national consensus standards, the Secretary must explain ``why the rule
as adopted will better effectuate the purposes of this Act than the national consensus standard [29 U.S.C.  655(b)(8)].''
Correspondingly, every employer must comply with OSHA standards and, in addition, ``furnish to each of his employees
employment and a place of employment which are free from recognized hazards that are causing or are likely to cause
death or serious physical harm to his employees [29 U.S.C.  654(a)].'' 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
``Congress understood that the Act would create substantial costs for employers, yet intended to impose such costs
when necessary to create a safe and healthful working environment. Congress viewed the costs of health and safety
as a cost of doing business*&blank;*&blank;*. Indeed, Congress thought that the 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

[T]he vitality of the Nation's economy will be enhanced by the greater productivity realized through saved lives
and useful years of labor. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
When one man is injured or disabled by an industrial accident or disease, it is he and his family who suffer the most immediate
and personal loss. However, that tragic loss also affects each of us. As a result of occupational accidents and disease,
over $1.5 billion in wages is lost each year [1970 dollars], and the annual loss to the gross national product is estimated
to be over $8 billion. Vast resources that could be available for productive use are siphoned off to pay workmen's compensation
and medical expenses*&blank;*&blank;*.

Congress considered uniform enforcement crucial because it would reduce or eliminate the disadvantage that a conscientious
employer might experience where inter-industry or intra-industry competition is present. Moreover, ``many employers
-- particularly smaller ones -- simply cannot make the necessary investment in health and safety, and survive competitively,
unless all are compelled to do so [Leg. Hist. at 144, 854, 1188, 1201].'' 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Thus, the statutory text and legislative history make clear that Congress conclusively determined that OSHA regulation
is necessary to protect workers from occupational hazards and that employers should be required to reduce or eliminate
significant workplace health and safety threats. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 -->
C. As construed by the courts and by OSHA, the OSH Act sets clear and reasonable limits for agency rulemaking action.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
OSHA has long followed the teaching that section 3(8) of the OSH Act requires that, before it promulgates ``
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
any
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 permanent health or safety standard, [it must] make a threshold finding that a place of employment is unsafe -- in the
sense that significant risks are present and can be eliminated or lessened by a change in practices [
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Industrial Union Dep't, AFL-CIO v. American Petroleum Inst.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Benzene
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
); emphasis was supplied in original].'' Thus, the national consensus and existing federal standards that Congress
instructed OSHA to adopt summarily within two years of the OSH Act's inception provide reference points concerning
the least an OSHA standard should achieve (29 U.S.C.  655(a)). As a result, OSHA is precluded from regulating insignificant
safety risks or from issuing safety standards that do not at least lessen risk in a significant way. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The OSH Act also limits OSHA's discretion to issue overly burdensome rules, as the agency also has long recognized
that ``any standard that was not economically or technologically feasible would 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
a fortiori
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 not be `reasonably necessary or appropriate' under the Act. See 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Industrial Union Dep't v. Hodgson
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
, [499 F.2d 467, 478 (D.C. Cir. 1974)] (`Congress does not appear to have intended to protect employees by putting their
employers out of business.') [

American Textile Mfrs. Inst. Inc.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
, 452 U.S. at 513 n. 31 (a standard is economically feasible even if it portends `disaster for some marginal firms,'
but it is economically infeasible if it `threaten[s] massive dislocation to, or imperil[s] the existence of,' the
industry)].'' 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
By stating the test in terms of ``threat'' and ``peril,'' the Supreme Court made clear in 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
ATMI
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 that economic infeasibility begins short of industry-wide bankruptcy. OSHA itself has placed the line considerably
below this level. (See for example, 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
ATMI
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
, 452 U.S. at 527 n. 50; 43 FR 27, 360 (June 23, 1978). Proposed 200 &mu;g/m3 PEL for cotton dust did not raise serious possibility
of industry-wide bankruptcy, but impact on weaving sector would be severe, possibly requiring reconstruction of
90 percent of all weave rooms. OSHA concluded that the 200 &mu;g/m3 level was not feasible for weaving and that 750 &mu;g/m3
was all that could reasonably be required). See also 54 FR 29, 245&hyph;246 (July 11, 1989);

, 939 F.2d at 1003. OSHA raised engineering control level for lead in small nonferrous foundries to avoid the possibility
of bankruptcy for about half of small foundries even though the industry as a whole could have survived the loss of small
firms.) 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
All OSHA standards must also be cost-effective in the sense that the protective measures being required must be the
least expensive measures capable of achieving the desired end (

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
, 838 F.2d 1258, 1269 (D.C. Cir. 1988)). OSHA gives additional consideration to financial impact in setting the period
of time that should be allowed for compliance, allowing as much as ten years for compliance phase-in. (See 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
, 453 U.S. 913 (1981).) Additionally, OSHA's enforcement policy takes account of financial hardship on an individualized
basis. OSHA's Field Operations Manual provides that, based on an employer's economic situation, OSHA may extend
the period within which a violation must be corrected after issuance of a citation (CPL. 2.45B, Chapter III, paragraph
E6d(3)(a), Dec. 31, 1990). 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
To reach the necessary findings and conclusions, OSHA conducts rulemaking in accordance with the requirements of
section 6 of the OSH Act. The rulemaking process enables the Agency to determine the qualitative and, if possible,
the quantitative nature of the risk with (and without) regulation, the technological feasibility of compliance,
the availability of capital to the industry and the extent to which that capital is required for other purposes, the
industry's profit history, the industry's ability to absorb costs or pass them on to the consumer, the impact of higher
costs on demand, and the impact on competition with substitutes and imports. (See

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 generally.) Section 6(f) of the OSH Act further provides that, if the validity of a standard is challenged, OSHA must
support its conclusions with ``substantial evidence in the record considered as a whole,'' a standard that courts
have determined requires fairly close scrutiny of agency action and the explanation of that action. (See

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
, 647 F.2d at 1206&hyph;1207.) 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
OSHA's powers are further circumscribed by the independent Occupational Safety and Health Review Commission, which
provides a neutral forum for employer contests of citations issued by OSHA for noncompliance with health and safety
standards (29 U.S.C.  659&hyph;661; noted as an additional constraint in 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Benzene
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 at 652 n. 59). OSHA must also respond rationally to similarities and differences among industries or industry sectors.
(See 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Building and Constr. Trades Dep't, AFL-CIO v. Brock
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
, 838 F.2d 1258, 1272&hyph;73 (D.C. Cir. 1988).) 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
OSHA rulemaking is thus constrained first by the need to demonstrate that the standard will substantially reduce
a significant risk of material harm, and then by the requirement that compliance is technologically capable of being
done and not so expensive as to threaten economic instability or dislocation for the industry. Within these bounds,
further constraints such as the need to find cost-effective measures and to respond rationally to all meaningful
comment militate against regulatory extremes. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 -->
D. The revised PPE standard complies with the statutory criteria described above and is not subject to the additional
constraints applicable to section 6(b)(5) standards. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Standards which regulate hazards that are frequently undetectable because they are subtle or develop slowly or after
long latency periods, are frequently referred to as ``health'' standards. Standards that regulate hazards, like
explosions or electrocution, that cause immediately noticeable physical harm, are called ``safety'' standards.
(See 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
National Grain &amp; Feed Ass'n v. OSHA (NGFA II)
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
, 866 F.2d 717, 731, 733 (5th Cir. 1989). As noted above, section 3(8) provides that 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
all
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 OSHA standards must be ``reasonably necessary or appropriate.'' In addition, section 6(b)(5) requires that OSHA
set health standards which limit significant risk ``to the extent feasible.'' OSHA has determined that the revised
PPE standard is a safety standard, because the revised PPE standard addresses hazards, such as molten metal, falling
objects and electricity, that are immediately dangerous to life or health, not the longer term, less obvious hazards
subject to section 6(b)(5). 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The OSH Act and its legislative history clearly indicate that Congress intended for OSHA to distinguish between safety
standards and health standards. For example in section 2(b)(6) of the OSH Act, Congress declared that the goal of assuring
safe and healthful working conditions and preserving human resources would be achieved, in part: 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG QTAG 04 -->
<!-- PJG /QTAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->
*&blank;*&blank;*  by exploring ways to discover latent diseases, establishing causal connections between diseases
and work in environmental conditions, and conducting other research relating to health problems, in recognition
of the fact that occupational health standards present problems often different from those involved in occupational
safety. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG QTAG 04 -->
<!-- PJG /QTAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->

[The Secretary] should take into account that anyone working in toxic agents and physical agents which might be harmful
may be subjected to such conditions for the rest of his working life, so that we can get at something which might not be
toxic now, if he works in it a short time, but if he works in it the rest of his life might be very dangerous; and we want to
make sure that such things are taken into consideration in establishing standards. [

In reviewing OSHA rulemaking activity, the Supreme Court has held that section 6(b)(5) requires OSHA to set ``the
most protective standard consistent with feasibility'' (

The reason that Congress drafted a special section for these substances *&blank;*&blank;* was because Congress
recognized that there were special problems in regulating health risks as opposed to safety risks. In the latter case,
the risks are generally immediate and obvious, while in the former, the risks may not be evident until a worker has been
exposed for long periods of time to particular substances. [

Challenges to the grain dust and lockout/tagout standards included assertions that grain dust in explosive quantities
and uncontrolled energy releases that could expose employees to crushing, cutting, burning or explosion hazards
were harmful physical agents so that OSHA was required to apply the criteria of section 6(b)(5) when determining how
to protect employees from those hazards. Reviewing courts have uniformly rejected such assertions. For example,
the Court in 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
International Union, UAW v. OSHA
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
, 938 F.2d 1310 (D.C. Cir. 1991) rejected the view that section 6(b)(5) provided the statutory criteria for regulation
of uncontrolled energy, holding that such a ``reading would obliterate a distinction that Congress drew between
`health' and `safety' risks.'' The Court also noted that the language of the OSH Act and the legislative history supported
the OSHA position (
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
International Union, UAW
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 at 1314). Additionally, the Court stated: ``We accord considerable weight to an agency's construction of a statutory
scheme it is entrusted to administer, rejecting it only if unreasonable'' (

The Court reviewing the grain dust standard also deferred to OSHA's reasonable view that the Agency was not subject
to the feasibility mandate of section 6(b)(5) in regulating explosive quantities of grain dust (

, above, OSHA has determined that the non-use or misuse of appropriate PPE poses significant risks to employees and
that the provisions of the final rule are reasonably necessary to protect affected employees from those risks. The
Agency estimates that compliance with the revised PPE standard will cost $52.4 million annually and will reduce the
risk of the identified hazards (preventing 4 fatalities and 102,000 injuries annually). This constitutes a substantial
reduction of significant risk of material harm for the exposed population of approximately 22 million general industry
employees. The Agency believes that compliance is technologically feasible because the rulemaking record indicates
that the PPE required by the standard is already in general use throughout the industries covered by the standard.
Additionally, OSHA believes that compliance is economically feasible, because, as documented in the Regulatory
Impact Analysis, all regulated sectors can readily absorb or pass on compliance costs during the standard's first
five years, and economic benefits will exceed compliance costs thereafter.

OSHA assessed employee risk by evaluating exposure to PPE-related hazards in a large range of industries. The 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Summary of the Final Regulatory Impact Analysis and Regulatory Flexibility Analysis
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
, Section IV, above, presents OSHA's estimate of the costs and benefits of the revised PPE standard in terms of the Standard
Industrial Classification (SIC) codes for the industries regulated. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Agency acknowledges that some industries covered by the revised PPE standard have more documented PPE-related
injuries or fatalities than do others. However, the record indicates that the hazards addressed by the standard exist
throughout general industry. OSHA does not believe that the significance of the risk associated with exposure to
PPE-related hazards within a given SIC classification is dependent on the number of incidents documented for that
particular industry sector. OSHA has set the scope of the revised PPE standard to address those situations where employees
are exposed to PPE-related hazards, regardless of the relative frequency of incidents. The Agency believes, based
on analysis of the elements of the hazards identified, there is sufficient information for OSHA to determine that
employees in the covered sectors face significant risks related to the non-use or misuse of PPE. Therefore, the Agency
has determined that all employees within the scope of the revised PPE standard face a significant risk of material
harm and that compliance with the revised PPE standard is reasonably necessary to protect affected employees from
that risk, regardless of the number of injuries or fatalities reported for the SIC code to which the employer has been
assigned. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In order to facilitate data analysis, OSHA has organized the pertinent injury and fatality information according
to the SIC code for the particular industry sectors where incidents have been reported. Given the limitations of the
OSHA database and the likelihood of misclassification (due, for example, to the difficulty of classifying contractors),
the Agency does not believe that the risks associated with the use or misuse of PPE vary according to the SIC code to which
employers have been assigned. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
OSHA has considered and responded to all substantive comments regarding the proposed PPE standard on their merits
in the Section III, 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Summary and Explanation of the Standard
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
, earlier in this preamble. In particular, OSHA evaluated all suggested changes to the proposed rule in terms of their
impact on worker safety, their feasibility, their cost effectiveness, and their consonance with the OSH Act. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 -->
VI. Federalism 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
This regulation has been reviewed in accordance with Executive Order No. 12612 (52 FR 41685, October 30, 1987), regarding
Federalism. Section 18 of the Occupational Safety and Health Act (OSH Act) preempts state laws relating to issues
on which Federal OSHA has promulgated occupational safety and health standards. Under the OSH Act, a State can avoid
preemption in issues covered by Federal standards only if it submits, and obtains Federal approval of, a plan for the
development of such standards and their enforcement. Occupational safety and health standards developed by such
Plan States must, among other things, be at least as effective in providing safe and healthful employment and places
of employment as the Federal standards. Where such standards are applicable to products distributed or used in interstate
commerce they may not unduly burden commerce and must be justified by compelling local conditions. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Federal standard for personal protective equipment used in general industry addresses hazards that are not unique
to any one State or region of the country. Nonetheless, States with occupational safety and health plans approved
under section 18 of the OSH Act will be able to develop their own State standards to deal with any special problems which
might be encountered in a particular State. Moreover, because this standard is written in general, performance-oriented
terms, there is considerable flexibility for State plans to require, and for affected employers to use, methods of
compliance which are appropriate to the working conditions covered by the standard. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In brief, this final rule addresses a clear national problem related to occupational safety and health in general
industry. Those States which have elected to participate under section 18 of the OSH Act are not preempted by this standard,
and will be able to address any special conditions within the framework of the Federal Act, while ensuring that the
State standards are at least as effective as that standard. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 -->
VII. State Plan States 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The 25 States and territories with their own OSHA approved occupational safety and health plans must develop a comparable
standard applicable to both the private and public (state and local government employees) sectors within six months
of the publication date of a permanent final Federal rule or show OSHA why there is no need for action, e.g., because
an existing state standard covering this area is already ``at least as effective as'' the new Federal standard. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
These States and territories are Alaska, Arizona, California, Connecticut (plan covers only State and local government
employees), Hawaii, Indiana, Iowa, Kentucky, Maryland, Michigan, Minnesota, Nevada, New Mexico, New York (plan
covers only State and local government employees), North Carolina, Puerto Rico, South Carolina, Oregon, Tennessee,
Utah, Vermont, Virginia, Virgin Islands, Washington and Wyoming. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
After the effective date of the Federal final rule, until such time as a State standard is promulgated, Federal OSHA
will provide interim enforcement assistance, as appropriate, in these States.

understanding and skill required by paragraph (f)(2) of this section, the employer shall retrain each such employee.
Circumstances where retraining is required include, but are not limited to, situations where: 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(i) Changes in the workplace render previous training obsolete; or 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(ii) Changes in the types of PPE to be used render previous training obsolete; or

* As a rule of thumb, start with a shade that is too dark to see the weld zone. Then go to a lighter shade which gives sufficient
view of the weld zone without going below the minimum. In oxyfuel gas welding or cutting where the torch produces a high
yellow light, it is desirable to use a filter lens that absorbs the yellow or sodium line in the visible light of the (spectrum)
operation. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 007 0146 intable -->
** These values apply where the actual arc is clearly seen. Experience has shown that lighter filters may be used when
the arc is hidden by the workpiece.

Selection 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->
This Appendix is intended to provide compliance assistance for employers and employees in implementing requirements
for a hazard assessment and the selection of personal protective equipment. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
1. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=3 -->
Controlling hazards.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->
 PPE devices alone should not be relied on to provide protection against hazards, but should be used in conjunction
with guards, engineering controls, and sound manufacturing practices. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
2. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=3 -->
Assessment and selection.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->
 It is necessary to consider certain general guidelines for assessing the foot, head, eye and face, and hand hazard
situations that exist in an occupational or educational operation or process, and to match the protective devices
to the particular hazard. It should be the responsibility of the safety officer to exercise common sense and appropriate
expertise to accomplish these tasks. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
3. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=3 -->
Assessment guidelines.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->
 In order to assess the need for PPE the following steps should be taken: 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
a. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=3 -->
Survey.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->
 Conduct a walk-through survey of the areas in question. The purpose of the survey is to identify sources of hazards
to workers and co-workers. Consideration should be given to the basic hazard categories: 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(a) Impact 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(b) Penetration 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(c) Compression (roll-over) 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(d) Chemical 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(e) Heat 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(f) Harmful dust 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(g) Light (optical) radiation 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
b. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=3 -->
Sources.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->
 During the walk-through survey the safety officer should observe: (a) sources of motion; i.e., machinery or processes
where any movement of tools, machine elements or particles could exist, or movement of personnel that could result
in collision with stationary objects; (b) sources of high temperatures that could result in burns, eye injury or ignition
of protective equipment, etc.; (c) types of chemical exposures; (d) sources of harmful dust; (e) sources of light
radiation, i.e., welding, brazing, cutting, furnaces, heat treating, high intensity lights, etc.; (f) sources
of falling objects or potential for dropping objects; (g) sources of sharp objects which might pierce the feet or cut
the hands; (h) sources of rolling or pinching objects which could crush the feet; (i) layout of workplace and location
of co-workers; and (j) any electrical hazards. In addition, injury/accident data should be reviewed to help identify
problem areas. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
c. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=3 -->
Organize data.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->
 Following the walk-through survey, it is necessary to organize the data and information for use in the assessment
of hazards. The objective is to prepare for an analysis of the hazards in the environment to enable proper selection
of protective equipment. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
d. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=3 -->
Analyze data.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->
 Having gathered and organized data on a workplace, an estimate of the potential for injuries should be made. Each of
the basic hazards (paragraph 3.a.) should be reviewed and a determination made as to the type, level of risk, and seriousness
of potential injury from each of the hazards found in the area. The possibility of exposure to several hazards simultaneously
should be considered. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
4. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=3 -->
Selection guidelines.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->
 After completion of the procedures in paragraph 3, the general procedure for selection of protective equipment is
to: a) Become familiar with the potential hazards and the type of protective equipment that is available, and what
it can do; i.e., splash protection, impact protection, etc.; b) compare the hazards associated with the environment;
i.e., impact velocities, masses, projectile shape, radiation intensities, with the capabilities of the available
protective equipment; c) select the protective equipment which ensures a level of protection greater than the minimum
required to protect employees from the hazards; and d) fit the user with the protective device and give instructions
on care and use of the PPE. It is very important that end users be made aware of all warning labels for and limitations
of their PPE. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
5. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=3 -->
Fitting the device.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->
 Careful consideration must be given to comfort and fit. PPE that fits poorly will not afford the necessary protection.
Continued wearing of the device is more likely if it fits the wearer comfortably. Protective devices are generally
available in a variety of sizes. Care should be taken to ensure that the right size is selected. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
6. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=3 -->
Devices with adjustable features.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->
 Adjustments should be made on an individual basis for a comfortable fit that will maintain the protective device in
the proper position. Particular care should be taken in fitting devices for eye protection against dust and chemical
splash to ensure that the devices are sealed to the face. In addition, proper fitting of helmets is important to ensure
that it will not fall off during work operations. In some cases a chin strap may be necessary to keep the helmet on an employee's
head. (Chin straps should break at a reasonably low force, however, so as to prevent a strangulation hazard). Where
manufacturer's instructions are available, they should be followed carefully. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
7. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=3 -->
Reassessment of hazards.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->
 It is the responsibility of the safety officer to reassess the workplace hazard situation as necessary, by identifying
and evaluating new equipment and processes, reviewing accident records, and reevaluating the suitability of previously
selected PPE. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->
 Some occupations (not a complete list) for which eye protection should be routinely considered are: carpenters,
electricians, machinists, mechanics and repairers, millwrights, plumbers and pipe fitters, sheet metal workers
and tinsmiths, assemblers, sanders, grinding machine operators, lathe and milling machine operators, sawyers,
welders, laborers, chemical process operators and handlers, and timber cutting and logging workers. The following
chart provides general guidance for the proper selection of eye and face protection to protect against hazards associated
with the listed hazard ``source'' operations.

<!-- PJG /QTAG -->

<!-- PJG 007 0146 intable -->
(1) Care should be taken to recognize the possibility of multiple and simultaneous exposure to a variety of hazards.
Adequate protection against the highest level of each of the hazards should be provided. Protective devices do not
provide unlimited protection. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 007 0146 intable -->
(2) Operations involving heat may also involve light radiation. As required by the standard, protection from both
hazards must be provided. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 007 0146 intable -->
(3) Faceshields should only be worn over primary eye protection (spectacles or goggles). 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 007 0146 intable -->
(4) As required by the standard, filter lenses must meet the requirements for shade designations in 1910.133(a)(5).
Tinted and shaded lenses are 
<!-- PJG ITAG l=12 g=1 f=3 -->
not
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=12 g=1 f=1 -->
 filter lenses unless they are marked or identified as such. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 007 0146 intable -->
(5) As required by the standard, persons whose vision requires the use of prescription (Rx) lenses must wear either
protective devices fitted with prescription (Rx) lenses or protective devices designed to be worn over regular prescription
(Rx) eyewear. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 007 0146 intable -->
(6) Wearers of contact lenses must also wear appropriate eye and face protection devices in a hazardous environment.
It should be recognized that dusty and/or chemical environments may represent an additional hazard to contact lens
wearers. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 007 0146 intable -->
(7) Caution should be exercised in the use of metal frame protective devices in electrical hazard areas. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 007 0146 intable -->
(8) Atmospheric conditions and the restricted ventilation of the protector can cause lenses to fog. Frequent cleansing
may be necessary. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 007 0146 intable -->
(9) Welding helmets or faceshields should be used only over primary eye protection (spectacles or goggles). 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 007 0146 intable -->
(10) Non-sideshield spectacles are available for frontal protection only, but are not acceptable eye protection
for the sources and operations listed for ``impact.'' 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 007 0146 intable -->
(11) Ventilation should be adequate, but well protected from splash entry. Eye and face protection should be designed
and used so that it provides both adequate ventilation and protects the wearer from splash entry. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 007 0146 intable -->
(12) Protection from light radiation is directly related to filter lens density. See note (4) . Select the darkest
shade that allows task performance.

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=3 -->
Selection guidelines for head protection.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->
 All head protection (helmets) is designed to provide protection from impact and penetration hazards caused by falling
objects. Head protection is also available which provides protection 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
from electric shock and burn. When selecting head protection, knowledge of potential electrical hazards is important.
Class A helmets, in addition to impact and penetration resistance, provide electrical protection from low-voltage
conductors (they are proof tested to 2,200 volts). Class B helmets, in addition to impact and penetration resistance,
provide electrical protection from high-voltage conductors (they are proof tested to 20,000 volts). Class C helmets
provide impact and penetration resistance (they are usually made of aluminum which conducts electricity), and should
not be used around electrical hazards. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Where falling object hazards are present, helmets must be worn. Some examples include: working below other workers
who are using tools and materials which could fall; working around or under conveyor belts which are carrying parts
or materials; working below machinery or processes which might cause material or objects to fall; and working on exposed
energized conductors. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Some examples of occupations for which head protection should be routinely considered are: carpenters, electricians,
linemen, mechanics and repairers, plumbers and pipe fitters, assemblers, packers, wrappers, sawyers, welders,
laborers, freight handlers, timber cutting and logging, stock handlers, and warehouse laborers. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=3 -->
Selection guidelines for foot protection.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->
 Safety shoes and boots which meet the ANSI Z41&hyph;1991 Standard provide both impact and compression protection.
Where necessary, safety shoes can be obtained which provide puncture protection. In some work situations, metatarsal
protection should be provided, and in other special situations electrical conductive or insulating safety shoes
would be appropriate. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Safety shoes or boots with impact protection would be required for carrying or handling materials such as packages,
objects, parts or heavy tools, which could be dropped; and, for other activities where objects might fall onto the
feet. Safety shoes or boots with compression protection would be required for work activities involving skid trucks
(manual material handling carts) around bulk rolls (such as paper rolls) and around heavy pipes, all of which could
potentially roll over an employee's feet. Safety shoes or boots with puncture protection would be required where
sharp objects such as nails, wire, tacks, screws, large staples, scrap metal etc., could be stepped on by employees
causing a foot injury. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Some occupations (not a complete list) for which foot protection should be routinely considered are: shipping and
receiving clerks, stock clerks, carpenters, electricians, machinists, mechanics and repairers, plumbers and
pipe fitters, structural metal workers, assemblers, drywall installers and lathers, packers, wrappers, craters,
punch and stamping press operators, sawyers, welders, laborers, freight handlers, gardeners and grounds-keepers,
timber cutting and logging workers, stock handlers and warehouse laborers. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
11. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=3 -->
Selection guidelines for hand protection.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->
 Gloves are often relied upon to prevent cuts, abrasions, burns, and skin contact with chemicals that are capable of
causing local or systemic effects following dermal exposure. OSHA is unaware of any gloves that provide protection
against 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=3 -->
all
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->
 potential hand hazards, and commonly available glove materials provide only limited protection against many chemicals.
Therefore, it is important to select the most appropriate glove for a particular application and to determine how
long it can be worn, and whether it can be reused. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
It is also important to know the performance characteristics of gloves relative to the specific hazard anticipated;
e.g., chemical hazards, cut hazards, flame hazards, etc. These performance characteristics should be assessed
by using standard test procedures. Before purchasing gloves, the employer should request documentation from the
manufacturer that the gloves meet the appropriate test standard(s) for the hazard(s) anticipated. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Other factors to be considered for glove selection in general include: 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(A) As long as the performance characteristics are acceptable, in certain circumstances, it may be more cost effective
to regularly change cheaper gloves than to reuse more expensive types; and, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(B) The work activities of the employee should be studied to determine the degree of dexterity required, the duration,
frequency, and degree of exposure of the hazard, and the physical stresses that will be applied. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
With respect to selection of gloves for protection against chemical hazards: 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(A) The toxic properties of the chemical(s) must be determined; in particular, the ability of the chemical to cause
local effects on the skin and /or to pass through the skin and cause systemic effects; 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(B) Generally, any ``chemical resistant'' glove can be used for dry powders; 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(C) For mixtures and formulated products (unless specific test data are available), a glove should be selected on
the basis of the chemical component with the shortest breakthrough time, since it is possible for solvents to carry
active ingredients through polymeric materials; and, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(D) Employees must be able to remove the gloves in such a manner as to prevent skin contamination. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
12. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=3 -->
Cleaning and maintenance.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->
 It is important that all PPE be kept clean and properly maintained. Cleaning is particularly important for eye and
face protection where dirty or fogged lenses could impair vision. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
For the purposes of compliance with 1910.132 (a) and (b), PPE should be inspected, cleaned, and maintained at regular
intervals so that the PPE provides the requisite protection. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
It is also important to ensure that contaminated PPE which cannot be decontaminated is disposed of in a manner that
protects employees from exposure to hazards.
