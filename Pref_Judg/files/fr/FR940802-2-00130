SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
In recent years, many important initiatives have been undertaken by regulatory authorities and industry associations
to promote international harmonization of regulatory requirements. FDA has participated in many meetings designed
to enhance harmonization and is committed to seeking scientifically based harmonized technical procedures for
pharmaceutical development. One of the goals of harmonization is to identify and then reduce differences in technical
requirements for drug development.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
ICH was organized to provide an opportunity for tripartite harmonization initiatives to be developed with input
from both regulatory and industry representatives. FDA also seeks input from consumer representatives and others.
ICH is concerned with harmonization of technical requirements for the registration of pharmaceutical products
among three regions: The European Union, Japan, and the United States. The six ICH sponsors are the European Commission,
the European Federation of Pharmaceutical Industry Associations, the Japanese Ministry of Health and Welfare,
the Japanese Pharmaceutical Manufacturers Association, FDA, and the U.S. Pharmaceutical Manufacturers Association.
The ICH Secretariat, which coordinates the preparation of documentation, is provided by the International Federation
of Pharmaceutical Manufacturers Associations (IFPMA).
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The ICH Steering Committee includes representatives from each of the ICH sponsors and the IFPMA, as well as observers
from the World Health Organization, the Canadian Health Protection Branch, and the European Free Trade Area.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
At a meeting held on September 16, 1992, the ICH Steering Committee agreed that the draft tripartite guideline entitled
``Studies in Support of Special Populations: Geriatrics'' should be made available for comment. Subsequently,
the draft guideline which published in the 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 -->
Federal Register
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 of April 16, 1993 (58 FR 21082), was made available for comment by the European Commission and the Japanese Ministry
of Health and Welfare, as well as by FDA, in accordance with their consultation procedures. At a meeting held on June
24, 1993, the comments were analyzed and the guideline was revised as necessary. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
With this notice, FDA is publishing in final form a guideline entitled ``Studies in Support of Special Populations:
Geriatrics.'' This guideline has been endorsed by all ICH sponsors. The guideline provides useful information to
sponsors submitting applications to both CDER and CBER. The guideline addresses harmonization in relation to clinical
testing programs for drugs intended for use in medicines for the geriatric population, which is expected to increase
significantly in the near future in Europe, Japan, and the United States. The use of drugs in the geriatric population
requires special consideration due to the frequent occurrence of underlying diseases, concomitant drug therapy,
and the consequent risks of drug interaction. The recommendations of this guideline do not materially differ from
the recommendations of a 1989 CDER guideline entitled ``Guideline for the Study of Drugs Likely to be Used in the Elderly.''
Although the ICH harmonized guideline provides much useful information for sponsors submitting applications to
CDER and CBER, the 1989 document contains background and additional commentary not present in the harmonized guideline.
For this reason, FDA intends to provide both the ICH harmonized guideline and the 1989 document when information is
requested on the study of new drugs in a geriatric population.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Guidelines are generally issued under &sect;10.90(b) (21 CFR 10.90(b)), which provides for the use of guidelines
to state procedures or standards of general applicability that are not legal requirements but that are acceptable
to FDA. The agency is now in the process of revising &sect;10.90(b). Therefore, this guideline is not being issued
under the authority of &sect;10.90(b), and it does not create or confer any rights, privileges, or benefits for or
on any person, nor does it operate to bind FDA in any way. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
As with all of FDA's guidelines, the public is encouraged to submit written comments with new data or other new information
pertinent to this guideline. The comments will be periodically reviewed and, where appropriate, the guideline will
be amended. The public will be notified of any such amendments through a notice in the 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

Federal Register
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Interested persons may, at any time, submit written comments on the guideline to the Dockets Management Branch (address
above). Two copies of any comments are to be submitted, except that individuals may submit one copy. Comments are to
be identified with the docket number found in brackets in the heading of this document. The guideline and received
comments may be seen in the office above between 9 a.m. and 4 p.m., Monday through Friday.

I. Statement of Purpose
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->
It is important to ensure that clinical testing programs are carried out according to harmonised guidelines based
on agreed ethical and scientific principles so that the international development of valuable innovative drugs
is achieved with maximum efficiency. Harmonisation in relation to medicines for geriatric populations is an important
issue because the total population of the elderly will increase significantly in the coming years in Europe, Japan
and the USA. The use of drugs in this population requires special consideration due to the frequent occurrence of underlying
diseases, concomitant drug therapy and the consequent risk of drug interaction.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=73 g=1 f=1 -->
II. General Principle 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->
Drugs should be studied in all age groups, including the elderly, for which they will have significant utility. Patients
entering clinical trials should be reasonably representative of the population that will be later treated by the
drug.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=73 g=1 f=1 -->
III. Scope of Guideline
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->
This guideline is directed principally toward new Molecular Entities that are likely to have significant use in the
elderly, either because the disease intended to be treated is characteristically a disease of aging (e.g., Alzheimer's
disease) or because the population to be treated is known to include substantial numbers of geriatric patients (e.g.,
hypertension). The guideline applies also to new formulations and new combinations of established medicinal products
when there is specific reason to expect that conditions common in the elderly (e.g., renal or hepatic impairment,
impaired cardiac function, concomitant illnesses or concomitant medications) are likely to be encountered and
are not already dealt with in current labelling. It likewise applies when the new formulation or new combination is
likely to alter the geriatric patient's response (with regard to either safety/tolerability or efficacy) compared
with that of the non-geriatric patient in a way different from previous formulations. The guideline also applies
to new uses that have significant potential applicability to the elderly.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
It is recommended that exemptions from the guideline be determined in advance either by sponsors or, where feasible,
by the sponsor and drug registration authorities, based, e.g., on estimates of the disease prevalence by age or through
examination of the age distribution of usage for other drugs of the same class or drugs used for the same indication.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=73 g=1 f=1 -->
IV. Definition of the Population
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->
The geriatric population is arbitrarily defined, for the purpose of this guideline, as comprising patients aged
65 years or older. It is important, however, to seek patients in the older age range, 75 and above, to the extent possible.
Protocols should not ordinarily include arbitrary upper age cutoffs. It is also important not to exclude unnecessarily
patients with concomitant illnesses; it is only by observing such patients that drug-disease interactions can be
detected. The older the population likely to use the drug, the more important it is to include the very old.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=73 g=1 f=1 -->
V. Clinical Experience
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->
Geriatric patients should be included in the Phase 3 database (and in Phase 2, at the sponsor's option) in meaningful
numbers. The geriatric subpopulation should be represented sufficiently to permit the comparison of drug response
in them to that of younger patients. For drugs used in diseases not unique to, but present in, the elderly, a minimum
of 100 patients would usually allow detection of clinically important differences. For drugs to treat relatively
uncommon diseases, smaller numbers of the elderly would be expected. Where the disease to be treated is characteristically
associated with aging (e.g., Alzheimer's disease) it is expected that geriatric patients will constitute the major
portion of the clinical database.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The overall database of the dossier should be examined for the presence of age-related differences, e.g., in adverse
event rates, in effectiveness, and in dose-response. If these relatively crude overview analyses show important
differences, further evaluation may be needed.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The geriatric data used in the overview can come either from the inclusion 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
of elderly patients in all or most of the main Phase 3 or Phase 2/3 studies or from studies conducted exclusively in geriatric
patients, at the sponsor's option. Inclusion of both groups in the same studies has the advantage of allowing direct
comparisons of younger and older patients using data collected in similar ways. Such comparisons are more difficult
when separate studies of young and old patients are used. Certain assessments, however, e.g., studies of cognitive
function, require special planning and can be best accomplished in separate studies. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=73 g=1 f=1 -->
VI. Pharmacokinetic Studies
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->
Most of the recognized important differences between younger and older patients have been pharmacokinetic differences,
often related to impairment of excretory (renal or hepatic) function or to drug-drug interactions. It is important
to determine whether or not the pharmacokinetic behavior of the drug in elderly subjects or patients is different
from that in younger adults and to characterize the effects of influences, such as abnormal renal or hepatic function,
that are more common in the elderly even though they can occur in any age group. Information regarding age-related
differences in the pharmacokinetics of the drug can come, at the sponsor's option, either from a Pharmacokinetic
Screen (as described subsequently) or from formal pharmacokinetic studies, in the elderly and in patients with excretory
functional impairment.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
It is recognized that for certain drugs and applications (e.g., some topically-applied agents, some proteins) technical
limitations such as low systemic drug levels may preclude or limit exploration of age-related pharmacokinetic differences.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=71 g=1 f=1 -->
A. Formal Pharmacokinetic Studies
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->
Formal PK studies can be done either in healthy geriatric subjects or in patient volunteers with the disease to be treated
by the drug.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The initial PK study can be a pilot trial of limited size conducted under steady-state conditions to look for sizable
differences between older and younger subjects or patients. A larger, single-dose PK study of sufficient size to
permit statistical comparisons between geriatric and younger subjects' or patients' pharmacokinetic profiles
is also acceptable.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In either case, if large (i.e., potentially medically important) age-related differences are found, the initial
PK study may need to be followed by a multiple-dose PK study of sufficient size to permit statistical comparisons (geriatric
vs. younger) at steady-state.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=71 g=1 f=1 -->
B. Pharmacokinetic Screening Approach
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->
Sponsors may opt, instead of conducting a separate PK evaluation of the elderly, to utilize a Pharmacokinetic Screen
in conjunction with the main Phase 3 (and Phase 2, if the sponsor wishes) clinical trials program. This screening procedure
involves obtaining, under steady-state conditions, a small number (one or two) of drug blood level determinations
at ``trough'' (i.e., just prior to the next dose) or other defined times from sufficient numbers of Phase 2/3 clinical
trials patients, geriatric and younger, to detect age-associated differences in pharmacokinetic behavior, if
they are present. It is important to record time of dosing prior to blood concentration measurements, and relation
of dosing to meals, and to examine the influence of demographic and disease factors, such as gender renal function,
presence of liver disease, gastrointestinal disease or heart disease, body size and composition, and concomitant
illnesses.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Small differences are unlikely to be of medical importance. Where the screen detects large differences, formal pharmacokinetic
studies may be indicated unless the screen's results are sufficiently informative.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The advantage of a Pharmacokinetic Screen is that it can assess the effects, not only of age itself, but also of other
factors associated with age (altered body composition, other drugs, concomitant illness) and their interactions.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=73 g=1 f=1 -->
VII. Pharmacokinetics in Renally or Hepatically Impaired Patients
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->
Renal impairment is an aging-associated finding that can also occur in younger patients. Therefore, it is a general
principle, not specific to these guidelines, that drugs excreted (parent drug or active metabolites) significantly
through renal mechanisms should be studied to define the effects of altered renal function on their pharmacokinetics.
Such information is needed for drugs that are the subject of this guideline but it can be obtained in younger subjects
with renal impairment.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Similarly, drugs subject to significant hepatic metabolism and/or excretion, or that have active metabolites,
may pose special problems in the elderly. Pharmacokinetic studies should be carried out in hepatically-impaired
young or elderly patient volunteers.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
If a Pharmacokinetic Screen approach is chosen by the sponsor (Section VI, see above), and if patients with documented
renal impairment or hepatic impairment (depending on the drug's elimination pattern) are included and the results
indicate no medically important pharmacokinetic difference, that information may be sufficient to meet this Geriatric
Guideline's purpose.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=73 g=1 f=1 -->
VIII. Pharmacodynamic/Dose Response Studies
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->
The number of age-related pharmacodynamic differences (i.e., increased or decreased therapeutic response, or
side effects, at a given plasma concentration of drug) discovered to date is too small to necessitate dose response
or other pharmacodynamic studies in geriatric patients as a routine requirement. Separate studies are, however,
recommended in the following situations:
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Sedative/hypnotic agents and other psychoactive drugs or drugs with important CNS effects, such as sedating antihistamines
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Where subgroup comparisons (geriatric versus younger) in the Phase 2/3 clinical trials database indicate potentially
medically significant age-associated differences in the drug's effectiveness or adverse reaction profile, not
explainable by PK differences 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=73 g=1 f=1 -->
IX. Drug-Drug Interaction Studies
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->
Such interactions are of particular importance to geriatric patients, who are more likely to be using concomitant
medications than younger patients, but of course are not limited to this age group. Therefore it is a general principle,
not specific to these guidelines, that in cases where the therapeutic range (i.e., range of toxic to therapeutic doses)
of the drug or likely concomitant drugs is narrow, and the likelihood of the concomitant therapy is great, that specific
drug-drug interaction studies be considered. The studies needed must be determined case-by-case, but the following
are ordinarily recommended:
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Digoxin and oral anticoagulant interaction studies, because so many drugs alter serum concentrations of these drugs,
they are widely prescribed in the elderly, and they have narrow therapeutic ranges.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
For drugs that undergo extensive hepatic metabolism, determination of the effects of hepatic-enzyme inducers (e.g.,
phenobarbital) and inhibitors (e.g., cimetidine).
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
For drugs metabolized by cytochrome P&hyph;450 enzymes, it is critical to examine the effects of known inhibitors,
such as quinidine (for cytochrome P&hyph;450 2D6) or ketoconazole and macrolide antibiotics (for drugs metabolized
by cytochrome P&hyph;450 3A4). There is a rapidly growing list of drugs that can interfere with other drugs that metabolize,
and sponsors should remain aware of it.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Interaction studies with other drugs that are likely to be used with the test drug (unless important interactions
have been ruled out by a Pharmacokinetic Screen).
