The Agency published a correction notice on May 3, 1993, which amended several sections of the part 279 used oil management
standards that were originally promulgated on September 10, 1992. In the May 3, 1993, correction notice, EPA incorrectly
amended regulatory &sect;271.16, that addressed the requirements for States to have adequate criminal enforcement
authority for hazardous waste. EPA amended the regulation to include enforcement authority for used oil handlers
that manage used oil incorrectly, but EPA inadvertently deleted from &sect;271.16 enforcement authority for the
improper management of hazardous waste. Therefore, today's rule corrects this section to include enforcement authority
for the improper management of both hazardous waste and used oil.

2. Rebuttable Presumption

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The final used oil regulations published on September 10, 1992, allow persons to rebut the presumption that used oil
containing more than 1,000 ppm total halogens is a hazardous waste by using an analytical method from SW&hyph;846,
Third Edition, to show that the used oil does not contain hazardous waste. In the regulations, the Agency provided
information on the cost of SW&hyph;846, Edition III and how to obtain it. However, the Agency misquoted the cost of
the document. The actual cost was $319.00 rather than $110.00 as quoted throughout the September 10, 1992, regulations.
To avoid having to amend the regulations as a result of future changes in the cost of the document, the Agency is deleting
reference to the cost of SW&hyph;846, Edition III from the used oil regulations.

3. Characteristic Hazardous Waste 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Today's rule revises &sect;279.10(b)(2)(iii) by deleting reference to the listing status (under part 261, subpart
D) of a hazardous waste that is mixed with used oil. This change is necessary to correct a contradiction in the regulations
regarding applicability of the used oil management standards to mixtures of used oil and hazardous waste that is listed
in subpart D solely because it exhibits one or more of the characteristics of hazardous waste identified in subpart
C. In technical corrections to the used oil management standards published on May 3, 1993, (57 FR 26420), EPA amended
&sect;279.10(b)(2) to correct an error in the September 10, 1992, standards regarding how these mixtures are regulated.
At that time, conforming changes should have been, but were not made to &sect;279.10(b)(2)(iii). As amended by today's
rule, &sect;279.10(b)(2)(iii) correctly provides that mixtures of used oil and hazardous waste that solely exhibits
one or more hazardous waste characteristic and mixtures of used oil and hazardous waste that is listed in subpart D
solely because it exhibits one or more subpart C hazardous characteristics are regulated as used oil if the mixture
is of used oil and a waste which is hazardous solely because it exhibits the characteristic of ignitability and the
resultant mixture does not exhibit the characteristic of ignitability.
