Temperature-recording devices are easily jarred and rendered 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
inaccurate. They can be calibrated and corrected against a 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
temperature-indicating device (e.g., a thermometer) quite easily, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
however. Processors should do so at least at the beginning and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
end of each production day in order to determine whether the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
instrument was accurate throughout the day's production. In this 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
situation, the temperature-indicating device serves as reference 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
instrument since it is much more reliable. Consequently, the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
temperature-recording device should never show a higher 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
temperature than the temperature-indicating device. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
 Temperature-indicating devices are generally reliable and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
need only be calibrated upon installation and annually 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
thereafter. Calibration should be against a standardized (i.e., 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
traceable to the National Bureau of Standards) thermometer that 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
is not subject to the rigors of the processing environment (Ref. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
85). Temperature-indicating devices must often be read under 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
less than ideal plant conditions, so they should be installed in 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
a location that facilitates easy reading. As with the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
temperature-recording device, the sensor on the temperature-indicating device should be installed so as to accurately

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
represent the temperature of the heating or cooling medium.

Appendix A, section 8. advises processors about corrective 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
action steps that they should consider to comply with the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
proposed corrective action requirements in &sect;123.7 of subpart A. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Because the evaluation of critical limit failures relating to the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
cooking step and the terminal heat treatment step of cooked, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
ready-to-eat products may well require an understanding of the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
technical aspects of thermal process calculations, Appendix A, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
section 8. recommends additional controls to those required by 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
&sect;123.7 in this regard. Of primary importance is the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
recommendation that any corrective action other than processing 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
to eliminate the hazard or destruction must be assessed by a 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
competent process authority. For this purpose, a process 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
authority may be a representative of the firm or may be an 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
outside source, so long as the process authority has a scientific 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
background that is adequate to make the assessment.

6. Sanitary Zones 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Section 123.10 of subpart A establishes requirements for all 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
processors for sanitation within the processing environment. In 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
addition to these requirements, this guideline recommends in 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Appendix A, section 8. that processors of cooked, ready-to-eat 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
products establish sanitary zones in their facilities. The 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
agency invites comments on the merits of this concept and on 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
whether it should be codified in the regulations. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
 The importance of good sanitation in the processing of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
cooked, ready-to-eat products cannot be overemphasized. While, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
as has been stated earlier, plant sanitation has no real bearing 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
on human food safety for many foods, the safety of cooked, ready-to-eat products can be easily jeopardized by pathogens
that are 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
introduced through poor sanitation practices. Consequently, FDA 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
is recommending that processors establish sanitary zones around 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
areas where products that have already been cooked are being 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
handled or stored. The primary purpose of a sanitary zone is to 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
physically separate insanitary objects from cooked products. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Sanitary zones can also minimize the likelihood of airborne contamination through proper filtration and positive
air pressure 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
in the zone. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
 A sanitary zone is a separation of operations by location, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
partition, air flow, or enclosed systems. In most cases, it 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
requires procedural changes to minimize the risk of contamination 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
but not large-scale structural changes. Canada has successfully 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
incorporated the concept of sanitary zones for seafood processing 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
as part of its HACCP-based inspection program (Ref. 116).

K. Guideline For Scombroid Toxin Forming Species 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
FDA is proposing a guideline in Appendix B for handling of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the species in which scombroid toxin can form. This problem is 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
primarily, but not exclusively, associated with members of the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
family Scombridae. The fish involved contain significant levels 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
of naturally occurring free histidine in their flesh, which 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
certain bacteria can decarboxylate into histamine. Significant 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
histamine levels occur when the fish are exposed after death to 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
times and temperatures that permit the growth of these bacteria. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Histamine can result in a mild to severe allergic response in 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
humans. Scombrotoxin poisoning is one of the three most common 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
seafood-related illnesses (Ref. 5, p. 24). The scombrotoxic 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
species that have been associated with foodborne illness include 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
tuna, bluefish, mahi, mackerel, sardines, herring, kahawai, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
anchovies, and marlin. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
 This HACCP guidance is intended to maximize the use of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
controls to ensure proper handling of scombrotoxic species and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
thus to minimize the possibility of a problem. It also 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
recognizes the often complex pathways of movement and ownership 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
through which such fish may pass. Failure to ensure safe 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
handling at any point in the chain may render the fish injurious 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
to health. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
 There is a basis for concern about the safety of the fish as 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
soon as histamine begins to form. Once the histamine-forming 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
process has begun, it is like a chain reaction. Lowering the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
temperature of, or freezing, the fish will slow or arrest the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
process, but only cooking and prevention of recontamination can 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
stop it (Refs. 9 and 117). 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
 The guideline describes a HACCP system that emphasizes 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
reliance upon accurate recordkeeping to show continuity of proper 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
handling. Accurate knowledge of the time/temperature history of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the fish is very important in determining the likelihood that the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
fish are unsafe or may become unsafe. The guideline also calls 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
for more stringent processor controls to be applied to lots for 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
which records are inadequate. While this guideline is designed 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
to prevent problems, nothing in it should be construed as meaning 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
that the agency will not take regulatory action if it finds 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
decomposed fish. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
 The guideline in Appendix B, section 2. identifies receipt 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
of raw materials, which include imported shipments, as a critical 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
control point for processors of scombroid toxin forming species. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Time/temperature abuse by the fisherman can result in 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
decomposition and the resultant production of histamine.
