The following are nonexclusive examples of categories of damage to or loss of property that may be considered by claims
approval and settlement authorities as having been sustained incident to service. Note that a loss unconnected with
the performance of duty, particularly a loss occurring outside of normal duty hours, would often not be deemed incident
to a civilian employee's service, even though the same loss might be deemed incident to a soldier's service. This is
particularly true if the civilian employee is a local foreign national employee. A claims approval or settlement
authority will ask the Chief, Personnel Claims and Recovery Division, USARCS for an advance opinion prior to adjudicating
a claim that is deemed incident to service but does not fall within one of the following categories:
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(a) Losses in quarters or other authorized places. Damage to or loss of property by fire, flood, hurricane, or other
unusual occurrence, or by theft or vandalism may be considered, while located at_
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(1) Quarters, wherever situated, which are assigned to the claimant or otherwise provided in kind by the Government.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(2) Quarters outside the United States, which are occupied ority but are neither assigned to the claimant nor otherwise
provided in kind by the Government. However, a claim is not cognizable when the claimant is_
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(i) A civilian employee who is a local inhabitant.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(ii) A U.S. citizen hired as a civilian employee while residing abroad or after moving to a foreign country as part of
the household of a person who is not a proper party claimant.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(iii) A family member residing outside the United States while the soldier is stationed in a different country.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(iv) A local inhabitant of a U.S. territory who is in that territory at the time of a loss when he or she is in the ARNG either

other parts in fit condition and to load the mobile home to withstand the stress of normal transportation, at his or
her own expense, prior to shipment.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

(4) Efforts by the claimant to save a human life or Government property.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(5) Evacuation from a foreign country on the recommendation or order of competent authority. This subsection provides
payment for property belonging to soldiers and civilian employees and their command-sponsored dependents, with
entitlement to shipment at Government expense, which is abandoned during an evacuation and not recovered, or damaged
by an incident of political unrest or hostile act prompting or following such evacuation.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(d) Loss of money delivered to a Government agent. Loss of funds neither applied as directed by the owner nor returned

Government checks, or into another kind of currency.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(e) Vehicle losses. Vehicles are defined to include automobiles, motorcycles, mopeds, utility trailers, camping
trailers, trucks with mounted camper bodies, motor homes, boats, boat trailers, bicycles, and aircraft. Mobile
homes and other property used as dwelling places are not considered vehicles. Damage to or loss of vehicles and property
properly stored or contained therein may be considered when_
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(1) Used in the performance of military duty, if such use was authorized or directed for the convenience of the Government
and provided_
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(i) The travel did not include commuting to or from the permanent place of duty and,
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(ii) The loss or damage did not arise as a result of a mechanical or structural failure of the vehicle during such usage.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(2) Shipped to, from, or between an overseas area or areas at Government expense in accordance with paragraph (b) of
this section, provided the loss or damage did not arise as a result of mechanical or structural failure of the vehicle
during such shipment.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(3) Located at quarters or place of lodging as defined in paragraphs (a) (1), (2), and (3) of this section, which for
the purposes of this paragraph includes garages, carports, driveways, assigned parking spaces, and lots specifically
provided and used for the purpose of parking at one's quarters, provided that the loss or damage is caused by fire, flood,
hurricane, or other unusual occurrence, or by theft or vandalism. There is a presumption that vehicle theft or vandalism
occurs off the military installation and is generally not compensable. Claims for theft or vandalism to vehicles
(including property stored inside a vehicle) are only payable when a claimant proves that the theft or vandalism occurred
while the vehicle was located at his or her authorized or assigned quarters (for example, a military police report
indicates broken glass from the window is on the driveway).
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(4) Located other than at quarters on a military installation, provided that the loss or damage is caused by fire, flood,
hurricane, or other unusual occurrence. The term ``military installation'' is used broadly to describe any fixed
land area, wherever situated, controlled, and used by military activities or the DOD. A vehicle that is properly on
the installation should be presumed to be incident to the claimant's service unless the application of such a presumption
would be unreasonable under the particular circumstances, such as visiting a fellow soldier on another military
installation while on leave.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(f) Clothing and articles being worn. Damage to or loss of clothing and articles being worn while on a military installation
or in the performance of military duty may be considered, provided such loss was caused by fire, flood, hurricane,
or other unusual occurrence, or by theft. Spilling battery acid, paint or similar substances on clothing, or breaking
eyeglasses during physical training is not an unusual occurrence.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(g) Personal property held as evidence. Deprivation of property held as evidence may be considered when after taking
all circumstances into consideration, the temporary loss of the property will work a grave hardship on the claimant
who is a victim of a crime.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(h) On-post robberies. Claims for losses due to theft from the person on a military installation by the use of force,
violence, or threat to do bodily harm may be considered. If cognizable under Article 139, the claims should be considered
under subpart I.
