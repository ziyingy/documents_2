Appendix P-III-B&hyph;1. Effective dissemination of microorganisms beyond the confines of the greenhouse can
be prevented by one or more of the following procedures: (i) Confine all operations to injections of microorganisms
or other biological procedures (including genetic manipulation) that limit replication or reproduction of viruses
and microorganisms or sequences derived from microorganisms, and confine these injections to internal plant parts
or adherent plant surfaces; (ii) ensure that organisms, which can serve as hosts or promote the transmission of the
virus or microorganism, are not present within the farthest distance that the airborne virus or microorganism may
be expected to be effectively disseminated; (iii) conduct experiments at a time of year when plants that can serve
as hosts are either not growing or are not susceptible to productive infection; (iv) use viruses and other microorganisms
or their genomes that have known arthropod or animal vectors, in the absence of such vectors; (v) use microorganisms
that have an obligate association with the plant; or (vi) use microorganisms that are genetically disabled to minimize
survival outside of the research facility and whose natural mode of transmission requires injury of the target organism,
or assures that inadvertent release is unlikely to initiate productive infection of organisms outside of the experimental
facility.

Appendix P-III-C&hyph;1. Effective dissemination of arthropods and other small animals can be prevented by using
one or more of the following procedures: (i) Use non-flying, flight-impaired, or sterile arthropods; (ii) use non-motile
or sterile strains of small animals; (iii) conduct experiments at a time of year that precludes the survival of escaping
organisms; (iv) use animals that have an obligate association with a plant that is not present within the dispersal
range of the organism; or (v) prevent the escape of organisms present in run-off water by chemical treatment or evaporation
of run-off water.

I. Addition of Appendix Q, Physical and Biological Containment for Recombinant DNA Research Involving Animals,
to the NIH Guidelines
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The following new appendix, Appendix Q, reads as follows:
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Appendix Q specifies containment and confinement practices for research involving whole animals, both those in
which the animal's genome has been altered by stable introduction of recombinant DNA, or DNA derived therefrom, into
the germ-line (transgenic animals) and experiments involving viable recombinant DNA-modified microorganisms
tested on whole animals. The appendix applies to animal research activities with the following modifications:
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Appendix Q shall supersede Appendix G when research animals are of a size or have growth requirements that preclude
the use of containment for laboratory animals. Some animals may require other types of containment (see Appendix
Q-III-D). The animals covered in Appendix Q are those species normally categorized as animals including but not limited
to cattle, swine, sheep, goats, horses, and poultry.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Institutional Biosafety Committee shall include at least one scientist with expertise in animal containment
principles when experiments utilizing Appendix Q require Institutional Biosafety Committee prior approval.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The institution shall establish and maintain a health surveillance program for personnel engaged in animal research
involving viable recombinant DNA-containing microorganisms that require Biosafety Level (BL) 3 or greater containment
in the laboratory.
