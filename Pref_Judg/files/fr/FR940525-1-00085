(ii) Other risk factors for coronary heart disease include a family history of heart disease, high blood pressure,
diabetes, cigarette smoking, obesity, and lack of regular physical exercise. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(iii) Intakes of saturated fat exceed recommended levels in many people in the United States. Intakes of cholesterol
are, on average, at or above recommended levels. Intakes of fiber-containing fruits, vegetables, and grain products
are about half of recommended intake levels. One of the major public health recommendations relative to coronary
heart disease risk is to consume less than 10 percent of calories from saturated fat, and an average of 30 percent or
less of total calories from all fat. Recommended daily cholesterol intakes are 300 mg or less. Recommended total dietary
fiber intakes are about 25 g daily, of which about 25 percent (about 6 g) should be soluble fiber. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(iv) Current dietary guidance recommendations encourage decreased consumption of dietary fat, especially saturated
fat and cholesterol, and increased consumption of fiber-rich foods to help lower blood LDL-cholesterol levels.
Results of numerous studies have shown that fiber-containing fruits, vegetables, and grain products can help lower
blood LDL-cholesterol.

Nature of the claim
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
. A health claim associating diets low in saturated fat and cholesterol and high in fruits, vegetables, and grain products
that contain fiber, particularly soluble fiber, with reduced risk of heart disease may be made on the label or labeling
of a poultry product described in paragraph (f)(3)(ii)(B) of this section;

fiber,'' ``some dietary fibers,'' or ``some fibers,'' and the term ``soluble fiber'' may be used in addition to these
terms;

and cholesterol and high in fruits, vegetables, and grain products that contain fiber.

Optional information
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
. (i) The claim may identify one or more of the following risk factors for heart disease about which there is general
scientific agreement: A family history of coronary heart disease, elevated blood total- and LDL-cholesterol, excess
body weight, high blood pressure, cigarette smoking, diabetes, and physical inactivity. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(ii) The claim may indicate that the relationship of diets low in saturated fat and cholesterol and high in fruits,
vegetables, and grain products that contain fiber to heart disease is through the intermediate link of ``blood cholesterol''
or ``blood total- and LDL-cholesterol.'' 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(iii) The claim may include information from paragraphs (f)(1) and (2) of this section, which summarizes the relationship
between diets low in saturated fat and cholesterol and high in fruits, vegetables, and grain products that contain
fiber and coronary heart disease and the significance of the relationship. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(iv) In specifying the nutrients, the claim may include the term ``total fat'' in addition to the terms ``saturated
fat'' and ``cholesterol.'' 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(v) The claim may indicate that it is consistent with ``Nutrition and Your Health: Dietary Guidelines for Americans.''

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(vi) The claim may include information on the number of people in the United States who have coronary heart disease.
The source of this information shall be identified, and it shall be current information from the U.S. Department of
Health and Human Services. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(vii) The claim may state that individuals with elevated blood total- and LDL-cholesterol should consult their physicians
for medical advice and treatment. If the claim defines high or normal blood total- and LDL-cholesterol levels, then
it shall state that individuals with high blood cholesterol should consult their physicians for medical advice and
treatment.

Model health claims
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
. The following model health claims may be used in food labeling to describe the relationship between diets low in saturated
fat and cholesterol and high in fruits, vegetables, and grain products that contain fiber and risk of heart disease:

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(i) Diets low in saturated fat and cholesterol and rich in fruits, vegetables, and grain products that contain some
types of dietary fiber, particularly soluble fiber, may reduce the risk of heart disease, a disease associated with
many factors. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(ii) Development of heart disease depends on many factors. Eating a diet low in saturated fat and cholesterol and high
in fruits, vegetables, and grain products that contain fiber may lower blood cholesterol levels and reduce your risk
of heart disease.
