Types of grants
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
. Two types of grants are available under the Indian CDBG Program. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(1) 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Single purpose grants 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
provide funds for one or more single purpose projects consisting of an activity or set of activities designed to meet
a specific community development need. This type of grant is awarded through competition with other single purpose
projects. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Imminent threat grants
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 alleviate an imminent threat to public health or safety that requires immediate resolution. This type of grant is
awarded only after a field office determines that such conditions exist and if funds are available for such grants.

of recommending different ceilings for different size tribes/villages (e.g. tribes 5,000+ will have one ceiling
and tribes with less than 5,000 will have a smaller ceiling.) Single purpose grant ceilings for each field office shall
be established in the NOFA.

Individual grant amounts
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
. In determining appropriate grant amounts to be awarded, the field office may take into account the size of the applicant,
the level of demand, the scale of the activity proposed relative to need and operational capacity, the number of persons
to be served, the amount of funds required to achieve project objectives and the administrative capacity of the applicant
to complete the activities in a timely manner.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
(a) Except as provided in paragraph (b) of this section, funds will be allocated to the field offices responsible for
the program on the following basis: 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(1) Each field office will be allocated $1,000,000 as a base amount, to which will be added a formula share of the balance
of the Indian CDBG Program funds, as provided in paragraph (a)(2) of this section. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(2) The amount remaining after the base amount is allocated will be allocated to each field office based on the most
recent data available from reliable sources referable to the same point or period in time, as follows: 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(i) Forty percent (40%) of the funds will be allocated based upon each field office's share of the total eligible Indian
population; 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(ii) Forty percent (40%) of the funds will be allocated based upon each field office's share of the total extent of poverty
among the eligible Indian population; and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(iii) Twenty percent (20%) of the funds will be allocated based upon each field office's share of the total extent of
overcrowded housing among the eligible Indian population. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(b) If funds are set aside by statute for a specific purpose in any fiscal year, the formula in paragraph (a) of this section
will apply unless otherwise specified in the law, or unless it is determined that the formula is inappropriate to accomplish
the purpose, in which case the Secretary may establish other criteria to determine an allocation formula for distributing
funds to the field offices. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(c) Data used for the allocation of funds will be based upon the Indian population of those Tribes and villages that
are determined to be eligible ninety (90) days before the beginning of each fiscal year.

(a) After the rating and ranking process is completed, use of funds that the field office obtains from recapture of
obligated funds from grantees that fail to meet statutory or regulatory requirements, or return of unneeded funds,
will be determined by the Assistant Secretary on a case-by-case basis. The funds may be used to fund the highest ranking
unfunded project, an imminent threat, or other uses as determined by the Assistant Secretary. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(b) Undistributed funds (funds that are unobligated at the conclusion of the rating and ranking process) will be treated
the same as recaptured funds. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(c) Recaptured and undistributed funds will remain with the field office that they came from unless the Assistant
Secretary determines there is an overriding reason to redistribute the funds outside of the field office's jurisdiction.
