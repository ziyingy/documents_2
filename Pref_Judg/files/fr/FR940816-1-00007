Section 631 of the Act provides Customs with direct statutory authority for full electronic processing of all Customs-related
transactions. For each planned NCAP program component, Customs is required to prepare a separate implementation
plan in consultation with the trade community, establish eligibility criteria for voluntary participation in the
program, test the component, and transmit to Congress the implementation plan, testing results, and an evaluation
report. The testing of any planned NCAP components would be conducted under carefully delineated circumstances_with
objective measures of success or failure, a predetermined time frame, and a defined class of participants. Notice
of any NCAP program component testing would be published in both the Customs Bulletin and the 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 and participants solicited. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In addition to testing planned NCAP components there are other areas of Customs-related transactions wherein Customs
and the trade community could benefit from the valuable information that limited test programs/procedures could
provide. Thus, Customs is proposing this regulation in order both to meet its obligations under the NCAP legislation
and to provide itself with the ability to obtain information necessary to predict the effects of various policy options.
If adopted, the regulation would allow the Commissioner of Customs to conduct limited test programs and procedures
and allow certain eligible members of the public to participate on a voluntary basis. Also, because test programs
could require exemptions from regulations in various parts of the Customs Regulations, 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
e.g.,
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 parts 113 (Customs bonds), 141 (entry of merchandise), 142 (entry process), 171 (fines, penalties, and forfeitures),
174 (protests), and 191 (drawback), participants would be subject to requirements different from those specified
in the Customs Regulations, but only to the extent that such different requirements do not affect the collection of
the revenue, public health, safety, or law enforcement. Accordingly, pursuant to the Secretary's authority under
section 624 of the Tariff Act of 1930 (19 U.S.C. 1624) to make such rules and regulations as may be necessary to carry
out the provisions of the Tariff Act of 1930 and pursuant to the requirement set forth in section 413 of the Tariff Act
of 1930 (19 U.S.C. 1413) that the Secretary test planned NCAP program components, it is proposed to amend the Customs
Regulations at part 101 (19 CFR part 101) to allow the Commissioner of Customs to conduct limited test programs and
procedures in general, as well as for purposes of implementing the NCAP provisions of the Act.

Discussion of Proposed Amendment 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Customs proposes to amend part 101 of the Customs Regulations (19 CFR part 101) by adding a new &sect;101.9, which would
allow the Commissioner of Customs to conduct limited test programs and procedures in general and for purposes of implementing
NCAP program components, which may impose upon eligible participants requirements different from those specified
in the Customs Regulations, but only to the extent that such different requirements do not affect the collection of
the revenue, public health, safety, or law enforcement. Those test programs/procedures related to the NCAP would
be subject to certain time, scope, participation, and publication constraints, whereas, those test programs that
are not related to the NCAP would be subject, in general, to constraints concerning time and scope only. However, because
general test programs may affect the processing not only of passengers and carriers but also the importation of merchandise,
Customs recognizes that the provisions of 19 U.S.C. 1484(a)(2)(C), as amended, require that, to the maximum extent
practicable, the Secretary provide for the equal treatment of all importers of record of imported merchandise. Accordingly,
the proposed regulation requires that notice be published in both the Customs Bulletin and the 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 -->
Federal Register
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 before implementing those limited tests or procedures that involve merchandise. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In order to implement test programs and procedures in general (
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
i.e.,
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 tests that are designed to evaluate the effectiveness of new technology or operational procedures in the processing
of passengers, carriers, or merchandise) paragraph (a) authorizes the Commissioner of Customs to provide for requirements
different from those specified in the Customs Regulations, but only to the extent that such different requirements
do not affect the collection of the revenue, public health, safety, or law enforcement. Such different requirements
will be limited in scope, time, and application as necessary to facilitate the conduct of the specified program or
procedure. Where the test program or procedure could affect the processing of merchandise, however, not less than
thirty days prior to implementing such test program or procedure a notice of the test program would be published in
both the Customs Bulletin and the 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 -->
Federal Register
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
, inviting public comments concerning the methodology of the test program or procedure, and which informs interested
members of the public of the eligibility criteria for voluntary participation in the test program and the basis for
selecting participants. Where the test program or procedure does not affect the importation of merchandise and is
not required under the NCAP legislation, however, public notice would not be required. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In order to implement test programs and procedures for purposes of implementing NCAP program components, as described
in section 411(a)(2) of the Tariff Act of 1930 (19 U.S.C. 1411(a)(2)), paragraph (b) similarly authorizes the Commissioner
of Customs to provide for requirements that may be different from those specified in the Customs Regulations, but
only to the extent that such different requirements do not affect the collection of the revenue, public health, safety,
or law enforcement. The publication requirement on tests of planned NCAP components is similar. Not less than 30 days
prior to implementing any test program or procedure notice of the NCAP test would be published in both the Customs Bulletin
and the 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 -->
Federal Register
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 that invites public comments concerning the test program, and informs interested members of the public of the eligibility
criteria for voluntary participation in the test program and the basis for selecting participants. Within a reasonable
time following the completion of the test program or procedure a description of the results would be published in both
the Customs Bulletin and the
