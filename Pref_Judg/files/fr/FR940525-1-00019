1. Purchased Loan Servicing Rights That Embody a Direct Credit Substitute 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Banking organizations and thrifts that sell receivables often retain the servicing rights on the transferred assets.
Banking organizations and thrifts may also acquire loan servicing rights as separate assets such as purchased mortgage
servicing rights. The terms of some loan servicing agreements require the servicer to absorb credit losses on the
loans, so that the servicer effectively extends a credit enhancement (in the form of recourse or a direct credit substitute)
to the owners of the loans. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Currently, all of the Agencies treat as recourse retained loan servicing rights that embody an obligation to provide
credit or other loss protection to the owners of the loans. Accordingly, risk-based capital is required against the
full amount of the assets serviced. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Under the Banking Agencies' proposal, banking organizations with purchased loan servicing rights that extend credit
protection (a direct credit substitute) to the owners of the loans being serviced would also be required to hold capital
against the total outstanding amount of those loans.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=1 -->
22
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 Thus, banking organizations that purchase such servicing rights would be required to apply the 100% credit conversion
factor to the amount of assets enhanced (the amount of the loans serviced) to convert this off-balance sheet exposure
into an on-balance sheet credit equivalent amount.

The risk-based capital requirement for the servicer's exposure to credit risk from the loans would be in addition
to the separate risk-based capital requirement that is currently required to support qualifying intangible assets
under the risk-based capital standards. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The proposed low-level recourse rule would apply if the servicer's maximum retained recourse obligation is contractually
limited to an amount that is less than the amount of capital that would be required against the total amount of the loans
serviced.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
(Question 3) 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The Agencies request comment on whether purchased loan servicing rights agreements exist that obligate the servicer
to provide credit loss protection for only the second dollars of losses from the loans. In determining a servicer's
loss position, the Agencies do not consider access to loan collateral upon default to place the servicer in a second
loss position. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Adoption of the proposal would align the Banking Agencies' treatment of purchased loan servicing rights that embody
a direct credit substitute with that of the OTS, which already explicitly requires capital support for these arrangements.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=1 -->
24
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 Currently, the FDIC and OCC do not explicitly require capital support for these arrangements.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 (Capital is required for the allowed portion of the intangible asset generated by the purchase of mortgage servicing
rights, but not for the servicer's separate risk of loss on the underlying loans). The FRB considers purchased mortgage
servicing rights that provide credit protection to be a direct credit substitute and requires capital support for
the risk associated with the underlying mortgage loans. Thus, the proposal would make this treatment explicit in
the FRB's guidelines.

2. Purchased Subordinated Interests 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The proposal would extend the current risk-based capital treatment of retained subordinated interests to purchased
subordinated interests that absorb the first dollars of losses from the underlying loans or loan pools. Currently,
banking organizations with purchased subordinated interests are required to hold risk-based capital only against
the carrying value of the subordinated interest. In contrast, the OTS currently treats purchased subordinated interests
in the same manner as retained subordinated interests, 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
i.e.,
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 as recourse, except for certain high quality subordinated interests.

The OTS will continue to recognize the 20 percent risk-weight for high quality residential mortgage-backed senior
and subordinated interests that qualify under the Secondary Mortgage Market Enhancement Act of 1984 (SMMEA), Section
3(a)(41) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, 15 U.S.C. 78c(a)(41), except as discussed in Regulatory Bulletin
26. These types of securities are commonly referred to as ``SMMEA securities.''

</FOOTNOTE>

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Under this proposal, banking organizations with direct credit substitutes in the form of purchased subordinated
interests that absorb the first dollars of losses from the underlying assets would be required to hold risk-based
capital against the carrying value of the subordinated interest plus the outstanding amount of all more senior interests
that the subordinated interest supports.

 If the carrying value of the most subordinated portion of the loan, or pool of loans, is less than the full, effective
risk-based capital requirement for the total underlying loan, or pool of loans, then the low-level treatment would
apply, 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
i.e.,
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 the subordinated portion would be assessed risk-based capital dollar-for-dollar against its carrying value. For
example, if the most subordinated portion of a pool of mortgage assets that qualifies for the 50% risk-weight is held
by a banking organization and its carrying value represents only 3% of the total pool, the capital requirement for
the subordinated portion would be 3% of the total pool rather than 4% (
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
i.e.,
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 the carrying value of the subordinated portion rather than the full effective capital requirement for the pool).

If the subordinated portion of the loan, or pool of loans, is held by several banking organizations or thrifts, each
institution would be required to hold risk-based capital against the carrying value of its subordinated interest
plus its proportionate share of all more senior interests that the subordinated interest supports.

The Banking Agencies' risk-based capital treatment of purchased subordinated interests that represent middle

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
i.e.,
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 purchased subordinated interests that absorb losses only after prior enhancements that absorb the first dollars
of losses have been fully exhausted) would not be affected by this proposal.

3. Financial Standby Letters of Credit and Guarantee-Like Arrangements 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The proposal would extend the risk-based capital treatment that is currently applied to asset transfers with recourse
to financial standby letters of credit and guarantee-like arrangements that absorb the first dollars of losses from
third-party assets. The risk-based capital assessment for this form of credit enhancement would be based on the full
amount of the assets enhanced rather than the face amount of the standby letter of credit or guarantee-like arrangement.
