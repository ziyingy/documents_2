, either directly or through a subsidiary, in a nonbanking activity that is listed in  225.25 of Regulation Y as closely
related to banking and permissible for bank holding companies. Unless otherwise noted, such activities will be conducted
throughout the United States.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The application is available for immediate inspection at the Federal Reserve Bank indicated. Once the application
has been accepted for processing, it will also be available for inspection at the offices of the Board of Governors.
Interested persons may express their views in writing on the question whether consummation of the proposal can ``reasonably
be expected to produce benefits to the public, such as greater convenience, increased competition, or gains in efficiency,
that outweigh possible adverse effects, such as undue concentration of resources, decreased or unfair competition,
conflicts of interests, or unsound banking practices.'' Any request for a hearing on this question must be accompanied
by a statement of the reasons a written presentation would not suffice in lieu of a hearing, identifying specifically
any questions of fact that are in dispute, summarizing the evidence that would be presented at a hearing, and indicating
how the party commenting would be aggrieved by approval of the proposal.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Comments regarding the application must be received at the Reserve Bank indicated or the offices of the Board of Governors
not later than June 30, 1994.
