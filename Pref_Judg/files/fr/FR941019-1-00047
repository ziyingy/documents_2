The tolerance rule accommodates operational problems associated with the blending of gasohol. For example, blenders
may fail to attain the required 10-percent alcohol level because the device used to meter the amount of gasoline or
alcohol added to a tank truck is imprecise or because the high-speed gasoline or alcohol pump used does not shut off
at the proper moment. Blenders cannot compensate for these errors by aiming for an alcohol content in excess of 10 percent
because Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) rules do not authorize the sale of gasohol containing more than 10
percent alcohol.

Effective January 1, 1993, section 1920 of the Energy Act amended section 4081(c) to allow a reduction from the regular
rate for mixtures containing at least 5.7 percent alcohol but less than 7.7 percent alcohol (5.7 percent gasohol)
and mixtures containing at least 7.7 percent alcohol but less than 10 percent alcohol (7.7 percent gasohol). The 5.4-
and 6-cents-per-gallon rate reductions were retained for mixtures containing at least 10 percent alcohol (10 percent
gasohol) and were prorated for 5.7 percent and 7.7 percent gasohol to maintain the subsidy level of 54 cents or 60 cents
per gallon, respectively, for ethanol or other alcohol that is mixed with gasoline.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The proposed regulations continue the present tolerance rule for mixtures that contain less than 10 percent alcohol
but at least 9.8 percent alcohol. However, a similar rule is not extended to mixtures that contain less than 7.7 or 5.7
percent alcohol because blenders can compensate for any operational problems by aiming for an alcohol content above
7.7 or 5.7 percent without violating EPA rules.

Gasohol; Blender Credit or Payment

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
If a gasohol blender produces gasohol from gasoline that was taxed at the regular rate, section 6427(f) allows the
gasohol blender to obtain a partial credit or payment relating to that tax. The proposed regulations provide the conditions
under which a credit or payment under section 6427(f) will be allowed.

The regulations under section 40 provide that alcohol used to produce ethyl tertiary butyl ether (ETBE) generally
is treated as

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
alcohol
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 for purposes of the alcohol fuels credit when the ETBE is mixed with gasoline. The proposed regulations provide a similar
rule with respect to alcohol used to produce ETBE for purposes of the reduced tax rates for gasohol. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
For example, a gasoline/ETBE mixture would qualify as 5.7 percent gasohol if the mixture contains 12.7 percent ETBE
and each gallon of ETBE is made from .45 gallon of alcohol.

These regulations are being issued in proposed form to provide timely guidance to taxpayers and to allow interested
parties appropriate opportunity to provide comments before issuance of final regulations. Although final regulations
may include changes made, for example, in response to comments, taxpayers may rely on the proposed regulations until
final regulations are issued. For example, alcohol used to produce ETBE is treated as

It has been determined that this notice of proposed rulemaking is not a significant regulatory action as defined in
EO 12866. Therefore, a regulatory assessment is not required. It also has been determined that section 553(b) of the
Administrative Procedure Act (5 U.S.C. chapter 5) and the Regulatory Flexibility Act (5 U.S.C. chapter 6) do not apply
to these regulations, and, therefore, a Regulatory Flexibility Analysis is not required. Pursuant to section 7805(f)
of the Internal Revenue Code, this notice of proposed rulemaking will be submitted to the Chief Counsel for Advocacy
of the Small Business Administration for comment on its impact on small business.
