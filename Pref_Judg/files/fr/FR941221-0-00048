NASA published an interim rule (58 FR 54050) on October 20, 1993, amending the NASA FAR Supplement to provide for revised
cross-waivers of liability clauses for Space Shuttle services and Space Station activities and to provide for a new
cross-waiver of liability for Expendable Launch Vehicle (ELV) launches. The existing cross-waiver clause for Space
Shuttle was revised and the ELV program launch cross-waiver clause was developed to be consistent with the cross-waiver
clause that had been in effect for space station activities, because it was becoming increasingly complex for users,
customers, contractors, and NASA to work under somewhat inconsistent cross-waivers of liability in agreements
for Space Station activities, ELV launches, and Shuttle launch services not related to Space Station.

Based upon a review of public comments on the interim rule, only minor changes needed to be made to NASA FAR Supplement
clause 1852.228&hyph;76, ``Cross-waiver of Liability for Space Station Activities,'' since it already contained
language corresponding with the provision in the original final rule regarding cross-waiver agreements. No changes
needed to be made to NASA FAR Supplement clauses 1852.228&hyph;72, ``Cross-Waiver of Liability for Space Shuttle
Services,'' and 1852.228&hyph;78 ``Cross-Waiver of Liability for NASA Expendable Launch Vehicle Launches,''
but both these clauses are reprinted in this final rule in their entirety.

For these reasons, NASA has adopted, for use in contracts for Space Shuttle services and ELV launches, the new cross-waiver
clauses set forth in this rule. Like the Space Station cross-waiver, the new Shuttle and ELV cross-waivers will apply
to all activities done in implementation of Shuttle and ELV contracts. However, when an activity that involves Shuttle
launch services or a NASA ELV launch is to be conducted under the Space Station program, the Space Station cross-waiver,
not the respective Shuttle or ELV cross-waiver, will be utilized in the agreement governing that activity.

NASA received thirteen comments in response to the Interim Rule. Several comments suggest that there may be some misunderstanding
about the nature and the purpose of the cross-waiver clauses. The cross-waiver clause is not the waiver between the
Government and the contractor but rather the fulfillment of NASA's obligation to flow down the cross-waiver in order
to bar claims by NASA contractors against parties or users with whom NASA has entered into agreements for services.
The language in 1828.371(a) clarifies this intent. The language in paragraph (a) of the clauses also states the purpose
and objective of the cross-waiver clauses. Several other comments suggest there may be some misunderstanding between
the nature of the cross-waivers and of indemnification under Public Law 85&hyph;804. When the Government provides
indemnification coverage to its contractor, the Government will hold a contractor harmless from third party liability,
as well as from damage or harm to Government and contractor employees and property, as a result of exposure to unusually
hazardous risks. Indemnification represents a relationship between the Government and its contractor. A cross-waiver
does not provide indemnification protection as it does not waive third party liability between the Government and
its contractors. When the Government flows down a cross-waiver of liability to its contractors, there is a waiver
of liability between the Parties involved in Protected Space Operations, not between the Government and its contractors
(recognizing that the cross-waiver shall apply only if the person, entity, or property causing the damage is damaged
as a result of its involvement in Protected Space Operations). A cross-waiver represents a relationship between
Parties involved in Protected Space Operations as well as between the Parties' related entities involved in Protected
Space Operations. Therefore, claims between the Government and its contractor are not covered by the cross-waiver.
The cross-waiver clauses remain unchanged, since no modification is necessary to address coverage for indemnification-related
issues. Since indemnification is a separate issue from cross-waiver liability, no change is made to the cross-waiver
clauses stating that they must be inserted in a contract that contains indemnification coverage under Public Law
85&hyph;804. As stated in 1828.371, the appropriate cross-waiver clause is inserted in solicitations or contracts
of $100,000 or more when the work to be performed involves Protected Space Operations.

The remaining comments will be addressed individually as follows. One comment noted that the definition of ``Partner
State'' in clause 1852.228&hyph;76 includes signatories to the current Intergovernmental Agreement. This definition
fails to include Russia's or any other unforeseen future partner's involvement. For this reason, the definition
of ``Partner State'' in 48 CFR 1852.228&hyph;76(b)(3) has been changed to include any future signatories to the Intergovernmental
Agreement. A second comment states that the definition of ``Protected Space Operations'' in each clause differs
from the current 1852.228&hyph;72 clause which defines the end of the activity period in detail. The comment recommends
that the new clauses better define the end of Protected Space Operations. This Final Rule leaves the definition of
``Protected Space Operations'' unchanged. The definition as well as the scope of cross-waivers have been broadened
intentionally as set forth in the final rule for agreements in September 1991. There is no latitude to change this definition
in the flow down from agreements to contract clauses. The third comment recommended that the words ``or gross negligence''
be added after the words ``willful misconduct'' in (c)(4)(iii) of each clause. The rationale mentioned that omission
of the phrase ``gross negligence'' would raise a potential conflict between the clause and the laws of most states
which refuse to recognize advance agreements to waive liability based on gross negligence as being contrary to public
policy. The clauses remain unchanged, because it is U.S. Federal policy to waive all degrees of negligence when the
Federal Government is involved in space launch activities. A fourth comment stated the cross-waiver does not address
the situation in which one of the parties fails to obtain the waiver agreement. The clauses remain unchanged. There
is no requirement to state that the contractor's failure to flow down clauses does not obviate application of the substantive
aspects of the clause to that contractor. Another comment requested that paragraph (b)(3), the definition of ``Party,''
clarify that the U.S. Government agency signing the agreement is signing on behalf of the United States and all its
related entities. While the clauses remain unchanged, clarification of this point may be necessary. The U.S. Government
agency signing the agreement is definitely signing on behalf of the United States and all its related entities.
