In addition, these proposed regulations would not apply to vessels which transport some quantity of municipal or
commercial waste incidental to the predominant business or purpose of the vessel. For example, a ferry transporting
people and vehicles which also transports a garbage truck loaded with municipal or commercial waste is not required
to apply for a SPA permit and would be exempt from complying with this rule. In this example, the ferry's predominant
business or purpose is not waste transportation.

The conference report on P.L. 100&hyph;688 states that SPA was intended ``only to apply to vessels whose purpose is
the transportation of municipal or commercial waste, not all vessels. It was not intended to apply to vessels that
may generate waste during their `normal operations'.'' Examples of vessels exempt from this rule because of the normal
operation exemption would be a cruise ship and a fishing vessel, both of which transport waste generated by the crew
and passengers during a voyage. This ``normal operation'' exemption is set forth in section 4101(3)(B) of SPA. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
If normal operational waste meeting the definition of municipal or commercial waste is transferred from the generating
vessel to another vessel contracted to transport waste, the vessel receiving the municipal or commercial waste is
subject to the requirements of SPA as a vessel and receiving facility and must comply with requirements under these
regulations when finalized. The waste generating vessel is not regulated under SPA. This clarification allows vessels,
such as cruise ships and fishing vessels, to offload their normal operational waste without being subject to SPA requirements.

SPA section 4103(a)(1) requires owners or operators of waste sources to take all reasonable steps to assure that all
municipal or commercial waste is loaded onto a vessel in a manner that assures that waste deposited into coastal waters
is minimized. There are a variety of entities that handle municipal or commercial waste that are considered waste
sources for purposes of these regulations. These include trucks, certain vessels, waste transfer stations, and
island docks or piers. The following provides some examples of how and when this regulation applies to some of these
waste sources. Offshore oil and gas exploration platforms will not be considered waste sources under SPA, for the
reasons set forth below.

A truck transporting municipal or commercial waste will be considered a waste source (i.e., rolling stock or motor
vehicle) if it directly loads its waste onto a vessel. If a truck will be transferring municipal or commercial waste
to a vessel by means of a waste transfer station, EPA is proposing in &sect;237.2(b)(4) that the truck not be considered
a waste source, and therefore not be subject to the requirements of these regulations on its own. Instead, the waste
transfer station would be considered the waste source responsible for ensuring that the waste transfer meets the
waste handling standards for these regulations. Section 237.4(e)(1)(ii) should be interpreted to require the owner
or operator of a waste source to incorporate guidelines in the Operation and Maintenance manual that accounts for
the truck or vessel transfer. The waste transfer station more typically will have the necessary equipment and personnel
to comply with these regulations. Rolling stock and motor vehicles typically are not equipped with containment or
diversionary structures e.g. dip nets, oily water separators etc., and will not, in most cases, be able to comply with
requirements being proposed in &sect;237.4.

In the situation where waste is transferred from an offshore oil and gas development and production facility, the
oil and gas facility is not a waste source for purposes of these regulations. That transfer is governed by the Clean
Water Act (National Pollution Discharge Elimination System), which regulates, among other things, the discharge
of pollutants from point sources, including offshore oil and gas development and production facilities, and the
Marine Plastic Pollution Research and Control Act (MPPRCA) which governs the regulation of garbage generated by
ships. Under the Clean Water Act, EPA has promulgated effluent limitation guidelines and new source performance
standards for the offshore oil and gas industry (58 FR 12453, March 4, 1993). Coverage of these offshore oil and gas
development and production facilities under SPA would be duplicative and unnecessary.

Section 237.3 lays out definitions to be used to interpret and implement these regulations. Some of the definitions
are the same as the definitions in SPA. Others are clarifications or additions to those definitions. Unless otherwise
noted, those terms are consistent with USCG definitions under 33 CFR part 151. The definitions proposed today that
are different or in addition to those in SPA include definitions for the terms waste source, receiving facility, operator,
owner, SPA, waste deposit, and waste transfer station.

EPA proposes to include within the coverage of this regulation a typical waste transfer from vessel to vessel (with
exceptions noted in the discussion of vessels excluded under the applicability section) by including the term ``vessel''
in the definition of waste source and the definition of receiving facility. This is clearly within the intent of the
statute. Vessels which transfer municipal or commercial waste to other vessels, unless excluded as described above,
will be required to comply with these regulations as a waste source or receiving facility (depending on whether the
transfer is loading onto or offloading from the vessel) and to clean up waste deposited into U.S. coastal waters as
a result of inadequate waste transport or transfer practices. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The definition of ``vessel'' includes non self-propelled vessels and the attendant towing vessel. This is included
to ensure that barges tied to a towing vessel are covered by these regulations. They would be considered one vessel.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The definition of ``waste source'' includes any rolling stock or motor vehicles from which waste is directly loaded
onto vessels. As explained

, once rolling stock (e.g., a garbage truck) enters a waste transfer station, the transfer station, and not the rolling
stock would be the sole waste source responsible for all appropriate waste handling practices and requirements under
these proposed regulations.

Note that the definition of ``municipal and commercial waste'' is proposed as defined in section 4103 of SPA, as ``solid
waste'' and includes solid, semi-solid, and liquid materials (as defined in section 1004 of the Solid Waste Disposal
Act, 42 U.S.C. 6903), with exceptions as defined in Section 4101(3) of SPA. It also includes waste drilling fluids
and drill cuttings.
