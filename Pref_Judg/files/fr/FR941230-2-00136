Prevention, early intervention, and effective crisis intervention are critical elements in a community's family
support system. In many communities, support services are geared toward intervention following a traumatic event,
or toward the point when a child comes into contact with the justice system as a result of repeated behavioral problems.
Over the years, OJJDP's program support and technical assistance has focused primarily on youth in the juvenile justice
system. Technical assistance and training have not generally been available to community organizations and agencies
focused upon prevention services or early intervention initiatives. Currently, training is being provided to communities
interested in implementing risk-focused prevention. Following this training, communities will be better able
to apply for and use Title V funds to support prevention programs.

Title V funds, along with funds available through the State Challenge Activities Grant Program, will provide resources
through State agency recipients of formula grant funds for jurisdictions and communities wanting to strengthen
family support services, develop services where gaps exist, or augment and retool existing services to respond to
new populations. In fiscal year 1995, OJJDP proposes to support a program to provide technical assistance and training
to public and private nonprofit agencies and organizations interested in structuring or enhancing family strengthening
program models in communities where such services are designed as part of community-wide efforts to prevent delinquency
and reduce violence. Such assistance would be offered for a selected number of family support models that have been
demonstrated to be effective in diverse communities. OJJDP will award a competitive grant to an organization experienced
in this area of expertise to provide these services.

OJJDP will provide additional training in fiscal year 1995 for communities interested in developing a risk-focused
delinquency prevention strategy. This training is designed to support OJJDP's Title V Delinquency Prevention Program
and similar federally funded programs by providing the knowledge and skills necessary for local, State, and private
agency officials and citizens to identify and address risk factors that are known to lead to violent and delinquent
behavior in children and youth. In fiscal year 1994 this training was offered in all 50 States and the District of Columbia,
and to State and local officials engaged in planning associated with Department of Health and Human Services prevention
programs.

OJJDP will award a contract to provide the training, including the following: (1) Orientation training on risk and
resiliency focused prevention theories and strategies for State, local and private community leaders, (2) identifying,
assessing, and addressing risk factors, (3) training for trainers in selected States to provide statewide capacity
to train communities on risk-focused prevention, and (4) development of training curricula, materials, and media
to increase the capacity of States and localities to conduct risk-focused prevention training. This training would
be provided through a competitive contract award.
