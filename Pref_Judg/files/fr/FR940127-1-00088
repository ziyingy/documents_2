(1) For Indian forest lands located on an Indian reservation, a written expenditure plan for the use of forest management
deductions shall be prepared annually and approved by the authorized tribal representative(s) and the Secretary.
The approval of the expenditure plan by the authorized tribal representatives constitutes appropriation of tribal

authority for crediting of forest management deductions to tribal account(s). The full amount of any deduction collected
by the Secretary plus any income or interest earned thereon shall be available for expenditure according to the approved
expenditure plan for the performance of forest land management activities on the reservation from which the forest
management deduction is collected.
