EPA's approach for the identification of response resources for non-petroleum oil facilities is adapted from, and
consistent with, the U.S. Coast Guard's (USCG) interim final rule establishing response plan requirements under
the OPA for owners and operators of marine-transportation-related, non-petroleum oil facilities. (See 33 CFR part
154. The docket includes a chart comparing USCG plan resource requirements for petroleum and non-petroleum oil facilities,
and referencing the applicable sections of the USCG facility response plan rule.) As with the USCG Interim Final Rule,
the EPA approach gives these facility owners and operators substantial latitude in calculating required response
resources for their non-petroleum facilities. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
To calculate resources for non-petroleum oil facilities, an owner or operator is not limited to using emulsification
or evaporation factors in Appendix E (the Equipment Appendix) of the Final Rule, as required for petroleum oil facilities.
Rather, these owners and operators must: (1) show procedures and strategies for responding to the maximum extent
practicable to a worst case discharge; (2) show sources of equipment and supplies necessary to locate, recover, and
mitigate discharges; (3) demonstrate that the equipment identified in the plan will work under the conditions and
in the areas that the plan covers, and reach the area within required times; and (4) ensure the availability of required
resources by contract or other approved means. EPA does not prescribe the type and amount of equipment that response
plans for non-petroleum oil discharges must identify (See Section 7.7 of Appendix E to 40 CFR part 112).

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
EPA's Final Rule is consistent with the CWA section 311(j)(5) (as amended by section 4202(a) of the OPA), which requires
facility response plans to ``remove to the maximum extent practicable'' a worst case discharge of oil or a hazardous
substance. In many responses to discharges of oil, response personnel may need to employ containment boom, skimmers,
or other equipment to contain oil and remove oil from water. Responders also may employ other strategies appropriate
for the area. These strategies apply to all oils and do not distinguish among types of oil (i.e., petroleum and non-petroleum
or toxic and non-toxic oils). 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
As EPA stated in the Final Rule (59 FR 34088), when results from research on such factors as emulsification or evaporation
of non-petroleum oil are available, the Agency may change the rule regarding the type of response resources for which
an owner or operator of a non-petroleum oil facility must plan.

II. The Organizations' Petition

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
By a letter dated August 12, 1994, EPA received a ``Petition for Reconsideration and Stay of Effective Date'' of the
OPA-mandated facility response plan Final Rule as that rule applies to facilities that handle, store, or transport
animal fat or vegetable oils. The Petition was submitted on behalf of seven agricultural organizations (``the Organizations''
or ``Petitioners''): the American Soybean Association, the Corn Refiners Association, the National Corn Growers
Association, the Institute of Shortening &amp; Edible Oils, the National Cotton Council, the National Cottonseed
Products Association, and the National Oilseed Processors Association.

To support their Petition, the Organizations reference an industry-sponsored study titled ``Environmental Effects
of Release of Animal Fats and Vegetable Oils to Waterways'' (prepared by ENVIRON Corporation, June 28, 1993) and an
associated study titled ``Diesel Fuel, Beef Tallow, RBD Soybean Oil and Crude Soybean Oil: Acute Effects on the Fathead
Minnow,

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 (prepared by Aqua Survey, Inc., May 21, 1993). Both of these studies had been submitted to EPA during the facility response
plan rulemaking as enclosures to a comment filed over nine months after the close of the comment period. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The ENVIRON study concludes that ``animal fats and vegetable oils are significantly different from petroleum oils
in their effects on the aquatic environment and so merit separate treatment in environmental regulations.'' Among
other things, ENVIRON concludes that ``animal fat and vegetable oils are orders of magnitude less toxic than petroleum
oils to aquatic life;'' that ``there are no accumulating or otherwise harmful components in animal fats and vegetable
oils that are irritating, toxic or carcinogenic;'' and that ``animal fats and vegetable oils are easily biodegraded
by bacteria using them as food.'' The study also concludes that these oils can coat aquatic biota and foul wildlife,
causing hypothermia when fur or feathers mat; and that these oils have a high ``Biological Oxygen Demand'' (or BOD),
which may result in oxygen deprivation where there is a large spill in a confined body of water with a low flow and low
dilution rate. The ENVIRON study's ultimate conclusion is that animal fats and vegetable oils are sufficiently different
from petroleum oils and other hazardous materials that they merit separate treatment in environmental regulations.

The Aqua Survey, Inc. study presents the results of Aqua Survey's tests of the acute toxicity of the test substances
on the Fathead minnow at five concentrations of each test substance. Based on the study results, the Organizations
assert that animal fats and vegetable oils_unlike petroleum-based oil and toxic non-petroleum oils_``are non-toxic,
readily biodegradable, not persistent in the environment, and, in fact, are essential components of human and wildlife
diet.''
