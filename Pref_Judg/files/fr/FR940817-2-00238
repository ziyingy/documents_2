<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
In a prospective study design, a healthy 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
group of people is assembled and followed forward in time and observed for the development 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
of disease. Such studies are invaluable for determining the time course for development of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
disease (e.g., followup studies performed in various cities on the effects of lead on child 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
development). This approach allows the direct estimate of risks attributed to a particular 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
exposure since disease incidence rates in the cohort are determined and allows the study of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
chronic effects of exposure. One major strength of the cohort design is that it allows the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
calculation of rates to determine the excess risk associated with an exposure. Also, biases 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
are reduced by obtaining information before the disease develops. This approach, however, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
can be very time-consuming and costly. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In cohort studies information bias can be introduced when individuals provide 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
distorted information about their health because they know their exposure status and may 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
have been told of the expected health effects of the exposure under study. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
A special type of cohort study is the retrospective cohort study in which the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
investigator goes back in time to select the study groups and traces them over time, often to 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the present. The studies usually involve specially exposed groups and have provided much 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
assistance in estimating risks due to occupational exposures. Occupational retrospective 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
cohort studies rely on company records of past and current employees that include 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
information on the dates of employment, age at employment, date of departure, and whether 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
diseased (or dead in the case of mortality studies). Workers can then be classified by 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
duration and degree of exposure. A retrospective cohort study was performed in which a 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
cohort of 1,790 bricklayers and 2,601 men exposed to paint solvents was retrospectively 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
identified and, if a disability pension had been awarded, the subjects were examined for 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
evidence of presenile dementia. This study found a rate ratio of 3.4 for presenile dementia 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
among the painters as compared with the bricklayers (Johnson, 1987).

3.4.2. Human Laboratory Exposure Studies

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Neurotoxicity assessment has an advantage not afforded the evaluation of other toxic 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
endpoints, such as cancer or reproductive toxicity, in that the effects of some chemicals are 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
short in duration and reversible. Under certain circumstances, it is ethically possible to 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
perform human laboratory exposure studies and obtain data relevant to the risk assessment 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
process. Information from experimental human exposure studies has been used to set 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
occupational exposure limits, mostly for organic solvents that can be inhaled. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Laboratory exposure studies have contributed to risk assessment and the setting of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
exposure limits for several solvents and other chemicals with acute reversible effects. These 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
chemicals include methylene chloride, perchloroethylene, trichloroethylene, and p-xylene 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(Dick and Johnson, 1986). 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Human exposure studies offer advantages over epidemiologic field studies. Combined 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
with appropriate biological sampling (breath or blood), it is possible to calculate body 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
concentrations, to examine toxicokinetics, and identify metabolites. Bioavailability, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
elimination, dose-related changes in metabolic pathways, individual variability, time course 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
of effects, interactions between chemicals, interactions between chemical and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
environmental/biobehavioral factors (stressors, workload/respiratory rate) are some processes 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
that can be evaluated in laboratory studies. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Other goals of laboratory studies include the indepth characterization of effects, the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
development of new assessment methods, and the examination of the sensitivity, specificity, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
and reliability of neurobehavioral assessment methods across chemical classes. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The laboratory is the most appropriate setting for the study of environmental and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
biobehavioral variables that affect the action of chemical agents. The effects of ambient 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
temperature, task difficulty, the rate of ongoing behavior, conditioning variables, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
tolerance/sensitization, sleep deprivation, motivation, etc., can be studied.
