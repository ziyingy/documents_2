SUMMARY:
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
 This rule prescribes special late season migratory bird hunting regulations for certain tribes on Federal Indian
reservations, off-reservation trust lands and ceded lands. This is in response to tribal requests for Service recognition
of their authority to regulate hunting under established guidelines. This rule is necessary to allow establishment
of season bag limits and, thus, harvest at levels compatible with populations and habitat conditions.

), authorizes and directs the Secretary of the Interior, having due regard for the zones of temperature and for the
distribution, abundance, economic value, breeding habits, and times and lines of flight of migratory game birds,
to determine when, to what extent, and by what means such birds or any part, nest or egg thereof may be taken, hunted,
captured, killed, possessed, sold, purchased, shipped, carried, exported or transported.

 (59 FR 42017), the U. S. Fish and Wildlife Service (Service) proposed special migratory bird hunting regulations
for the 1994&hyph;95 hunting season for certain Indian tribes, under the guidelines described in the June 4, 1985,

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 (50 FR 23467). The guidelines were developed in response to tribal requests for Service recognition of their reserved
hunting rights, and for some tribes, recognition of their authority to regulate hunting by both tribal members and
nonmembers on their reservations. The guidelines include possibilities for: (1) On-reservation hunting by both
tribal members and nonmembers, with hunting by nontribal members on some reservations to take place within Federal
frameworks but on dates different from those selected by the surrounding State(s); (2) on-reservation hunting by
tribal members only, outside of usual Federal frameworks for season dates and length, and for daily bag and possession
limits; and (3) off-reservation hunting by tribal members on ceded lands, outside of usual framework dates and season
length, with some added flexibility in daily bag and possession limits. In all cases, the regulations established
under the guidelines would have to be consistent with the March 10&hyph;September 1 closed season mandated by the
1916 Convention on the Protection of Migratory Birds Between the U.S. and Great Britain (for Canada). Tribes that
desired special hunting regulations in the 1994&hyph;95 hunting season were requested in the April 7, 1994, 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 -->
Federal Register
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 (59 FR 16762) to submit a proposal that included details on: (1) requested season dates and other regulations to be
observed; (2) harvest anticipated under the requested regulations; (3) methods that will be employed to measure
or monitor harvest; (4) steps that will be taken to limit level of harvest, where it could be shown that failure to limit
such harvest would impact seriously on the migratory bird resource; and (5) tribal capabilities to establish and
enforce migratory bird hunting regulations. No action is required if a tribe wishes to observe the hunting regulations
that are established by the State(s) in which an Indian reservation is located. The guidelines have been used successfully
since the 1985&hyph;86 hunting season, and they were made final beginning with the 1988&hyph;89 hunting season (August
18, 1988; 53 FR 31612).
