SUMMARY: 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
The Coast Guard proposes to establish regulated navigation areas (RNAs) within the San Francisco Bay Region in the
waters of the Golden Gate, Central Bay, Lower Bay, San Pablo Bay and Carquinez Strait. This action is necessary due
to vessel congestion in areas where maneuvering room is limited. These RNAs will increase navigation safety in the
San Francisco Bay Region by organizing traffic flow patterns; reducing meeting, crossing, and overtaking situations
between large vessels in constricted channels; and limiting vessel speed. The proposed rulemaking will also remove
existing regulatory language relating to the Pinole Shoal Channel which will be incorporated into the RNA.

The Coast Guard encourages interested persons to participate in this proposed rulemaking by submitting written
data, views, or arguments. Persons submitting comments should include their names and addresses, identify this
rulemaking (CGD11&hyph;94&hyph;007) and the specific section of the proposal to which each comment applies, and
give the reason for each comment. The coast Guard requests that all comments and attachments be submitted in an unbound
format suitable for copying and electronic filing. If not practical, a second copy of any bound materials is requested.
Persons wanting acknowledgement of receipt of comments should enclose a stamped, self-addressed postcard or envelope.
The Coast Guard will consider all comments received during the comment period. It may change this proposal in view
of the comments.

Background and Purpose
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
In 1972, the Coast Guard, with input from various members of the San Francisco Bay maritime community, established
voluntary vessel traffic routing measures for the San Francisco Bay region that consisted of traffic lanes in the
Golden Gate and the Central Bay extending to Pinole Shoal Channel; separation zones; a precautionary area east of
Alcatraz Island; and an Oakland Harbor Limited Traffic Area. Compliance with these routing measures was voluntary
and intended for use by vessels 300 gross tons or greater.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In 1991, the precautionary area east of Alcatraz Island was expanded to include the water area between the San Francisco
waterfront and Treasure Island, replacing the traffic lanes in that area. A deep water route was established north
of Harding Rock.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In 1993, the Coast Guard, with input from the Harbor Safety Committee of the San Francisco Bay Region, modified the
voluntary traffic routing measures to better conform to International Maritime Organization (IMO) traffic routing
standards. The 1993 modification added a Golden Gate precautionary area, a deep water traffic lane separation zone
north of Harding Rock and an expanded Central Bay precautionary area. It eliminated the traffic lanes in the North
Ship Cannel and San Pablo Strait.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The presence of numerous recreational boats, windsurfers, and commercial fishing boats that transit the proposed
RNAs poses a navigational hazard for vessels of 1600 or more gross tons which are constrained by their draft and maneuvering
capabilities. By limiting or requiring the use of established traffic lanes, this rule will relieve congestion and
promote safer transiting of the RNAs by vessels with restricted maneuverability. It will make the present voluntary
traffic measures mandatory and require vessels 1600 gross tons or more, or tugs with a tow of 1600 gross tons or more,
to follow traffic measures similar to those currently used on a voluntary basis. The regulation will also define precautionary
areas and establish overtaking, meeting, crossing and speed restrictions for certain vessels transiting specific
channels within the RNAs. The RNAs defined in this proposal are each considered to constitute a narrow channel or fairway.
Therefore, Rule 9 of the Inland Navigation Rules (INRs) (33 U.S.C. 2009), in conjunction with the provisions of the
associated INRs, is specifically made applicable within the defined RNAs and will be enforced.

Discussion of Proposed Regulations
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The proposed RNAs, which lie within the San Francisco VTS are (33 CFR 161.50), are as follows: San Francisco Bay RNA,
North Ship Channel RNA, San Pablo Strait Channel RNA, Pinole Shoal Channel RNA, Southern Pacific Railroad Bridge
RNA, Southhampton Shoal/Richmond Harbor RNA, and Oakland Harbor RNA.

General Requirements for All Proposed RNAs
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The depth of the water and geography of the San Francisco Bay Region, and the density of vessel traffic, which includes
numerous ferries and recreational boats, severely constrain the ability of a vessel to maneuver in the event of an
emergency. This proposed regulation will limit the maximum speed within the RNAs to 15 knots through the water for
vessels 1600 gross tons or greater, or a tug with a tow of 1600 gross tons or greater, and requires those vessels to operate
their engine(s) in a control mode and on fuel that will allow for an immediate response to any engine order, ahead or
astern, including stopping its engine(s) for an extended period of time. Limiting vessel speeds to 15 knots or less
through the water within the prescribed RNAs will reduce the risk of serious maritime accidents.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
There may be situations where vessels would be unable to safely comply with the requirements of this regulation. In
such cases, the Captain of the Port, or the Commanding Officer, VTS San Francisco, acting as a representative of the
Captain of the Port, may allow a vessel to deviate from this regulation.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

The RNAs defined in this proposal are each considered to constitute a narrow channel or fairway. Therefore, Rule 9
of the Inland Navigation Rules (INRs) (33 U.S.C. 2009), in conjunction with the provisions of the associated INRs,
is specifically made applicable within the defined RNAs and will be enforced.
