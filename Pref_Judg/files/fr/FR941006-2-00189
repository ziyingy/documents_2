<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Concept papers are an extremely important part of the application process because they enable the Institute to learn
the program areas of primary interest to the courts and to explore innovative ideas, without imposing heavy burdens
on prospective applicants. The use of concept papers also permits the Institute to better project the nature and amount
of grant awards. This requirement and the submission deadlines for concept papers and applications may be waived
for good cause (e.g., the proposed project would provide a significant benefit to the State courts or the opportunity
to conduct the project did not arise until after the deadline).

A. Format and Content 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
All concept papers must include a cover sheet, a program narrative, and a preliminary budget, regardless of whether
the applicant is proposing a single project or a ``package of projects,'' or whether the applicant is requesting accelerated
award of a grant of less than $40,000.

section II.B.1.) that the proposed project addresses most directly; and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Applicants requesting the Board to waive the application requirement and approve a grant of less than $40,000 based

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
 Concept Papers Proposing a Single Project
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
. The program narrative of a concept paper describing a single project should be no longer than necessary, but 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
in no case should exceed eight (8) double-spaced pages on 81/2 by 11 inch paper. Margins must not be less than 1 inch and
type no smaller than 12 point and 12 cpi must be used. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The narrative should describe: 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
i. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Why this project is needed and how it will benefit State courts? 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
If the project is to be conducted in a specific location(s), applicants should discuss the particular needs of the
project site(s) to be addressed by the project, why those needs are not being met through the use of existing materials,
programs, procedures, services or other resources, and the benefits that would be realized by the proposed sites(s).

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
If the project is not site specific, applicants should discuss the problems that the proposed project will address,
why existing materials, programs, procedures, services or other resources do not adequately resolve those problems,
and the benefits that would be realized from the project by State courts generally. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
ii. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
What will be done if a grant is awarded? 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
A summary description of the project to be conducted and the approach to be taken, including the anticipated length
of the grant period. Applicants requesting a waiver of the application requirement for a grant of less than $40,000
should explain the proposed methods for conducting the project as fully as space allows.

iii. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
How the effects and quality of the project will be determined? 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
A summary description of how the project will be evaluated, including the evaluation criteria. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
iv. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
How others will find out about the project and be 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
able to use the results? 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
A description of the products that will result, the degree to which they will be applicable to courts across the nation,
and the manner in which the products and results of the project will be disseminated.

Concept Papers Requesting a Package Grant Covering More Than One Project. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The program narrative of a concept paper requesting a package grant (see definition in section III.I.) should be no
longer than necessary, but in no case should exceed 15 double-spaced pages on 81/2 by 11 inch paper. Margins must not
be less than 1 inch, and type no smaller than 12-point and 12 cpi must be used. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In addition to addressing the issues listed in paragraph VI.A.2.a., the program narrative of a package grant concept
paper must describe briefly each component project, as well as how its inclusion enhances the entire package; and
explain: 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
i. How are the proposed projects related? 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
ii. How would their operation and administration be enhanced if they were funded as a package rather than as individual
projects; and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
iii. What disadvantages, if any, would accrue by considering or funding them separately. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
