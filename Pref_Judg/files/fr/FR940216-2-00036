<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Pursuant to Public Law 97-415, the U.S. Nuclear Regulatory Commission (the Commission or NRC staff) is publishing
this regular biweekly notice. Public Law 97-415 revised section 189 of the Atomic Energy Act of 1954, as amended (the
Act), to require the Commission to publish notice of any amendments issued, or proposed to be issued, under a new provision
of section 189 of the Act. This provision grants the Commission the authority to issue and make immediately effective
any amendment to an operating license upon a determination by the Commission that such amendment involves no significant
hazards consideration, notwithstanding the pendency before the Commission of a request for a hearing from any person.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
This biweekly notice includes all notices of amendments issued, or proposed to be issued from January 22, 1994, through
February 4, 1994. The last biweekly notice was published on February 2, 1994 (59 FR 4933).

Notice Of Consideration Of Issuance Of Amendments To Facility Operating Licenses, Proposed No Significant Hazards
Consideration Determination, And Opportunity For A Hearing
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Commission has made a proposed determination that the following amendment requests involve no significant hazards
consideration. Under the Commission's regulations in 10 CFR 50.92, this means that operation of the facility in accordance
with the proposed amendment would not (1) involve a significant increase in the probability or consequences of an
accident previously evaluated; or (2) create the possibility of a new or different kind of accident from any accident
previously evaluated; or (3) involve a significant reduction in a margin of safety. The basis for this proposed determination
for each amendment request is shown below. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Commission is seeking public comments on this proposed determination. Any comments received within 30 days after
the date of publication of this notice will be considered in making any final determination. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Normally, the Commission will not issue the amendment until the expiration of the 30-day notice period. However,
should circumstances change during the notice period such that failure to act in a timely way would result, for example,
in derating or shutdown of the facility, the Commission may issue the license amendment before the expiration of the
30-day notice period, provided that its final determination is that the amendment involves no significant hazards
consideration. The final determination will consider all public and State comments received before action is taken.
Should the Commission take this action, it will publish in the 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 -->
Federal Register 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
a notice of issuance and provide for opportunity for a hearing after issuance. The Commission expects that the need
to take this action will occur very infrequently. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Written comments may be submitted by mail to the Rules Review and Directives Branch, Division of Freedom of Information
and Publications Services, Office of Administration, U.S. Nuclear Regulatory Commission, Washington, DC 20555,
and should cite the publication date and page number of this 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

notice. Written comments may also be delivered to Room P-223, Phillips Building, 7920 Norfolk Avenue, Bethesda,
Maryland from 7:30 a.m. to 4:15 p.m. Federal workdays. Copies of written comments received may be examined at the NRC
Public Document Room, the Gelman Building, 2120 L Street, NW., Washington, DC 20555. The filing of requests for a hearing
and petitions for leave to intervene is discussed below.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
By March 18, 1994, the licensee may file a request for a hearing with respect to issuance of the amendment to the subject
facility operating license and any person whose interest may be affected by this proceeding and who wishes to participate
as a party in the proceeding must file a written request for a hearing and a petition for leave to intervene. Requests
for a hearing and a petition for leave to intervene shall be filed in accordance with the Commission's ``Rules of Practice
for Domestic Licensing Proceedings'' in 10 CFR Part 2. Interested persons should consult a current copy of 10 CFR 2.714
which is available at the Commission's Public Document Room, the Gelman Building, 2120 L Street, NW., Washington,
DC 20555 and at the local public document room for the particular facility involved. If a request for a hearing or petition
for leave to intervene is filed by the above date, the Commission or an Atomic Safety and Licensing Board, designated
by the Commission or by the Chairman of the Atomic Safety and Licensing Board Panel, will rule on the request and/or
petition; and the Secretary or the designated Atomic Safety and Licensing Board will issue a notice of a hearing or
an appropriate order. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
As required by 10 CFR 2.714, a petition for leave to intervene shall set forth with particularity the interest of the
petitioner in the proceeding, and how that interest may be affected by the results of the proceeding. The petition
should specifically explain the reasons why intervention should be permitted with particular reference to the following
factors: (1) the nature of the petitioner's right under the Act to be made a party to the proceeding; (2) the nature and
extent of the petitioner's property, financial, or other interest in the proceeding; and (3) the possible effect
of any order which may be entered in the proceeding on the petitioner's interest. The petition should also identify
the specific aspect(s) of the subject matter of the proceeding as to which petitioner wishes to intervene. Any person
who has filed a petition for leave to intervene or who has been admitted as a party may amend the petition without requesting
leave of the Board up to 15 days prior to the first prehearing conference scheduled in the proceeding, but such an amended
petition must satisfy the specificity requirements described above.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Not later than 15 days prior to the first prehearing conference scheduled in the proceeding, a petitioner shall file
a supplement to the petition to intervene which must include a list of the contentions which are sought to be litigated
in the matter. Each contention must consist of a specific statement of the issue of law or fact to be raised or controverted.
In addition, the petitioner shall provide a brief explanation of the bases of the contention and a concise statement
of the alleged facts or expert opinion which support the contention and on which the petitioner intends to rely in proving
the contention at the hearing. The petitioner must also provide references to those specific sources and documents
of which the petitioner is aware and on which the petitioner intends to rely to establish those facts or expert opinion.
Petitioner must provide sufficient information to show that a genuine dispute exists with the applicant on a material
issue of law or fact. Contentions shall be limited to matters within the scope of the amendment under consideration.
The contention must be one which, if proven, would entitle the petitioner to relief. A petitioner who fails to file
such a supplement which satisfies these requirements with respect to at least one contention will not be permitted
to participate as a party. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Those permitted to intervene become parties to the proceeding, subject to any limitations in the order granting leave
to intervene, and have the opportunity to participate fully in the conduct of the hearing, including the opportunity
to present evidence and cross-examine witnesses. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
If a hearing is requested, the Commission will make a final determination on the issue of no significant hazards consideration.
The final determination will serve to decide when the hearing is held. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
If the final determination is that the amendment request involves no significant hazards consideration, the Commission
may issue the amendment and make it immediately effective, notwithstanding the request for a hearing. Any hearing
held would take place after issuance of the amendment. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
If the final determination is that the amendment request involves a significant hazards consideration, any hearing
held would take place before the issuance of any amendment. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
A request for a hearing or a petition for leave to intervene must be filed with the Secretary of the Commission, U.S.
Nuclear Regulatory Commission, Washington, DC 20555, Attention: Docketing and Services Branch, or may be delivered
to the Commission's Public Document Room, the Gelman Building, 2120 L Street, NW., Washington DC 20555, by the above
date. Where petitions are filed during the last 10 days of the notice period, it is requested that the petitioner promptly
so inform the Commission by a toll-free telephone call to Western Union at 1-(800) 248-5100 (in Missouri 1-(800) 342-6700).
The Western Union operator should be given Datagram Identification Number N1023 and the following message addressed
to

notice. A copy of the petition should also be sent to the Office of the General Counsel, U.S. Nuclear Regulatory Commission,
Washington, DC 20555, and to the attorney for the licensee. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Nontimely filings of petitions for leave to intervene, amended petitions, supplemental petitions and/or requests
for a hearing will not be entertained absent a determination by the Commission, the presiding officer or the Atomic
Safety and Licensing Board that the petition and/or request should be granted based upon a balancing of factors specified
in 10 CFR 2.714(a)(1)(i)-(v) and 2.714(d).

Description of amendment request:

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The proposed amendment would implement Line Item 5.9 of NRC Generic Letter 93-05, ``Line Item Technical Specification
Improvements to Reduce Surveillance Requirements for Testing During Power Operation,'' which recommends licensees
consider deleting the requirements to perform response time testing for selected instrumentation in the isolation
system where the required time corresponds to the diesel start time.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Basis for proposed no significant hazards consideration determination: 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
As required by 10 CFR 50.91(a), the licensee has provided its analysis of the issue of no significant hazards consideration,
which is presented below:
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->
LaSalle has evaluated the proposed Technical Specification Amendment. Based upon the criteria for defining a Significant
Hazards Consideration established in 10 CFR 50.92(c), operation of LaSalle County Station in accordance with the
proposed amendment will not:
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
1) Involve a significant increase in the probability or consequences of an accident previously evaluated because:
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The proposal seeks to eliminate response time testing requirements for selected instrumentation in the isolation
system. The proposal does not introduce changes in the response times themselves. The probability and consequences
of an accident previously evaluated are not increased because accepted licensing criteria are maintained. The requirements
for channel checks, functional tests, calibrations, and logic system functional tests are not altered by this proposal.
The ability to detect degrading trends of response times is available via the above Technical Specification required
tests. Therefore, the response times of these systems will be maintained within the acceptance limits assumed in
plant safety analyses and required for successful mitigation of an initiating event because of the continued Technical
Specification testing.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
2) Create the possibility of a new or different kind of accident from any accident previously evaluated because:
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The proposal does not change component or system interactions. Accident analyses assume a loss of AC power which is
restored by startup of emergency diesel generators. The 13 second interval associated with the restoration of AC
power, which establishes the response time for the isolation functions, is maintained. The starting, sequencing,
and loading functions associated with the diesel generators is not affected by the proposed change. The response
times include the instrument response times, which are typically measured in fractions of a second, and the response
times of the actuation logic circuits, which are typically less than a second. These times are small in comparison
to the diesel generator start time (13 seconds). The ability of the isolation system to perform its intended function
to mitigate the consequences of an initiating event within the acceptance limits assumed in plant safety analyses
is not altered by the proposed change.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
3) Involve a significant reduction in a margin of safety because:
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The proposal does not involve the relaxation of any criteria identified in the SAR or reduce any of the requirements
of Technical Specifications. The proposed revision does not affect licensing acceptance limits associated with
accidents. With the exception of MSIVs, the safety analyses do not address individual sensor response times or the
response times of the logic systems to which the sensors are connected. These analyses conservatively establish
the margin of safety. Deleting the requirement to perform unnecessary response time testing does not affect the results
of accident and transient analyses. Plant and system response to an initiating event will remain in compliance within
the assumptions of safety analyses. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The proposed change does not increase the probability or consequences of an accident, and there is no impact on equipment
important to safety or systems, structures or components. There is no associated change to the type, amount, or control
of radioactive effluents, nor is there an associated increase in individual or cumulative occupational radiation
exposure. There is no effect upon the capabilities of the associated systems to perform their intended functions
within the allowed response times assumed in safety analyses. Therefore, the margin of safety is preserved.

Fuel Rods'' and its associated BASES Section 3/4.4.12.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Basis for proposed no significant hazards consideration determination: 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
As required by 10 CFR 50.91(a), the licensee has provided its analysis of the issue of no significant hazards consideration
(SHC), which is presented below:
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->
The proposed changes do not involve an SHC consideration because the changes would not:
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
1. Involve a significant increase in the probability or consequences of an accident previously evaluated.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
A review of the accidents detailed in the Updated Final Safety Analysis Report, Chapter 15, was undertaken to determine
if they were impacted by the proposed change. The review indicated that the previously evaluated accidents were not
impacted by the proposed license amendment.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
All fuel design and performance criteria are the same for Cycle 18 as in previous cycles. All criteria will continue
to be met and no new single-failure mechanisms will be created. This change does not involve any alterations to plant
equipment or procedures which would affect any operational modes or accident assumptions. This proposed license
amendment does delete a technical specification that is no longer considered necessary. This deletion is prompted
by the replacement of stainless steel clad fuel with zircaloy clad fuel. The zircaloy clad fuel, if it experiences
damage, will release iodine into the primary system. Any iodine released is covered within the guidelines specified
in the existing Technical Specification 3/4.4.8, ``Specific Activity.'' This specification will ensure that operation
does not continue with radiochemistry values that exceed those assumed in our accident assumptions. The existing
Technical Specification of specific activity along with the zircaloy clad fuel will ensure that a significant increase
in the probability or consequences of an accident previously evaluated is not present.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
2. Create the possibility of a new or different kind of accident from any previously analyzed.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The possibility of an accident or malfunction of a different type than any evaluated previously in the UFSAR [Updated
Final Safety Analysis Report] is not created. Since there are no changes in the way the plant is operated, the potential
for an unanalyzed accident is not created. No new failure modes are introduced.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The presence of defective fuel rods and the resultant iodine release would only affect potential offsite doses. This
proposed license amendment does not increase the radiochemistry limits, but does revert the technical specifications
back to the standard methodology and limitations that were unable to be used because of the stainless steel clad fuel.
These new limitations will continue to ensure that doses remain within the limits prescribed.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
3. Involve a significant reduction in a margin of safety.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The proposed changes do not have any adverse impact on the protective boundaries. The margin of safety, as defined
in the basis for any technical specification, is not reduced. The proposed changes do not adversely impact any of the
safety systems, nor do they increase the number of challenges to the safety systems.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The limit of 160 defective rods was chosen to be consistent with initial conditions assumed for the radiological design
basis. The elimination of this specification is acceptable since the basis for the initial condition can be supported
by the use of zircaloy clad fuel as opposed to the unique stainless steel clad. If future fuel defects are debris induced,
the dose equivalent iodine will be within expected radiochemistry values and the resulting doses will be bounded.
Therefore, there is no reduction in the margin of safety as defined in the basis of any technical specification with
the deletion of the defective fuel rod technical specification.

Basis for proposed no significant hazards consideration determination: 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
As required by 10 CFR 50.91(a), the licensee has provided its analysis of the issue of no significant hazards consideration,
which is presented below:
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->
The proposed change does not involve a significant hazards consideration since:
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
1. There is no significant increase in the probability or consequences of an accident.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Approval of the proposed one time change to the Technical Specification definition of cold shutdown for purposes
of performing the full RCS [reactor coolant system] chemical decontamination without fuel in the reactor would provide
relief from unnecessary technical specification action statements that are based on fuel in the reactor. Credible
accidents with significant consequences are practically eliminated with the removal of the reactor fuel during
the performance of the FSD [full reactor coolant system chemical decontamination]. In addition, specific actions
would be taken in accordance with the requirements of the NRC approved WCAP-12932-A Rev. 2 to ensure that RCS and affected
interfacing systems integrity are preserved. Thus, system capability within established accident scenarios would
not be compromised. The proposed amendment would therefore not involve a significant increase in the probability
or consequences of an accident previously evaluated.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
2. The possibility of a new or different kind of accident from any previously analyzed has not been created.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
As noted above, the proposed amendment seeks to eliminate unnecessary Technical Specification action requirements
during the performance of full RCS chemical decontamination. These actions are unnecessary because there will be
no fuel in the reactor and the RCS and other affected systems will be operated under conditions well within their design
capability during the implementation of this process. In addition, the FSD effort will be conducted in accordance
with the requirement(s) of the NRC approved Westinghouse topical report WCAP-12932-A Rev. 2. Accidents involving
failures of the decontamination process system will not exceed the bounding conditions for any previously established
accidents involving failure of a radwaste system. Accordingly, the possibility of a new or different kind of accident
from any previously analyzed will not be created.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
3. There has been no reduction in the margin of safety.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The proposed amendment provides relief from technical specification actions in the performance of the FSD which
become unnecessary when there is no fuel in the reactor. The change will not adversely impact any Technical Specification
required systems, structures or components. The design capability of systems, structures or components impacted
will not be reduced. Consequently, no significant reduction in the margin of safety for any system, structure, or
component is involved.

Description of amendment request: 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The proposed amendments remove the tables of containment penetration conductor overcurrent protective devices
from the Technical Specifications (TS) in accordance with the guidance contained in Generic Letter 91-08, ``Removal
of Component Lists from Technical Specifications.'' The tables would be relocated to Chapter 16 of the Catawba Final
Safety Analysis Report (Selected Licensee Commitments Manual). In addition, the licensee proposes the removal
of an obsolete footnote to TS 4.8.4. The footnote, which made TS 4.8.4.a initially effective following the first refueling
outage of Unit 1, is no longer needed.

Criterion 1
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The requested amendments will not involve a significant increase in the probability or consequences of an accident
previously evaluated. Relocating the component lists of containment penetration conductor overcurrent protective
devices from the technical specifications to the [Selected Licensee Commitments] SLC Manual (with all attendant
required technical specification changes as described previously and also including removal of the above described
obsolete footnote) has no impact upon either the probability or consequences of any accident. No plant equipment
is affected by the proposed change. No equipment is being added or deleted from the lists; only the source document
for the lists is being changed. Any future changes to the lists (i.e., changes to the plant) will be subject to the provisions
of 10CFR50.59 and also subject to the change control provisions of Chapter 6 of Catawba's Technical Specifications.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Criterion 2
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The requested amendments will not create the possibility of a new or different kind of accident from any accident previously
evaluated. No accident causal mechanisms are affected by the proposed change, as no change to the plant is being proposed.
In addition, no change to the manner in which the plant is operated is being made. Finally, no changes to plant procedures
are being made which would affect any accident causal mechanisms.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Criterion 3
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The requested amendments will not involve a significant reduction in a margin of safety. The proposed change has no
impact upon any safety margin. The proposed change is consistent with the guidance provided in Generic Letter 91-08
and the control provisions utilized as a result of relocating the subject component lists are at least as stringent
as those set forth in the generic letter.

Basis for proposed no significant hazards consideration determination: 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
As required by 10 CFR 50.91(a), the licensee has provided its analysis of the issue of no significant hazards consideration,
which is presented below:
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 -->
(1) This amendment will not significantly increase the probability or consequence of any accident previously evaluated.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->
No component modification, system realignment, or change in operating procedure will occur which could affect the
probability of any accident or transient. The change in method of flow measurement will not change the probability
of actuation of any Engineered Safeguard Feature or other device. The actual flow rate will not change. The consequences
of previously-analyzed accidents will not change as a result of the new method of flow measurement.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 -->
(2) This amendment will not create the possibility of any new or different accidents not previously evaluated.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->
No component modification or system realignment will occur which could create the possibility of a new event not previously
considered. The elbow taps are already in place, and are used to monitor flow for the Reactor Protection System. They
will not initiate any new events.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 -->
(3) This amendment will not involve a significant reduction in a margin of safety.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->
As described in [the licensee's application], the change in method of RCS flow measurement will provide a more accurate
indication of the flow. The actual flow rate will not be affected. The revised setpoints for low reactor coolant flow
are driven by changes to statistical allowances and do not represent substantive, or less conservative, changes.
There is no significant reduction in a margin of safety.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The proposed amendment would revise the Technical Specification (TS) for the following four items in accordance
with the guidance in Generic Letter (GL) 93-05 ``Line Item Technical Specifications Improvements To Reduce Surveillance
Requirements For Testing During Power Operation''.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
1) GL Item 5.14 Radiation Monitors will change the channel functional test from monthly to quarterly.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
2) GL Item 6.1 Reactor Coolant System (RCS) Isolation Valves will increase the time from 72 hours to 7 days for remaining
in cold shutdown without leak testing the RCS isolation valves.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
3) GL Item 6.6 Pressurizer Heaters will change the verification of capacity from at least once per 92 days to each refueling
outage and will change the demonstration of the emergency power supply from at least once per 18 months to at each refueling
outage.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
4) GL Item 9.1 Auxiliary Feedwater Pump and System Testing will change 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the frequency of these pumps from once per 31 days on a staggered basis to quarterly on a staggered bases.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
All of the above are compatible with Waterford 3 plant operating experience and are consistent with NUREG-1366, ``Improvement
To Technical Specification Surveillance Requirements,'' December 1992 and the licensing basis for Waterford 3.

Basis for proposed no significant hazards consideration determination: 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
As required by 10 CFR 50.91(a), the licensee has provided its analysis of the issue of no significant hazards consideration,
which is presented below:
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->
The proposed change to increase the radiation monitoring instrumentation channel functional test from monthly
to quarterly will have no effect on design basis accidents. The findings in NUREG-1366 determined that this change
will increase the availability of radiation monitors.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The proposed change to increase the 72 hour time for remaining in cold shutdown without leak testing the RCS isolation
valves to 7 days will not affect any design basis accidents. NUREG-1366 findings have determined that extending this
interval does not significantly alter the associated risk. In addition, the current requirement has a potential
for causing problems resulting from a hurried recovery.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The proposed change to the pressurizer heater capacity test interval from quarterly to each refueling interval will
have no affect on any design basis accidents. The TS requires at least 2 groups of pressurizer heaters each having a
nominal capacity of 150 kW. Waterford 3 has 8 groups of pressurizer heaters; two proportional groups of 150 kW each,
and 6 backup groups of 200 kW each. An evaluation of past operating experience has shown the availability of at least
6 groups of pressurizer heaters with a minimum of 150 kW each.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The proposed change to extend the testing interval for the EFW [emergency feedwater] pumps will have no affect on any
design basis accidents. The pumps will continue to be tested quarterly to the same standards applied to safety related
pumps as defined by the ASME [American Society of Mechanical Engineers] Section XI Code. Satisfactory completion
of testing in accordance with the Code is accepted as verification that safety related pumps will be available to perform
their intended function.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The proposed changes identified above are supported by the findings identified in NUREG-1366 and consistent with
the guidance provided in Generic Letter 93-05. These line-item improvements are intended to improve plant safety,
decrease equipment degradation, and remove unnecessary burden on personnel resources by reducing the amount of
testing that the TS require during power operation. Therefore, the proposed changes identified above will not involve
a significant increase in the probability or consequences of any accident previously evaluated.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The changes identified above only affect the frequency of surveillance testing. There are no changes that will alter
operation of the plant or the manner in which it is operated. Therefore, the proposed changes will not create the possibility
of a new or different kind of accident from any accident previously evaluated.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The proposed changes identified herein extend testing frequency in an effort to improve plant reliability and safety.
The proposed changes are consistent with the findings in NUREG-1366, guidance in Generic Letter 93-05 and plant operating
experience. As such, the proposed changes will preserve the established margin of safety for the affected specifications.
Therefore, the proposed changes will not involve a significant reduction in a margin of safety.

which is presented below: 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->
1. The proposed change does not involve a significant increase in the probability or consequences of an accident previously
evaluated. The proposed change involves the relocation of the TS [Technical Specification] requirements for the
turbine overspeed protection system to the VEGP [Vogtle Electric Generating Plant] FSAR [Final Safety Analysis
Report]. The requirements that will reside in the FSAR will continue to ensure that the probability of turbine missile
generation is maintained below NRC limits as defined in NUREG-1048, Appendix U. Since the turbine overspeed protection
system will remain capable of protecting the turbine from excessive overspeed, the proposed change will have no effect
on the consequences of an accident previously evaluated.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
2. The proposed change will not create the possibility of a new or different kind of accident than any previously evaluated.
The proposed change does not involve any change to the configuration or method of operation of any plant equipment,
and no new failure modes have been defined for any plant system or component. In addition, no new limiting failures
have been identified as a result of the proposed change. The requirements for the turbine overspeed protection system
that will reside in the FSAR will ensure that the system remains capable of protecting the turbine from excessive overspeed.
Therefore, the proposed change will not create the possibility of a new or different kind of accident than any previously
evaluated. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
3. The proposed change does not involve a significant reduction in a margin of safety. The proposed change would allow
the requirements for the turbine overspeed protection system to be relocated to the FSAR on the basis that the turbine
overspeed protection system does not meet the criteria of the NRC Final Policy Statement on Technical Specifications
Improvements for Nuclear Reactors. The requirements that will reside in the FSAR for the turbine overspeed protection
system will ensure that the system remains capable of protecting the turbine from excessive overspeed. Therefore,
the proposed change will not involve a significant reduction in a margin of safety.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The licensee proposes to make a one-time change to the technical specifications to add new Technical Specifications
3/4.10.6 and 3/4.10.7 to the Special Test Exemptions section. The new TS would allow the restart of Unit 2 with expired
calibrations on the core exit thermocouples (CET) and the reactor coolant system (RCS) resistance temperature detectors
(RTD). This amendment will also add a new Technical Specification to allow the ascension to 75 percent rated thermal
power with an expired precision heat balance reactor coolant flow measurement.

Basis for proposed no significant hazards consideration determination: 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
As required by 10 CFR 50.91(a), the licensee has provided its analysis of the issue of no significant hazards consideration,
which is presented below:
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->
(1)The proposed change does not involve a significant increase in the probability or consequences of a previously
evaluated accident.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The proposed change will allow the restart of [STP] Unit 2 with Core Exit Thermocouples and Reactor Coolant System
Resistance Temperature Detectors technically inoperable due to expired calibrations. The calibrations of these
instruments can only be completed when the Unit reaches Normal Operating Pressure and Normal Operating Temperature
in Mode 3. Once the calibrations of these instruments are completed, this one time change will expire and all of the
existing applicable Limiting Conditions for Operations will become effective immediately. Since industry and
South Texas Project Electric Generating Station experience has shown that the failure mechanism for these types
of instrument is complete failure as opposed to a gradual drift, and there will be calibration points to compare RTD
readings to actual RCS temperature as the RCS temperature increases, it is reasonable to expect these CETs/RTDs will
function as they did before their calibrations expired. For this reason, all applicable functions, including COMS,

the instruments being declared inoperable is their expired calibrations, this change does not involve a significant
increase in the probability or consequence of an accident previously evaluated. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The proposed change will also allow the restart of Unit 2 with the precision heat balance RCS flow measurement surveillance
expired. This surveillance is used to confirm the values indicated by the RCS flow meters. These instruments are calibrated
every 18 months and the RCS flow meters will be checked every 12 hours to ensure adequate flow prior to the completion
of the precision heat balance RCS flow measurement. Since this surveillance is only used to confirm the reading of
calibrated instruments and does not involve any changes to the design or function of the instruments, this change
does not involve a significant increase in the probability or consequence of an accident previously evaluated.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The operations of Unit 2 with the CETs and RCS RTDs technically inoperable due to expired calibrations, until these
calibrations can be completed in Mode 3, does not affect the design bases of the CETs and RCS RTDs or any of the accident
evaluations involving these instruments. Since industry and South Texas Project Electric Generating Station experience
indicates that the failure mechanism for these types of instruments is not a gradual drift but complete failure, the
reasonable expectation is the CETs/RTDs will function as they did prior to their calibrations expiring.

The RCS RTDs are auctioneered to prevent a failed high or low instrument from adversely influencing the safety of the

The proposed amendment would revise the Cooper Nuclear Station (CNS) Technical Specifications to modify the licensee's
organizational structure by removing the positions of ``Site Manager'' and ``Senior Manager of Operations.'' The
functions presently given in CNS Technical Specifications for the Site Manager position will be assumed by the Vice
President - Nuclear.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The proposed change removing the positions of Site Manager and Senior Manager of Operations from the Technical Specifications
is administrative in nature. The functions and responsibilities of the previous position of Site Manager presently
given in the plant Technical Specifications will be performed by the Vice President - Nuclear. Additionally, with
the reorganization, the Senior Manager of Operations position is eliminated and therefore, this position is also
being removed. The provision in the Technical Specifications for automatic shifting of Plant Manager responsibilities
to the Senior Manager of Operations has also been removed. The shifting of Plant Manager responsibilities (in writing)
to one of the Managers at CNS who is qualified for this position remains in the Technical Specifications. The position
removals and responsibility transfers in the organization do not affect plant design or operation, nor do they affect
the way any systems, structures, or components are operated or maintained. The individual filling the position ``Vice
President - Nuclear'' is qualified to perform the assigned tasks and responsibilities. Restructuring of the sentence
in specification 6.2.B.6, is purely an administrative change. Also, this proposed change does not alter the conditions
or assumptions in any of the Updated Safety Analysis Report (USAR) accident analyses. Since the USAR accident analyses
remain bounding, the consequences previously evaluated are not adversely affected by the proposed change. Therefore,
it can be concluded that the proposed change does not involve a significant increase in the probability or consequences
of an accident previously evaluated.

The proposed Technical Specification revision removes all references to the position title of the Site Manager.
The responsibilities of this position presently given in the Technical Specifications are being incorporated and
performed by the position ``Vice President - Nuclear.'' Additionally, with the reorganization, the Senior Manager
of Operations position is eliminated and therefore, this position is also being removed. The shifting of Plant Manager
responsibilities (in writing) to one of the Managers at CNS who is qualified for this position remains in the Technical
Specifications. All given management activities will continue to be performed by qualified individuals. Restructuring
of the sentence in specification 6.2.B.6 is purely an administrative change. This change does not affect the design
or operation of any system, structure, or component in the plant, and is considered to be an administrative change.
Accordingly, no new failure modes have been defined for any plant system or component important to safety, nor has
any new limiting failure been identified as a result of the proposed change. Therefore, this proposed change does
not create the possibility of a new or different kind of accident from any accident previously evaluated.

This proposed amendment involves a change to the Administrative Controls Section of the CNS Technical Specifications;
specifically, removal of two positions referenced in the organizational structure. The Site Manager position is
being deleted and the responsibilities of this position listed in the Technical Specifications are being performed
by the Vice President - Nuclear. Additionally, with the reorganization, the Senior Manager of Operations position
is eliminated and therefore, this position and responsibilities are also being removed. The shifting of Plant Manager
responsibilities (in writing) to one of the Managers at CNS who is qualified for this position remains in the Technical
Specifications. All given management activities, as described in the Technical Specifications, will continue
to be performed by qualified individuals. Restructuring of the sentence in specification 6.2.B.6, is purely an administrative
change. The proposed change does not adversely impact the plant's ability to meet applicable regulatory requirements.
The proposed change does not alter any means of plant operation, nor does the proposed change involve any physical
alterations to the plant and does not affect any plant safety parameters or setpoints. Therefore, this proposed change
does not involve a significant reduction in the margin of safety.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The proposed changes do not involve a significant increase in the probability or consequences of an accident previously
evaluated because the functions being removed do not contribute to avoidance of any previously evaluated accidents.
Further, the changes have been shown to have an insignificant impact on overall reactivity control failure frequency.
This insignificant impact is offset by the relatively large reduction in core damage frequency realized by the implementation
of these changes. Hence, the probability or consequences of previously evaluated accidents are not significantly
increased due to this change. To the contrary, as stated in the topical report [NEDO-31400A] the changes provide a
net improvement in overall plant safety.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The proposed amendment does not involve a physical or procedural change to any structure, component or system that
significantly affects the probability or consequences of any accident or malfunction of equipment important to
safety previously evaluated in the Final Safety Analysis Report (Updated). The proposed amendment will involve
a change to reactor protection and isolation actuation systems circuitry that will remove the automatic reactor
shutdown and Main Steam Line Isolation Valve closure functions of the Main Steam Line Radiation Monitor. However,
the physical changes will not affect the remaining scram or vessel isolation functions.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
[***T]he methods, procedures and assumptions used to perform the eneric analyses in NED0-31400A are bounding for
the Nine Mile Point Unit 1 with regard to input values. Niagara Mohawk has also provided in the evaluation reasonable
assurance that significantly increased levels of radioactivity in the main steam lines will be controlled expeditiously
to limit both occupational and environmental exposures. The Main Steam Line Radiation Monitor alarm setpoints will
be set at 1.5 times the normal full power background dose rate and should any monitor exceed its alarm setpoint, the
reactor coolant will be sampled to determine activity levels and the possible need for additional corrective actions.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The offgas radiation monitor is a more sensitive monitor than the Main Steam Line Radiation Monitor because the nitrogen-16
source, dominating the radiation signal to the Main Steam Line Radiation Monitor, has decayed by the time the radiation
monitor can be affected by any increased levels of activity. Therefore, setting the offgas radiation monitor at 1.5
times the nitrogen-16 background dose rate is not reasonable since setting the monitor that low can lead to spurious
activations of the alarm.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Nine Mile Point Unit 1's monitor configuration, as described in the FSAR, detects the concentration of the offgas
as it flows through the pipe. Thus, the detector is sensitive to fluctuations in condenser air inleakage, which can
have an appreciable impact on the monitor readings, especially at readings as low as 1.5 times the normal full power
background. Therefore, Niagara Mohawk proposes to set the alarm at five (5) times the normal full power background,
which is still very conservative compared to the value allowed by Technical Specification 3.6.15.c., which is set
based on Nine Mile Point 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Unit 1's Offsite Dose Calculation Manual.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Niagara Mohawk believes that a setting of five (5) times the normal full power background is extremely conservative
and is low enough to ensure detection of even minor fuel performance changes. Furthermore, if the monitor alarms at
this setpoint of five times the normal full power background, the offgas will immediately be sampled and analyzed,
followed by an analysis of a reactor coolant sample.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Furthermore, the analyses in the Licensing Topical Report demonstrate that removal of the automatic reactor scram
and Main Steam Line Isolation Valve closure functions of the Main Steam Line Radiation Monitor does not change the
conclusions in the Final Safety Analysis Report (Updated) that the calculated radiological release consequences
of the bounding control rod drop accident will not exceed the acceptable dose limits specified in 10CFR[Part]100.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Therefore, Niagara Mohawk concludes that the proposed amendment will not involve a significant increase in the probability
or consequences of an accident previously evaluated.

The operation of Nine Mile Point Unit 1 in accordance with the proposed amendment will not create the possibility of

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The function of a Main Steam Line Radiation Monitor trip is to detect abnormal fission produce release and isolate
the main steam lines, thereby stopping the transport of fission products from the reactor to the main condenser. The
monitors do not perform a prevention function for any kind of accident.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The main steam line high radiation scram and main steam line isolation functions were originally intended to mitigate,
not prevent, an existing accident scenario. However, the functions being removed do not contribute to avoidance
or mitigation of any previously evaluated accidents since no credit is taken for these functions in any design basis
event for terminating the initiating event or assuring the radioactive release remains within accepted limits.
The existence of a Main Steam Line Radiation Monitor trip does not prevent the occurrence of a fuel failure event or
any other type of event. Elimination of these functions will not introduce a new or different accident scenario.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The proposed amendment represents a change to the physical configuration of the plant in that some reactor protection
system circuits will be modified to eliminate the main steam line high radiation scram and main steam line isolation
signals. However, these changes will not affect the remaining scram or vessel isolation functions. In all other respects,
plant design and operation remain unchanged.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Therefore, Niagara Mohawk Power Corporation concludes that the proposed amendment will not create the possibility
of a new or different kind of accident from any previously evaluated.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The operation of Nine Mile Point Unit 1 in accordance with the proposed amendment will not involve a significant reduction
in a margin of safety.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The proposed changes do not involve a significant reduction in a margin of safety because, as shown in the topical report,
the changes represent an overall improvement in plant safety in that the core damage frequency is reduced. Safe operation
of the plant is enhanced by elimination of the unnecessary scram and isolation of the reactor vessel. With implementation
of these changes, the primary heat sink remains available, a large transient on the vessel and safety-related actuations
is avoided, and the Offgas System remains available to control the pathway of a potential release. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Therefore, Niagara Mohawk concludes that the proposed amendment will not involve a significant reduction in a margin
of safety.

Description of amendment request: 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The proposed amendment corrects an editorial error. Specifically, the amendment changes the reference in Limiting
Condition for Operation (LCO) 3.4.D from ``3.3.A through C'' to ``3.4.A, 3.4.B, and 3.4.C.'' The amendment also changes
the associated bases to clarify the LCO minimum solution concentration requirement of 11 weight percent and updates
the excerpt from 10 CFR 50.62 to reflect the current text of the regulation.

Basis for proposed no significant hazards consideration determination: 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
As required by 10 CFR 50.91(a), the licensee has provided its analysis of the issue of no significant hazards consideration,
which is presented below:
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->
In accordance with 10 CFR 50.92, NNECO [Northeast Nuclear Energy Company] has reviewed the proposed change and has
concluded that it does not involve a significant hazards consideration (SHC). The basis for this conclusion is that
the three criteria of 10 CFR 50.92(c) are not compromised. The proposed change does not involve an SHC because the change
would not:
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
1. Involve a significant increase in the probability or consequences of an accident previously evaluated.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The proposed change only modifies an incorrect reference in Section 3.4.D of the Technical Specifications. In practice,
if Specification 3.4.A, 3.4.B, or 3.4.C cannot be met, an orderly shutdown is initiated. As currently written, the
failure to meet the requirements of Section 3.3 would also initiate a shutdown in accordance with Section 3.4.D. This
is not the intent of Section 3.4.D since Section 3.3 already has specific shutdown requirements. This proposed change
will correct Section 3.4.D so that it limits the conditions under which a plant shutdown must be initiated to the LCOs
of the standby liquid control system. Therefore, this proposed change will not increase the probability or consequences
of an accident.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
2. Create the possibility of a new or different kind of accident from any previously evaluated.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The proposed change corrects an incorrect section reference. There is no change to the operation or design of the plant,
nor is there any change to the operability requirements of either section. The proposed change properly identifies
the conditions under which the plant must be shutdown if an LCO is not met for the standby liquid control system. In practice,
if Specification 3.4.A, 3.4.B, or 3.4.C cannot be met, an orderly shutdown is initiated. Since there is no change in
plant operation or design, there is no possibility of a different kind of accident. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
3. Involve a significant reduction in a margin of safety.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The proposed change does not modify the design or function of the plant, nor does it reduce operability requirements
of either Section 3.3 or 3.4. The proposed change only corrects an incorrect section reference by identifying the
correct shutdown requirements for the standby liquid control system. Since there is no change to plant operation
or design and the shutdown requirements are not reduced, there is no reduction in the margin of safety.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
2. Remove the requirement to provide a copy of Plant Operations Review Committee (PORC) and Site Operations Review

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
1. Involve a significant increase in the probability or consequences of an accident previously evaluated.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
No design basis accidents are affected by these proposed changes. The proposed changes are administrative and editorial
in nature to reflect a recent reorganization, removal of the Executive Vice President - Nuclear from receipt of PORC
and SORC meeting minutes, addition of the Senior Vice President - Millstone Station to the receipt of PORC and SORC
meeting minutes, and editorial changes to the Millstone Unit Nos. 1 and 3 Technical Specifications. No safety systems
are adversely affected by the proposed changes, and no failure modes are associated with the changes. Therefore,
there is no impact on the probability of occurrence or the consequences of any design basis events.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
2. Create the possibility of a new or different kind of accident from any previously evaluated.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Since there are no changes in the way the plant is operated, the potential for an unanalyzed accident is not created.
There is no impact on plant response, and no new failure modes are introduced. These proposed administrative and editorial
changes have no impact on safety limits or design basis accidents, and they have no potential to create a new or unanalyzed
event.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
3. Involve a significant reduction in a margin of safety.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The changes do not directly affect any protective boundaries nor do they impact the safety limits for the protective
boundaries. These proposed changes are administrative and editorial in nature. Therefore, there can be no reduction
in the margin of safety.

Description of amendment request: 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The proposed amendment would revise the Technical Specifications to allow a relaxation in setpoint tolerance of
the pressurizer safety valves (PSVs) and main steam safety valves (MSSVs) from plus or minus 1% to plus or minus 3% for
the ``as-found'' test condition.

Basis for proposed no significant hazards consideration determination:

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
As required by 10 CFR 50.91(a), the licensee has provided its analysis of the issue of no significant hazards consideration
(SHC), which is presented below:
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->
The proposed changes do not involve an SHC because the changes would not:
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
1. Involve a significant increase in the probability or consequences of an accident previously evaluated.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The proposed changes revise the ``as found'' setpoint tolerances for the PSVs and MSSVs from [plus or minus] 1% to [plus
or minus] 3%. For the resetting of the PSVs and MSSVs, a [plus or minus] 1% setpoint tolerance will be required prior
to declaring the valve operable for those instances where the [plus or minus] 1% tolerance was exceeded. The proposed
changes involve no hardware modifications to plant structures, systems, or components. The proposed setpoint tolerance
of [plus or minus] 3% for the ``as-found'' condition was previously evaluated as part of the PSE [Plant Safety Evaluation]
report for the transition to VANTAGE 5H fuel. The PSE was reviewed and approved by the NRC staff as a part of a prior license
amendment.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=5 f=1 -->
(9)
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->
 In addition, since the proposed changes have previously been evaluated by the PSE report, the calculated radiological
release associated with the PSE remain unaffected. In addition, the proposed changes are in compliance with applicable
sections of the ASME Code and will not significantly affect structural integrity of either the reactor coolant system
or the main steam system. Therefore, the proposed changes will have no effect on the probability or consequences of
previously evaluated accidents.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
2. Create the possibility of a new or different kind of accident from any accident previously evaluated.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The proposed changes will not create the possibility of a new or different kind of accident from those previously analyzed.
The changes revise the Technical Specifications so that setpoint tolerance for the PSVs and MSSVs can be [plus or minus]
3% for the ``as-found'' condition. These changes have no effect on plant operation. The PSV and MSSV setpoint drift
in excess of the [plus or minus] 1% lift setting is an occurrence which has previously and may subsequently occur. The
analyses for the transition to the VANTAGE 5H fuel have examined the effects on the plant accident analyses for relaxation
in PSV and MSSV setpoint tolerance to [plus or minus] 3%. Also, these changes will have no effect on ASME Code compliance.
These changes do not introduce any new failures.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
3. Involve a significant reduction in the margin of safety.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In support of the transition to the VANTAGE 5H fuel, a PSE was performed which assumed a [plus or minus] 3% setpoint tolerance
for both the PSVs and MSSVs. Therefore, the effects of relaxing the PSV and MSSV setpoints are already accounted for
in the existing analyses of record and will not affect the plants accident analyses. Additionally, the proposed changes
will have no significant effect on the structural integrity of the reactor coolant system or the main steam system.
Also, for those occurrences where the ``as-found'' setpoint of the PSV or MSSV is in excess of [plus or minus] 1%, a resetting
to within [plus or minus] 1% of the valve setpoint will be required prior to declaring the valve operable. Therefore,
the proposed changes will not involve a significant reduction in a margin of safety.

 T3Description of amendment requests: The proposed amendment would revise the combined Technical Specifications
(TS) for the Diablo Canyon Power Plant (DCPP) Unit Nos. 1 and 2 to revise Technical Specification (TS) 3/4.8.1, ``A.C.
Sources'' to increase the required quantity of emergency diesel generator (EDG) fuel oil stored in the engine-mounted
tank (day tank). The amendment request also proposes to revise TS 3/4.7.11, ``Area Temperature Monitoring,'' and
3/4.8.1 to remove references to a five EDG configuration. The specific TS changes proposed are as follows:
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(1) TS 3/4.7.11 would be revised to remove references to a common (swing) diesel generator in Table 3.7-5.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(2) TS 3.8.1.1 and TS 3.8.1.2 would be revised to increase the required minimum contained volume in the EDG engine-mounted
fuel tank (day tank) from 200 gallons to 250 gallons.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(3) TS 3.8.1.1 and TS 4.8.1.1.2 would be revised to remove references to a five EDG configuration.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(4) TS 3.8.1.2 would be revised to correct a footnote. TS Bases 3/4.8.1, 3/4.8.2, and 3/4.8.3 would be revised to clarify
commitments to Regulatory Guide 1.137 and expand the scope of information contained within the TS Bases.

Basis for proposed no significant hazards consideration determination: 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

As required by 10 CFR 50.91(a), the licensee has provided its analysis of the issue of no significant hazards consideration,
which is presented below:
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->
1. Does the change involve a significant increase in the probability or consequences of an accident previously evaluated?
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The proposed increase in day tank TS minimum contained volume requirements provides additional conservatism to
assure the EDG fuel oil contained in the day tank is sufficient to provide adequate time for an operator to take corrective
action to restore the fuel oil supply to the affected day tank in the unlikely event that the fuel oil supply from the
main tanks were cut off.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Deletion of TS references to a five diesel generator configuration and correction of the TS 3.8.1.2 footnote are administrative
changes that do not change the operating methodology of DCPP. These proposed administrative changes remove outdated
information and correct an administrative oversight. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Therefore, the proposed changes do not involve a significant increase in the probability or consequences of an accident
previously evaluated.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
2. Does the change create the possibility of a new or different kind of accident from any accident previously evaluated?
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The proposed increase in day tank TS minimum contained volume requirements would not involve any physical change
to the plant systems or, in particular, to the EDG day tanks. The change does not affect the ability of the EDGs to start
and to fulfill their safety-related function. Hence, no new failure mechanisms will be introduced.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The proposed removal of references to a five EDG configuration and correction of the TS 3.8.1.2 footnote are administrative
in nature. Further, the proposed changes would not result in any physical alteration to any plant system. Therefore,
the proposed changes do not create the possibility of a new or different kind of accident from any accident previously
evaluated.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
3. Does the change involve a significant reduction in a margin of safety?
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Increasing the day tank TS minimum contained volume requirements is a conservative change which provides additional
margin to assure the EDG fuel oil contained in the day tank is sufficient to provide adequate time for an operator to
take corrective action to restore the fuel oil supply to the affected day tank in the unlikely event that the fuel oil
supply from the main tanks were cut off. The proposed change will not alter any accident analysis assumptions, initial
conditions, or results. Consequently, the proposed change to increase the EDG day tank TS contained fuel oil requirement
does not have any effect on the margin of safety.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The proposed administrative changes clarify the TS by removing references to a five diesel generator configuration
and correcting the TS 3.8.1.2 footnote.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Therefore, the proposed change does not involve a significant reduction in a margin of safety.

1) The proposed Operation License (OL) changes do not involve a significant increase in the probability or consequences

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The proposed power rerate imposes only minor increases in the plant operating conditions. Plant systems, components,
and structures have been verified to be capable of performing their intended functions under rerated conditions.
Where necessary, some components will be modified or replaced prior to implementation of the Power Rerate Program
to accommodate the revised operating condition. No new component or system interactions that could lead to an accident
are created. As discussed below, no transient events result in a new sequence of events which could lead to a new accident
scenario. Emergency Core Cooling Systems (ECCS) - Loss-of-Coolant Accident (LOCA) Analysis.

&cir;F, which is below the 2,200
<!-- PJG 0017 degreeslatlong -->
&cir;F regulatory limit. Therefore, the analysis demonstrates that the LGS, Units 1 and 2 will continue to comply
with 10CFR50.46 and 10CFR50, Appendix K.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Transient Event Analysis
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The evaluation results for transient events indicate the margin to the fuel Safety Limit Minimum Critical Power ratio
(MCPR) will be maintained for the 8x8 array fuel types, such as GE8x8NB or GE11 fuel design. The current fuel thermal-mechanical
limits will continue to be met.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Also, the power-dependent and flow-dependent MCPR and Maximum Average Planar Linear Heat Generation Rate (MAPLHGR)
limits developed as part of the Average Power Range Monitor Rod Block Monitor Technical Specifications (ARTS) improvement
program are applicable to power rerate. A TS Change Request to implement the ARTS improvement program was submitted
to the NRC by letter dated August 27, 1993. The peak reactor vessel bottom head pressure will remain within the American
Society for Mechanical Engineers (ASME) Code requirement for reactor overpressure protection.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The analysis performed focused on the most limiting transient events in each disturbance category selected specifically
for the power rerate evaluations. The results demonstrated that LGS, Unit 1 and Unit 2 core thermal power output can
be safely increased to power rerate parameters without impacting plant safety during a postulated transient event.
The details of the impact to the description in the UFSAR are delineated below. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
a) Events Resulting in a Core Coolant Temperature Decrease
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
i) Loss of Feedwater Heating (LFWH)
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The delta Critical Power Ratio (delta CPR) for the LFWH event at the rerated power is bounded by the result estimated
for the current rated power level and remains significantly less than the Operating Limit MCPR. There is no change
between the delta CPR results for high and low reactor core flow conditions. The calculated thermal and mechanical
overpowers for this event at power rerate conditions also meet the fuel design criteria. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
ii) Feedwater Controller Failure (FWCF) Maximum Demand
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
For the Increased Core Flow (ICF) and the Maximum Extended Load Line Limit (MELLL) conditions, the trend for the FWCF
- Maximum Demand event at rerate conditions is consistent with the current rated power analysis. For both high and
low reactor core flow conditions, the FWCF - Maximum Demand event becomes most limiting due to the Turbine Bypass Valve
Out-of-Service (TBVOOS) and the Recirculation Pump Trip Out-of-Service (RPTOOS) analyses assumption. The fuel
thermal margin results remain within the acceptable limits for the fuel type analyzed. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
b) Events Resulting in a Reactor Pressure Increase
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
i) Turbine Trip with No Bypass (TTNBP)
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
At rerate conditions, the fuel transient thermal and mechanical overpower results remain below the NRC acceptance
criteria. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
ii) Generator Load Rejection with No Bypass (LRNBP)
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The fuel transient thermal responses are less severe than for the TTNBP event described above. Therefore, at power
rerate conditions, the LRNBP event remains bounded by the TTNBP event. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
iii) Main Steam Isolation Valve Closure, Flux Scram (MSIVF)
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The peak reactor vessel bottom head pressure for rerate conditions is slightly higher than the pressure at current
rated conditions due to the higher initial reactor coolant system pressure. However, this result is still below the
ASME overpressure limit of 1,375 psig by a margin of 33 psi.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
c) Events Resulting in a Core Coolant System Flow Rate Decrease 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
i) Recirculation Pump Seizure
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The recirculation pump seizure assumes instantaneous stoppage of the pump motor shaft of one recirculation pump.
As a result, the reactor core flow decreases rapidly. The reactor flow decreases rapidly. The reactor vessel level
swell due to the rapid reactor core flow reduction reaches the high reactor water level setpoint, causing a feedwater
pump trip, a main turbine trip, and subsequently a reactor scram on turbine stop valves closure. The peak neutron flux
and average fuel surface heat flux do not increase significantly above the initial conditions, therefore no impact
on the fuel thermal margin is postulated to occur.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
d) Events Resulting in Reactivity and Power Distribution Anomalies
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
i) Rod Withdrawal Error (RWE)
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The calculated delta CPR of 0.10 for this event at rerate conditions is bounded by the generic ARTS - based RWE limits
of 0.13. Therefore, the generic ARTS-based RWE analysis delta CPR result is verified to be applicable for power rerate
conditions for LGS Units 1 and 2.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
e) Events Resulting in a Reactor Coolant Inventory Increase
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
i) Inadvertent High Pressure Coolant Injection (HPCI) System Actuation
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Based on the peak average fuel surface heat flux results, the HPCI actuation event will be bounded by the limiting pressurization
event (i.e., the TTNBP event described above) for delta CPR consideration.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Anticipated Transients Without SCRAM (ATWS) Analysis
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
A generic evaluation for the ATWS event is provided in Section 3.7 of the Topical Report NEDC-31984P, ``Generic Evaluations
of General Electric Boiling Water Reactor Power Uprate,'' Supplement 1, dated July 1991. This evaluation concludes
that the ATWS acceptance criteria for fuel, reactor pressure vessel (RPV) and containment integrity will be met,
if the following exists;
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
- Reactor power increases less than or equal to 5%
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
- Reactor Steam Dome pressure increases less than or equal to 40 psi;
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
- Safety Relief Valve (SRV) opening setpoints increase less than or equal to 80 psi; and
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
- ATWS high pressure setpoint increases less than or equal to 20 psi. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The plant's parameter changes will remain within the above criteria, except that the ATWS high pressure setpoint
increase is 40 psi rather than 20 psi in order to maintain the same relationship between the ATWS high pressure setpoint
and the SRV opening setpoints. Based on the previous analysis, this difference would have a minor effect on the analysis
results. The only significant change is a slightly higher (i.e., about 10 psi) peak RPV pressure.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
For additional assurance, a LGS specific ATWS analysis for a 5% power rerate was performed. The events analyzed were:
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
1. Main Steam Isolation Valve (MSIV) Closure,
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
2. Pressure Regulator Failure - Open,
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
3. Loss of Feedwater, and
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
4. Inadvertent Opening of a Relief Valve.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The LGS specific analysis also concludes that the ATWS acceptance criteria for fuel, RPV, and containment integrity
will be met for a 5% power rerate.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Other Evaluations
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The impact of power rerate on the radiological consequences of the accidents presented in UFSAR Chapter 15 was determined
based on the current design basis analyses, post rerate implementation system conditions, and radiological source
terms. In general, power rerate will result in a small increase in the quantity of radioactive material released during
accidents and therefore slightly higher (i.e., approximately 2% to 5%) accident doses. However, USFAR Chapter 15
accident doses for rerated conditions remain within the regulatory limits specified in 10CFR100 and 10CFR50, Appendix
A, GDC 19.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The UFSAR Chapter 15 accidents that were evaluated and updated for rerate conditions are as follows:
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
1) Loss of Coolant Accident (LOCA)
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
2) Main Steam Line Break (MSLB)
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
3) Fuel Handling Accident
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
4) Control Rod Drop Accident
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
5) Instrument Line Break
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
6) Feedwater Line Break
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
7) Steam Jet Air Ejector Line Break
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
8) Offgas System Failure
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
9) Liquid Radioactive Waste System Failure
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
An evaluation was also performed to address the power rerate impact on accident mitigative features, structures,
systems, and components, within the balance of plant. The results are as follows:
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
- Auxiliary systems such as the Emergency Service Water, Residual Heat Removal (RHR) Service Water, Ultimate Heat
Sink (i.e., the spray pond), safety-related portions of secondary containment reactor enclosure air cooling, primary
containment drywell air recirculation, and Emergency Diesel Generator enclosure ventilation were confirmed to
operate acceptably under normal and accident conditions after implementation of power rerate.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
- Combustible gas control systems were confirmed to be capable of maintaining oxygen concentrations inside the primary
containment within regulatory limits under post accident rerate conditions.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
- The secondary containment reactor enclosure recirculation system and Standby Gas Treatment system were confirmed
to be able to adequately contain, process, and control the release of normal and post-accident levels of radioactive
material after implementation of power rerate.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
- Instrumentation was reviewed and confirmed to be capable of performing their control and monitoring functions
under rerate conditions.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
- Electric power systems including the main turbine generator and switchgear components were verified as being capable
of providing the electrical load as a result of the rerated power levels. No safety-related electrical loads were
affected which would impact the Emergency Diesel Generators.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
- Piping systems were evaluated for the effect of operation at higher power levels, including transient loadings.
The evaluation confirmed that with few exceptions piping and supports are adequate to accommodate the increased
loadings resulting from operation at rerated power conditions. In a few cases, piping supports will be modified to
accept the higher forces due to rerate conditions.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
- The effect of rerate conditions on high energy line break (HELB) events for all Nuclear Steam Supply System (NSSS)
and Balance of Plant (BOP) systems was evaluated. The evaluation confirmed structures, systems, and components
important to safety are capable of accommodating the effects of jet impingement and blowdown forces and the environmental
effects resulting from HELB events at rerate conditions.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
- The Moderate Energy Line Break (MELB) analysis was evaluated for impact due to rerate conditions. Sufficient margin
was determined to exist in the original analysis to bound the rerate conditions.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
- Main control room (MCR) habitability was evaluated. Post-accident MCR and Technical Support Center (TSC) doses
were confirmed to be within the limits of General Design Criterion (GDC) 19 of 10CFR50 Appendix A.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
- Radiation doses for normal operation were reviewed and confirmed to remain within the limits of 10CFR20 and 10CFR50,
Appendix I. The impact on post-accident sampling activities and post-accident access to vital areas was also confirmed
to be acceptable.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
- The environmental qualification of electrical and mechanical equipment important to safety was evaluated for
the impact of normal and accident operating conditions at rerated power levels. The majority of equipment will remain
qualified for the new conditions. For equipment that is not qualified, corrective actions will be taken to ensure
the plant equipment will perform their intended functions under rerate conditions. No new equipment will be added
for power rerate which would increase the potential for component failure. The Preventative Maintenance Program
(PMP) will continue to provide for appropriate equipment repair or replacement during operation at rerated power
conditions.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
- The impact of operation at rerated power levels was evaluated for Station Blackout and Fire Safety Shutdown area
heat-up concerns. The evaluation confirmed there is no adverse impact from rerate on the ability of the plant to achieve
safe shutdown under these conditions. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
- The consequences of postulated transients and special events (i.e., ATWS and Station Blackout) will remain within
NRC acceptance criteria for rerate conditions. Concurrent malfunctions assumed to occur during accidents have
been accounted for in the safety analyses for rerate conditions. The consequences of these equipment malfunctions
will not change with implementation of the Power Rerate Program. Equipment that is important to safety either is capable
of or will be modified and/or replaced to be capable of performing its intended function. The availability of redundant
systems to provide safety functions in the event of component malfunction is not impacted as a result of rerate conditions.
Furthermore, the impact of power rerate on the consequences of abnormal transients and accident conditions which
are a result of component malfunctions has been shown to be acceptable.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The probability (i.e., frequency of occurrence) of Design Basis Accidents (DBAs) occurring is not affected by the
proposed increased power level, as the applicable regulatory criteria established for plant equipment (e.g., ASME
Code, the Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers (IEEE) standards, National Electrical Manufacturer's
Association (NEMA) standards, NRC Regulatory Guides) will still be followed as the plant is operated at the rerated
power level. Reactor SCRAM setpoints will be established such that there is no significant increase in frequency
due to rerate conditions. No new challenges to safety-related equipment will result from the implementation of power
rerate.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The changes in consequences of hypothetical accidents which would occur from 102% of the rerated power, compared
to those previously evaluated, are in all cases not significant, because the accident evaluations from a power rerate
to 105% of original rated power will not result in exceeding the applicable NRC approved acceptance limits. The spectrum
of hypothetical accidents and transients has been investigated, and has been determined to meet the current regulatory
criteria for LGS, Units 1 and 2 at rerate conditions. The offsite radiological doses resulting from DBAs are calculated
to increase by only a few percent (i.e., approximately 2% to 5%) because of the rerated power level, and will remain
below 10CFR100 limits. In the area of reactor core design, the fuel operating limits will continue to be met at the rerated
power level, and fuel reload analyses will continue to show that plant transients will meet the criteria accepted
by the NRC as specified in NEDO-24011, ``GESTAR II.''
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Challenges to fuel or ECCS performance were evaluated and shown to still meet the criteria of 10CFR50.46 and 10CFR50,
Appendix K. Challenges to the primary containment have been evaluated and still meet 10CFR50, Appendix A, GDC 38,
``Long Term Cooling,'' and GDC 50, ``Containment.'' Radiological release events have been evaluated and have been
shown to meet the guidelines of 10CFR100.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Therefore, the proposed OL changes do not involve a significant increase in the probability or consequences of an
accident previously evaluated.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
2) The proposed OL changes do not create the possibility of a new or different kind of accident from any accident previously
evaluated.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
All actions to ensure that safety-related structures, systems, and components will remain within their design allowable
values, and ensure that they can perform their intended functions under rerate conditions will be taken prior to implementation
of power rerate. Power rerate does not increase challenges to or create any new challenges to safety-related equipment
or other equipment whose failure could cause an accident. No new equipment is added as a result of implementing the
Power Rerate Program which would create the possibility of a new type of accident. In addition, power rerate does not
create any new sequence of events or failure modes that lead to a new type of accident. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Implementation of power rerate will increase the average neutron flux in the reactor core, which increases the integrated
neutron fluence on the reactor pressure vessel (RPV) wall. To account for the higher fluence, an RPV fracture toughness
analysis was performed for power rerate conditions. This analysis resulted in a proposed revision to the ``pressure
vs. temperature'' curves currently provided in the Technical Specifications (TS), that will maintain the current
level of protection for the RPV. Therefore, power rerate will not result in any new failure mode for the RPV, and thus,
does not create the possibility of a different type of accident from any accident previously evaluated. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
No new operating mode, safety-related equipment lineup, accident scenario, or equipment failure mode was identified
as resulting from the implementation of the Power Rerate Program. The full spectrum of accident considerations defined
in NRC Regulatory Guide 1.70, ``Standard Format and Content of Safety Analysis Reports for Nuclear Power Plants -
LWR Edition,'' Revision 3, dated November 1978, have been evaluated for rerate conditions and no new or different
kind of accident has been identified. Implementation of the Power Rerate Program uses already-developed technology
and applies it within the capabilities of already existing plant equipment in accordance with presently existing
regulatory criteria to include applicable NRC approved codes, standards, and methods. General Electric (GE) has
designed Boiling Water Reactors (BWRs) of higher power levels than the rerated power of any of the currently operating
BWR fleet and no new power dependent accidents have been identified.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Therefore, the proposed OL changes do not create the possibility of a new or different kind of accident from any accident
previously evaluated.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
3) The proposed OL changes do not involve a significant reduction in a margin of safety.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Power rerate will not involve a significant reduction in a margin of safety, as plant equipment and reactions to transients
and hypothetical accidents will not result in exceeding the presently approved NRC acceptance limits. The accident
doses are calculated to increase a few percent (approximately 2% to 5%) because of power rerate, but remain below 10
CFR 100 limits. The events (i.e., transients, accidents, and ATWS) that form the bases of the TS were evaluated for
power rerate conditions. Although some changes to the TS are required to implement power rerate, no NRC acceptance
limit will be exceeded. Therefore, the margins of safety with respect to the safety limits and other TS bases will be
maintained. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
For systems addressed in the TS Section 2.2, 3/4.1, 3/4.2, 3/4.3, 3/4.4, 3/4.5, 3/4.6 and 3/4.7 (i.e., Reactor Protection
System, Standby Liquid Control System, Power Distribution Limits, Instrumentation, Reactor Coolant System, Emergency
Core Cooling Systems, Containment Systems, and Plant Systems), all components will be operable and capable of performing
their intended functions under power rerate conditions such that the margin of safety is not adversely impacted.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Therefore, the proposed OL changes do not involve a significant reduction in a margin of safety.

The proposed Technical Specification (TS) changes revise Table 3.2.F, ``Surveillance Instrumentation,'' to accurately

Basis for proposed no significant hazards consideration determination: 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
As required by 10 CFR 50.91(a), the licensee has provided its analysis of the issue of no significant hazards consideration,
which is presented below:
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->
1. The proposed change does not involve a significant increase in the probability or consequences of an accident previously
evaluated.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Because the proposed changes are administrative in nature, they do not affect the initial conditions or precursors
assumed in the Updated Final Safety Analysis Report Section 14. These changes do not decrease the effectiveness of
equipment relied upon to mitigate the previously evaluated accidents. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Therefore, there is no increase in the probability or consequences of an accident previously evaluated. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
2. The proposed change does not create the possibility of a new or different kind of accident from any previously evaluated.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The proposed changes do not make any physical changes to the plant or changes to operating procedures. Therefore,
implementation of the proposed changes will not affect the design function or configuration of any component or introduce
any new operating scenarios or failure modes or accident initiation.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Therefore, the proposed changes do not create the possibility of a new or different kind of accident from any previously
evaluated.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
3. The proposed change does not involve a significant reduction in a margin of safety. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The proposed changes are administrative in nature and are intended to provide clarification or eliminate confusion
when interpreting the Technical Specifications. The proposed changes do not adversely affect the assumptions or
sequence of events used in any accident analysis.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Therefore, the proposed changes do not involve a reduction in any margin of safety.

The licensee is preparing to replace the currently installed steam generators with new model Delta 75 steam generators
(Delta 75 SGs). The new steam generators will be larger than those currently installed. The physical changes to the
plant and the accident reanalyses needed to support those changes will necessitate changes to the Technical Specifications
(TS). The TS changes requested involve alterations to the core operating limits, changes to various reactor trip
setpoints, deletion of the negative flux rate trip, removal of references to specific analyses, changes to the steam/feedwater
flow mismatch activation setpoint, changes to shutdown limits, changes to instrument uncertainty allowances,
a change to the methodology for reactor coolant system (RCS) flow determination, modifications to departure from
nucleate boiling (DNB) parameters, a change to the engineered safety features actuation system setpoints for steam
generator water levels, removal of the F* and L* criteria, and the addition of a requirement for a first inservice inspection
for the new steam generators. Due to the size of the new steam generators, TS containing references to the maximum containment
pressure following a steam line break and the total RCS volume will also change; in addition, a reference to RCS temperature
is changed from a nominal value to an indicated value.

Basis for proposed no significant hazards consideration determination: 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
As required by 10 CFR 50.91(a), South Carolina Electric &amp; Gas Company (SCE&amp;G or the licensee) has provided
its analysis of the issue of no significant hazards consideration, which is presented below:
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->
1) Operation of VCSNS [Virgil C. Summer Nuclear Station] in accordance with the proposed license amendment does not
involve a significant increase in the probability or consequences of an accident previously evaluated.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Implementation of the [Delta] 75 SGs and revised operating conditions do not contribute to the initiation of any accident
evaluated in the FSAR [Final Safety Analysis Report]. Supporting factors are as follows: 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
- The [Delta] 75 SG is designed in accordance with ASME [American Society of Mechanical Engineers] Code Section III,
1986 edition [sic] and other applicable federal, state, and local laws, codes and regulations and meets the original
interfaces for the Model D3 SGs with exception that provisions for a larger blowdown nozzle have been made and the feedwater
inlet nozzle is located in the upper shell. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
- All NSSS [nuclear steam supply system] components (i.e., reactor vessel, RC Pumps, pressurizer, CRDM's [control
rod drive mechanisms], [Delta] 75 SGs, and RCS piping) are compatible with the revised operating conditions. Their
structural integrity is maintained during all proposed plant conditions through compliance with the ASME code.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
- Fluid and auxiliary systems which are important to safety are not adversely impacted and will continue to perform
their design function. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
- Overall plant performance and operation are not significantly altered by the proposed changes. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Therefore, since the reactor coolant pressure boundary integrity and system functions are not adversely impacted,
the probability of occurrence of an accident evaluated in the VCSNS FSAR will be no greater than the original design
basis of the plant. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
An extensive analysis has been performed to evaluate the consequences of the following accident types currently
evaluated in the VCSNS FSAR: 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
- Non-LOCA [loss-of-coolant accident]
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
- Large Break LOCA 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
- Steam Generator Tube Rupture
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
With the [Delta] 75 SGs and revised operating conditions, the calculated results (i.e., DNBR [departure from nucleate
boiling ratio], Primary and Secondary System Pressure, Peak Clad Temperature, Metal Water Reaction, Challenge
to Long Term Cooling, Environmental Conditions Inside and Outside Containment, etc.) for the accidents are similar
to those currently reported in the VCSNS FSAR. Select results (i.e., Containment Pressure During a Steam Line Break,
Minimum DNBR for Rod Withdrawal from Subcritical, etc.) are slightly more limiting than those reported in the current
FSAR due to the use of the assumed operating conditions with the new [Delta] 75 SGs, and in some cases, use of an uprated
core power of 2900 MWt. However, in all cases, the calculated results do not challenge the integrity of the primary/secondary/
containment pressure boundary and remain within the regulatory acceptance criteria applied to VCSNS's current
licensing basis. The assumptions utilized in the radiological evaluations, described in Section 3.7, are thus appropriate
and are judged to provide a conservative estimate of the radiological consequences during accident conditions.
Given that calculated radiological consequences are not significantly higher than current FSAR results and remain
well within 10CFR100 limits, it is concluded that the consequences of an accident previously evaluated in the FSAR
are not increased. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
2) The proposed license amendment does not create the possibility of a new or different kind of accident from any accident
previously evaluated. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The [Delta] 75 SGs and revised operating conditions will not introduce any new accident initiator mechanisms. Structural
integrity of the RCS is maintained during all plant conditions through compliance with the ASME code. No new failure
modes or limiting single failures have been identified. Design requirements of auxiliary systems are met with the
RSGs [Replacement Steam Generators]. Since the safety and design requirements continue to be met and the integrity
of the reactor coolant system pressure boundary is not challenged, no new accident scenarios have been created. Therefore,
the types of accidents defined in the FSAR continue to represent the credible spectrum of events to be analyzed which
determine safe plant operation. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
3) The proposed license amendment does not involve a significant reduction in a margin of safety. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Although the [Delta] 75 SGs and revised operating conditions will require changes to the VCSNS Technical Specifications,
it will not invalidate the LOCA, non-LOCA, or SGTR [steam generator tube rupture] conclusions presented in the FSAR
accident analyses (Appendix 6). For all the FSAR non-LOCA transients, the DNB design basis, primary and secondary
pressure limits, and dose limits continue to be met. The LOCA peak cladding temperatures remain below the limits specified
in 10CFR50.46. The calculated doses resulting from a SGTR event will continue to remain within a small fraction of
the 10CFR100 permissible releases. Environmental conditions associated with High Energy Line Break (HELB) both
inside and outside containment have been evaluated. The containment design pressure will not be violated as a result
of the HELB. Equipment qualification will be updated, as necessary, to reflect the revised conditions resulting
from HELB. The margin of safety with respect to primary pressure boundary is provided, in part, by the safety factors
included in the ASME Code. Since the components remain in compliance with the codes and standards in effect when VCSNS
was originally licensed (with the exception of the [Delta] 75 RSGs which use the 1986 ASME Code Section III Edition),
the margin of safety is not reduced. Thus, there is no reduction in the margin to safety as defined in the bases of the
VCSNS Technical Specifications.

Description of amendment request: 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The proposed changes would revise Technical Specification 3/4.3.3.6, ``Accident Monitoring Instrumentation,''
and the associated Technical Specification Bases. The changes are in accordance with the applicable guidance of
Revision 3 to Regulatory Guide (RG) 1.97.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Basis for proposed no significant hazards consideration determination: 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
As required by 10 CFR 50.91(a), the licensee has provided its analysis of the issue of no significant hazards consideration,
which is presented below. The proposed changes would not:
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->
(1) Involve a significant increase in the probability or consequences of an accident previously evaluated. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Regulatory Guide 1.97 furnishes standards acceptable to the NRC for instrumentation to monitor plant variables
and systems during and following an accident. The purpose of the accident monitoring instrumentation is to display
plant variables that provide information required by the control room operators for manual actions and long term
recovery. Determination of variable types and category designations for VCSNS [Virgil C. Summer Nuclear Station]
was accomplished from a review of the Emergency Response Guidelines (ERGs), the Final Safety Analysis Report, and
the Westinghouse Owners Group (WOG) ERGs. The WOG ERGs were used at VCSNS as a basis for the Emergency Response Procedures.
Operability of the instruments used for accident monitoring ensures there is sufficient information available
on selected plant parameters to monitor plant status during and following an accident. The changes proposed do not
effect components that can cause an accident. The increase in allowable outage times from 7 to 30 days or from 48 hours
to 7 days does not significantly affect the consequences of an event previously evaluated. The channel redundancy
and the relatively short outage times, coupled with the low probability of an event requiring accident monitoring
instrumentation during this interval, ensure that sufficient information is available for operator manual actions.
The condition of the plant in either HOT STANDBY or HOT SHUTDOWN, the first stage of the plant shutdown process, has
no impact on the assumptions made in the accident analysis. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The change in mode applicability for the Reactor Building Area High Range Radiation Monitors to include modes 1, 2,
and 3, but exclude mode 4, is based on the usage of these monitors which is to indicate a significant degradation of the
reactor coolant pressure boundary. These monitors do not initiate any automatic mitigation system and are solely
required to be operable to provide indication which in conjunction with other operator actions will aid in mitigating
the consequences of design basis accidents. Design basis accident sequences which may create a significant degradation
of the reactor coolant pressure boundary are not postulated to occur during mode 4. Therefore, the proposed change
does not increase the probability or consequences of any accident previously evaluated. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(2) Create the possibility of a new or different kind of accident from any previously evaluated. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The proposed change is consistent with the requirements of RG 1.97. The accident monitoring instrumentation will
make available reliable information to plant control room operators to mitigate the consequences of a design basis
accident. The first stages of plant shutdown, HOT STANDBY and HOT SHUTDOWN, are plant modes for which VCSNS has been
analyzed. Since no plant configuration changes or changes to the mode of operation of equipment, systems, and components
are introduced by the proposed Technical Specification, no new failure modes or accident sequences are instituted.
Therefore, the changes proposed do not create the possibility of a new or different kind of accident from any previously
analyzed. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(3) Involve a significant reduction in a margin of safety.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The inclusion of category 1, type A or B, instrumentation in the TS [Technical Specifications] provides assurance
that adequate information is available to the operators to maintain VCSNS in a safe condition during and following
a design basis accident. Accomplishment of specific manual action by the control room operators is enhanced due to
the availability and reliability of the indications. The proposed changes do not affect the design or operation of
safety related components relied upon to automatically mitigate the consequences of a design basis event. The proposed
change from HOT SHUTDOWN to HOT STANDBY as the first stage of plant shutdown will not affect the design or operation
of any safety related system or component. Therefore, the changes proposed would not involve a reduction in any margin
of safety.

Basis for proposed no significant hazards consideration determination: 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
As required by 10 CFR 50.91(a), the licensee has provided its analysis of the issue of no significant hazards consideration,
which is presented below:
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->
1. Will operation of the facility in accordance with this proposed change involve a significant increase in the probability
or consequences of an accident previously evaluated?
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Response: No
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The proposed change provides new actions and Allowed Outage Times (AOTs) for valves in Section D of Technical Specification
(TS) Table 3.6-1 that are currently allowed by the existing TS to be secured for an indefinite period of time as long
as they are secured in their Engineered Safety Feature Actuation System (ESFAS) actuated position. These valves
are considered operable by the existing TS although they may be unable to perform their containment isolation function.
The proposed change ensures that these valves are returned to operable status within specified times based on the
results of specific risk evaluations on their contribution to core damage or offsite dose release. The proposed change
does not involve a physical change to the facility as described in the Updated Final Safety Analysis Report (UFSAR).
Therefore, this proposed change does not involve a significant increase in the probability or consequences of an
accident previously evaluated.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
2. Will operation of the facility in accordance with this proposed change create the possibility of a new or different
kind of accident from any accident previously evaluated?
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Response: No
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The ESFAS actuated positions of these valves are the positions assumed in the safety analysis. There are no new accidents
associated with this proposed change because the previously analyzed events already considered failures of containment
isolation valves. The plant is equipped with dual and redundant containment isolation valves. Leaving the valves
in their ESFAS actuated positions does not create a new accident. Therefore, this proposed change does not create
the possibility of a new or different kind of accident from any accident previously evaluated.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
3. Will operation of the facility in accordance with this proposed change involve a significant reduction in a margin
of safety?
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Response: No
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
This proposed change 1) limits the AOT of certain valves based on contributions to core damage and offsite dose release
when the valves are secured in their ESFAS actuated position and 2) requires these valves to be returned to OPERABLE
status prior to Mode 4 entry from a cold shutdown to ensure they are available to perform their intended containment
isolation function. Previously, these valves could be secured in the ESFAS actuated position indefinitely. Therefore,
this proposed change does not involve a significant reduction in a margin of safety.

Description of amendment request:

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The proposed change would revise the Technical Specifications (TS) for the North Anna Power Station, Units No. 1 and
No. 2 (NA-1&amp;2). The proposed changes revise the review responsibilities of the Station Nuclear Safety and Operating
Committee (SNSOC) and the Management Safety Review Committee (MSRC).
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The NA-1&amp;2 TS address the organization and responsibilities of both the onsite and offsite review groups: SNSOC
and MSRC, respectively. The responsibilities of the SNSOC include the review of new procedures and changes to procedures
that affect nuclear safety. The MSRC review responsibilities include the review of safety evaluations and SNSOC
meeting minutes and reports. The extent of these review activities would be revised by the proposed changes to ensure
the two review groups are focusing on nuclear safety issues and not spending an unnecessary amount of time on activities
of minimal safety significance. Specifically, the proposed changes would revise the review responsibilities of
SNSOC regarding procedure changes. Rather than reviewing all procedure changes, SNSOC would only review procedure
changes that require a safety evaluation. The proposed changes also would revise the review responsibilities of
the MSRC. Rather than reviewing all of the safety evaluations and SNSOC meeting minutes and reports as presently required
by the TS, the MSRC would only review a representative sample of these documents.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->
[T]he elimination of the SNSOC review of procedure changes that do not require a safety evaluation, revising the wording
for approval of procedure changes, and the modification of the MSRC's duties regarding their review of safety evaluations
and SNSOC meeting minutes and reports will not:
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
1. Involve a significant increase in the probability or consequences of an accident previously evaluated. As administrative
changes, the proposed Technical Specifications changes have no direct or indirect effect on accident precursors.
No plant modifications are being implemented and operation of the plant is unchanged. SNSOC review of new procedures
and procedure changes that require a safety evaluation ensures that activities that could affect nuclear safety
are being properly reviewed. The MSRC's overview of representative samples of safety evaluations and SNSOC meeting
minutes and reports based on performance ensures these programs are being properly implemented and nuclear safety
is not being compromised; or
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
2. Create the possibility of a new or different kind of accident from any accident previously evaluated since physical
modifications are not involved and systems and components will be operated as before the change. The proposed changes
are wholly administrative in nature and have no impact on plant operations or accident considerations. These changes
modify the scope of SNSOC review of procedure changes and MSRC's review functions concerning safety evaluations
and SNSOC meeting minutes and reports. Procedure changes will continue to receive management review in accordance
with administative procedures, however, only changes that require a safety evaluation will require SNSOC approval.
MSRC review of representative samples of safety evaluations and SNSOC meeting minutes and reports based on performance
will continue to provide adequate assurance that nuclear safety is being properly considered; or
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
3. Involve a significant reduction in a margin of safety as defined in the basis of any Technical Specification since
the responsibilities of the SNSOC and MSRC are not addressed by the existing Technical Specification Bases, nor are
review requirements for procedures. The proposed changes are administrative in nature and have no impact on, nor
were they considered in, existing UFSAR accident analyses. Safety significant procedure changes, i.e., changes
that require a safety evaluation to be prepared, will continue to be reviewed by SNSOC, as will new procedures. Procedure
changes still require cognizant management approval and preparation of an activity screening to determine whether
or not the change impacts nuclear safety. This ensures activities important to nuclear safety are being appropriately
reviewed. The effectiveness of the safety evaluation program, and the thoroughness of SNSOC meetings and reports
will be assured through the MSRC's plant overview function which is based on observed performance.

The proposed amendments would provide an interim acceptance criteria for control rod drop time on Oconee Unit 1. Specifically,
control rod Group 1, Rod 8, and Group 2, Rod 5, would be considered operable with an insertion time of less than or equal
to 3.00 seconds provided that: (1) the average insertion time for the remaining rods in Group 1 and the average insertion
time for the remaining rods in Group 2 is less than or equal to 1.5 seconds, and (2) the core average negative reactivity
insertion rate is within the assumptions of the safety analysis. The acceptance criteria would apply until the end
of the current fuel cycle for Oconee Unit 1. This acceptance criteria for rod drop time would apply for the two rods,
rather than the existing Technical Specification 4.7.1 limit of 2.00 seconds from the fully withdrawn position to
3/4 insertion.

#I11#T3Brief description of amendment request: The proposed amendment would grant one-time extensions for certain
Technical Specification surveillances which are currently required to be performed beginning February 16, 1994.
The licensee is requesting extension of the surveillance intervals because the current operating cycle has been
extended, impacting the required completion dates for these surveillances. Performance of these surveillances
within the required intervals would require that the plant be placed in an undesirable operating configuration,
or would necessitate a plant shutdown. The surveillances for which extensions have been requested will be performed
during the fifth refueling outage, scheduled to begin on April 16, 1994.

The proposed amendment would add Limiting Conditions for Operation (LCO) and Surveillance Requirements to Tables
3.12.1, ``Water Spray/Sprinkler Protected Areas,'' and 4.12.1, ``Water Spray/Sprinkler Tests,'' and clarify
the associated Bases to reflect the installation of a new full area fire suppression system in the east and west cable
tunnels. This new full area fire suppression system was installed because the previous sprinkler system did not provide
coverage to some cable trays and the sprinkler head orientation did not provide full coverage of the cable trays where
it was installed. The proposed amendment would also correct other portions of Tables 3.12.1 and 4.12.1 for consistency
with changes made to reflect the east and west cable tunnel modification.

be revised to change the second level undervoltage trip setpoint and allowable values. Technical Specification
3/4.8.1, ``A.C. Sources,'' would also be changed to revise the diesel generator (DG) steady state voltage surveillance
requirements. The second level undervoltage relay TS setpoint and allowable values will be changed to maintain acceptable
voltages at the 480 volt and 120 volt buses during sustained degraded voltage conditions. The DG steady state voltage
surveillance requirements will be changed to ensure that the diesel generators provide adequate voltage when required
to power the vital loads.

Brief description of amendment: 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The amendment allows a one-time TS change to extend the allowed outage time (AOTs) for the Unit 2 residual heat removal
service water (RHRSW) system as well as the suppression pool spray and suppression pool cooling modes of the residual
heat removal system from 72, 168 (i.e. seven days), and 72 hours, respectively, to 288 hours (i.e., twelve days). The
extended AOTs would allow continued Unit 2 operation while maintenance isolation valves are installed on both loops
of the RHRSW system.

Notice Of Issuance Of Amendments To Facility Operating Licenses And Final Determination Of No Significant Hazards
Consideration And Opportunity For A Hearing (Exigent Public Announcement Or Emergency Circumstances)
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
During the period since publication of the last biweekly notice, the Commission has issued the following amendments.
The Commission has determined for each of these amendments that the application for the amendment complies with the
standards and requirements of the Atomic Energy Act of 1954, as amended (the Act), and the Commission's rules and regulations.
The Commission has made appropriate findings as required by the Act and the Commission's rules and regulations in
10 CFR Chapter I, which are set forth in the license amendment. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Because of exigent or emergency circumstances associated with the date the amendment was needed, there was not time
for the Commission to publish, for public comment before issuance, its usual 30-day Notice of Consideration of Issuance
of Amendment, Proposed No Significant Hazards Consideration Determination, and Opportunity for a Hearing. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
For exigent circumstances, the Commission has either issued a 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 -->
Federal Register 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
notice providing opportunity for public comment or has used local media to provide notice to the public in the area
surrounding a licensee's facility of the licensee's application and of the Commission's proposed determination
of no significant hazards consideration. The Commission has provided a reasonable opportunity for the public to
comment, using its best efforts to make available to the public means of communication for the public to respond quickly,
and in the case of telephone comments, the comments have been recorded or transcribed as appropriate and the licensee
has been informed of the public comments.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In circumstances where failure to act in a timely way would have resulted, for example, in derating or shutdown of a
nuclear power plant or in prevention of either resumption of operation or of increase in power output up to the plant's
licensed power level, the Commission may not have had an opportunity to provide for public comment on its no significant
hazards consideration determination. In such case, the license amendment has been issued without opportunity for
comment. If there has been some time for public comment but less than 30 days, the Commission may provide an opportunity
for public comment. If comments have been requested, it is so stated. In either event, the State has been consulted
by telephone whenever possible.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Under its regulations, the Commission may issue and make an amendment immediately effective, notwithstanding the
pendency before it of a request for a hearing from any person, in advance of the holding and completion of any required
hearing, where it has determined that no significant hazards consideration is involved. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Commission has applied the standards of 10 CFR 50.92 and has made a final determination that the amendment involves
no significant hazards consideration. The basis for this determination is contained in the documents related to
this action. Accordingly, the amendments have been issued and made effective as indicated. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Unless otherwise indicated, the Commission has determined that these amendments satisfy the criteria for categorical
exclusion in accordance with 10 CFR 51.22. Therefore, pursuant to 10 CFR 51.22(b), no environmental impact statement
or environmental assessment need be prepared for these amendments. If the Commission has prepared an environmental
assessment under the special circumstances provision in 10 CFR 51.12(b) and has made a determination based on that
assessment, it is so indicated.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
For further details with respect to the action see (1) the application for amendment, (2) the amendment to Facility
Operating License, and (3) the Commission's related letter, Safety Evaluation and/or Environmental Assessment,
as indicated. All of these items are available for public inspection at the Commission's Public Document Room, the
Gelman Building, 2120 L Street, NW., Washington, DC 20555, and at the local public document room for the particular
facility involved. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Commission is also offering an opportunity for a hearing with respect to the issuance of the amendment. By March
18, 1994, the licensee may file a request for a hearing with respect to issuance of the amendment to the subject facility
operating license and any person whose interest may be affected by this proceeding and who wishes to participate as
a party in the proceeding must file a written request for a hearing and a petition for leave to intervene. Requests for
a hearing and a petition for leave to intervene shall be filed in accordance with the Commission's ``Rules of Practice
for Domestic Licensing Proceedings'' in 10 CFR Part 2. Interested persons should consult a current copy of 10 CFR 2.714
which is available at the Commission's Public Document Room, the Gelman Building, 2120 L Street, NW., Washington,
DC 20555 and at the local public document room for the particular facility involved. If a request for a hearing or petition
for leave to intervene is filed by the above date, the Commission or an Atomic Safety and Licensing Board, designated
by the Commission or by the Chairman of the Atomic Safety and Licensing Board Panel, will rule on the request and/or
petition; and the Secretary or the designated Atomic Safety and Licensing Board will issue a notice of a hearing or
an appropriate order. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
As required by 10 CFR 2.714, a petition for leave to intervene shall set forth with particularity the interest of the
petitioner in the proceeding, and how that interest may be affected by the results of the proceeding. The petition
should specifically explain the reasons why intervention should be permitted with particular reference to the following
factors: (1) the nature of the petitioner's right under the Act to be made a party to the proceeding; (2) the nature and
extent of the petitioner's property, financial, or other interest in the proceeding; and (3) the possible effect
of any order which may be entered in the proceeding on the petitioner's interest. The petition should also identify
the specific aspect(s) of the subject matter of the proceeding as to which petitioner wishes to intervene. Any person
who has filed a petition for leave to intervene or who has been admitted as a party may amend the petition without requesting
leave of the Board up to 15 days prior to the first prehearing conference scheduled in the proceeding, but such an amended
petition must satisfy the specificity requirements described above. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Not later than 15 days prior to the first prehearing conference scheduled in the proceeding, a petitioner shall file
a supplement to the petition to intervene which must include a list of the contentions which are sought to be litigated
in the matter. Each contention must consist of a specific statement of the issue of law or fact to be raised or controverted.
In addition, the petitioner shall provide a brief explanation of the bases of the contention and a concise statement
of the alleged facts or expert opinion which support the contention and on which the petitioner intends to rely in proving
the contention at the hearing. The petitioner must also provide references to those specific sources and documents
of which the petitioner is aware and on which the petitioner intends to rely to establish those facts or expert opinion.
Petitioner must provide sufficient information to show that a genuine dispute exists with the applicant on a material
issue of law or fact. Contentions shall be limited to matters within the scope of the amendment under consideration.
The contention must be one which, if proven, would entitle the petitioner to relief. A petitioner who fails to file
such a supplement which satisfies these requirements with respect to at least one contention will not be permitted
to participate as a party. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Those permitted to intervene become parties to the proceeding, subject to any limitations in the order granting leave
to intervene, and have the opportunity to participate fully in the conduct of the hearing, including the opportunity
to present evidence and cross-examine witnesses. Since the Commission has made a final determination that the amendment
involves no significant hazards consideration, if a hearing is requested, it will not stay the effectiveness of the
amendment. Any hearing held would take place while the amendment is in effect. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
A request for a hearing or a petition for leave to intervene must be filed with the Secretary of the Commission, U.S.
Nuclear Regulatory Commission, Washington, DC 20555, Attention: Docketing and Services Branch, or may be delivered
to the Commission's Public Document Room, the Gelman Building, 2120 L Street, NW., Washington, DC 20555, by the above
date. Where petitions are filed during the last 10 days of the notice period, it is requested that the petitioner promptly
so inform the Commission by a toll-free telephone call to Western Union at 1-(800) 248-5100 (in Missouri 1-(800) 342-6700).
The Western Union operator should be given Datagram Identification Number N1023 and the following message addressed
to 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 -->
(Project Director):
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 -->

notice. A copy of the petition should also be sent to the Office of the General Counsel, U.S. Nuclear Regulatory Commission,
Washington, DC 20555, and to the attorney for the licensee. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Nontimely filings of petitions for leave to intervene, amended petitions, supplemental petitions and/or requests
for a hearing will not be entertained absent a determination by the Commission, the presiding officer or the Atomic
Safety and Licensing Board that the petition and/or request should be granted based upon a balancing of the factors
specified in 10 CFR 2.714(a)(1)(i)-(v) and 2.714(d).

Brief description of amendment: 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The amendment revises the River Bend, Unit 1 Technical Specifications to permit extending the time to perform leak
rate testing of certain containment isolation valves and pressure isolation valves so that the testing can be performed
during the refueling outage scheduled to start April 16, 1994, rather than requiring an earlier shutdown solely to
perform the testing. Also, an exemption to 10 CFR Appendix J was issued on February 2, 1994, that provides an extension,
consistent with the revision to the technical specifications, to allow the testing of containment isolation valves
to be delayed until the refueling outage.
