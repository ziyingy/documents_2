Civil Penalty Adjustment for Corrective Action 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Corrective action is a significant factor in mitigation or escalation of base civil penalties for violations involving
discrimination. A paragraph is being added to B2(b) of Section VI of the Enforcement Policy to provide an explanation
of the corrective action adjustment factor as applied to discrimination cases. The NRC can require broad remedial
action to improve the workplace environment, but it cannot require a licensee to provide the individual with a personal
remedy. The Department of Labor (DOL) has the authority to require that a personal remedy be provided. A violation
involving discrimination is not completely corrected without the personal remedy, and the chilling effect may well
continue if a personal remedy is not provided. Thus the Commission does not believe that any proposed penalty should
be mitigated if a personal remedy is not provided. A civil penalty normally should be mitigated for corrective action
only if the licensee takes prompt, comprehensive corrective action which (1) addresses the broader environment
for raising concerns in the workplace; and (2) provides a remedy for the particular discrimination at issue. In the
determination of whether or not a remedy has been provided, the NRC considers whether a settlement has been reached
or if a remedy ordered by DOL has been implemented. Where a remedy has been accepted by DOL, NRC intends to defer to DOL
on the adequacy of the remedy. Cases where a licensee offers an employee a reasonable remedy, but the employee declines,
will be handled on a case by case basis. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The promptness and scope of corrective action should also be considered in applying the corrective action factor.
If settlement occurs early in the administrative process, mitigation may be warranted based on corrective actions
as the chilling effect may have been minimized by the promptness of the remedy and remedial action. However, if settlement
occurs after the evidentiary record closes before the Administrative Law Judge, then any existing chilling effect
may have existed for a substantial time, and the complainant may have had to spend substantial resources to present
his or her case. Under such situations mitigation normally would not be warranted. If the licensee does not take broad
corrective action until after a Secretary of Labor's decision, and the Secretary's decision upholds an Administrative
Law Judge's finding of discrimination, corrective action may be untimely and escalation warranted. If the licensee
chooses to litigate and eventually prevails on the merits of the case, then enforcement action will not be taken and,
if already initiated, will be withdrawn. Assuming that evidence of discrimination exists, enforcement action that
emphasizes the value of promptly counteracting the potential chilling effect is warranted.

Enforcement Discretion 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
It is recognized that there are some cases of discrimination where enforcement action may not be warranted. Paragraph
B(7) is being added to Section VII to provide an explanation of the types of cases in which the NRC may refrain from taking
enforcement action and those in which the NRC normally would not exercise such discretion. A licensee who, without
the need for government intervention, identifies an issue of discrimination and takes corrective action to address
both the particular situation and the overall work environment is helping to establish a safety-conscious workplace.
Aggressive licensee follow-up also provides a message that retaliation is not acceptable within its workplace.
Assuming that these actions are reasonable and effective, NRC enforcement action may not be warranted. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Another situation in which enforcement may not be warranted is where a complaint is filed with the DOL, but the licensee
settles the matter before the DOL Area Office makes a finding of discrimination. Alternatively, if a finding is made
against the licensee, the licensee may choose to settle before the evidentiary hearing begins. An NRC policy of not
normally citing violations in such cases might encourage licensee settlements, thereby reducing the potential
for chilling effect. Settlements also provide a more timely remedy for the complainant and may be used to demonstrate
the licensee's commitment to a retaliation-free environment. Therefore, the NRC may exercise its discretion not
to take enforcement action when the licensee has publicized (1) that a complaint of discrimination for engaging in
protected activity was made to the DOL; (2) that the matter was settled to the satisfaction of the employee (the terms
of the specific settlement agreement need not be posted); and (3) that if the DOL Area Office found discrimination,
the licensee has taken action to positively reemphasize that discrimination will not be tolerated. This information
might be publicized by posting a notice, a newsletter, a handout, or some other means, but the information should be
conveyed in a manner designed to minimize the chilling effect on others. A similar approach may be taken when a person
comes to the NRC without going to the DOL. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Even if no formal enforcement action is taken, the NRC would issue a letter, as is normal practice in similar cases,
to emphasize the need for lasting remedial action. The licensee would also be informed that future violations may
result in enforcement action. In certain cases, the NRC may also consider entering into a consent order with the licensee,
as part of the settlement process, to address remedial action. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Whether the exercise of discretion is appropriate will depend on the circumstances. For example, normally enforcement
discretion would not be appropriate for cases that involve: (1) Allegations of discrimination as a result of providing
information directly to the NRC; (2) allegations of discrimination caused by a manager above first-line supervisor
(consistent with the current Enforcement Policy classification of Severity Level I or II violations); (3) allegations
of discrimination where a history of findings of discrimination (by the DOL or the NRC) or settlements suggest a programmatic
rather than an isolated discrimination problem; (4) allegations of discrimination which appear particularly blatant
or egregious.

 In addition enforcement discretion normally would not be exercised for cases where the licensee does not appropriately
address the overall work environment (e.g. by using training, postings, revised policies or procedures, any necessary
disciplinary action, etc. to communicate corporate policy against discrimination).

 While enforcement action would normally be warranted in these four types of cases, depending on the circumstances
mitigation for corrective action may be appropriate.
