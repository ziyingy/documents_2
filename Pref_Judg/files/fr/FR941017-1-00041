SSA is considering the adoption of the same guidelines for determining the availability of treatment to title II and
title XVI beneficiaries. However, we would like to receive any comments on whether these guidelines are adequate
or if other factors should be considered. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Questions: 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
How should SSA define available substance abuse treatment? Should availability take into consideration the client's
access to transportation, education, familial situation and/or health? What other factors should be considered,
if any? Should clients seeking readmission to treatment after a period of noncompliance be given priority for a treatment
slot over other clients awaiting initial intake into treatment?

C. Defining and Measuring Progress 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Currently, SSA has no rules for defining and measuring progress expected to be achieved by participants in treatment
programs. The law requires that such regulations be developed in establishing guidelines used to review and evaluate
compliance with treatment. Treatment professionals may have differing views and opinions on defining and measuring
progress. Progress is related to compliance. Currently, providers determine treatment and measures of progress.
The difficult task for SSA is to determine to what extent it can be externally validated. SSA is considering defining
parameters of progress as clinical measures, such as attendance, participation in activities, changes in physical
and mental limitations, degree of abstinence, drug testing results, attitude, cooperation, mental/psychological
status and instances of relapse.

Questions: 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
What constitutes progress in substance abuse treatment? What are the most effective and reliable means of measuring
progress in substance abuse treatment? How can these be quantified and reported regularly in a cost-effective mode?
What methods currently exist for validating progress with treatment?

D. Evaluating Compliance With Treatment 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Currently, there are no specific guidelines in the regulations to evaluate beneficiaries' compliance with the treatment
requirements. Determinations on compliance generally have been based on judgments made by employees of the treatment
facilities or of the RMAs under contract with SSA. The statute requires that the Secretary issue regulations establishing
guidelines for evaluating whether individuals entitled to benefits based on DA&amp;A are in compliance and progressing
with treatment requirements. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
There are a wide range of issues that pertain to evaluating compliance with treatment, including views on how to define
success within a treatment modality. For example, some believe that individuals can be expected to undergo periods
of drug or alcohol use even though they are following a treatment plan in large part.

Questions: 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
What are the factors we should use to evaluate compliance with substance abuse treatment? How should a relapse be treated
or evaluated for purposes of compliance? Are there varying degrees of relapse which may or may not indicate noncompliance?
While one isolated incident may not be defined as noncompliance, what number of ``second chances'' should be provided?
Should positive drug or alcohol tests be used as a tool to measure compliance? If yes, how, i.e., a single test, a certain
number of tests, or tests in conjunction with other indicators? If other indicators should be factored in, what are
those indicators? How reliable are these tests? Are there other types of testing or criteria that could be used to monitor
compliance with the substance abuse treatment requirements? How frequently should testing be done? What are the
customary and reasonable charges for testing? How and by whom are test specimens (blood, urine, breath) collected?
Should this be done outside a clinical or laboratory setting, and can it be done properly and effectively outside such
a setting? If so, please provide examples of appropriate nonclinic-based procedures.

How should SSA evaluate compliance with Alcoholics Anonymous and Narcotics Anonymous? SSA is considering a requirement
for individuals to get signed statements of attendance.

E. Frequency of Monitoring by the RMA 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Currently, the treatment requirements have been applicable only to title XVI beneficiaries, and not to title II beneficiaries.
Accordingly, although there are RMAs under contract in most States, they serve only the title XVI population and the
referral and monitoring work presently being performed is not as extensive as the new legislation requires. There
are no regulations regarding the referral and monitoring functions.
