Information Management_The goals of this project are: (i) to provide the organization and focus through which data
producers, data managers and data users actively participate in the design, implementation and review of the NOAA
Climate and Global Change (C&amp;GC) information management system, (ii) to assist in construction of data and information
(metadata) sets required by C&amp;GC researchers, (iii) to provide users with easy access to C&amp;GC data and information,
and (iv) to manage long-term C&amp;GC data and information archives. Proposals are sought which are clearly linked
to the specific scientific objectives of the NOAA C&amp;GC Program and which are under the direction of a scientific
principal investigator. Proposals to enhance system and infrastructure responsibilities without firm science
driven objectives will not be considered. Priorities include construction of long-term climate and global change
data sets and information products involving data assembly, digitization, quality control and data rescue, and
support of information management applicable to national and international research programs. For further information

Global Energy and Water Cycle Experiment (GEWEX)_This program element replaces Atmospheric and Land Surface Processes
(ALSP) listed in previous announcements. In FY95, NOAA's principal contribution to GEWEX will be directed at improving
our understanding of physical processes associated with the transfer of heat, moisture and momentum across the land/atmosphere
interface and through the atmospheric boundary layer. Particular emphasis will be placed on issues involving the
scale integration of these processes in climate models. The focus for this activity is the GEWEX Continental-scale
International Project (GCIP) centered on the Mississippi River Basin. Also to be supported within this program element
will be proposals addressing the role of aerosols in forcing climate variability and change, with a focus on the forthcoming
series of Aerosol Characterization Experiments (ACE&hyph;1 &amp; 2). For further information contact: Michael
Coughlan, NOAA/Office of Global Programs, Silver Spring, MD; 301&hyph;427&hyph;2089 ext. 40, OMNET: M.Coughlan,

Marine Ecosystem Response_The principal objective of the Marine Ecosystem Response Program is to determine the
relationship between ecosystem dynamics and the climatic variability associated with global change. The majority
of the resources of this program will be devoted to the USGCRP Global Ocean Ecosystem Dynamics (U.S.GLOBEC) program.
A solicitation for proposals, separate from this announcement, will be issued by the jointly supported (NSF/NOAA)
U.S. GLOBEC program, and will be directed at the ongoing U.S. GLOBEC Northwest Atlantic Field Study and the planned
California Current study. In addition to U.S. GLOBEC activities, some resources will be devoted to the early detection
of climate change. Under this activity, modest proposals may be sought for the development of coordinated, scientifically
based monitoring of coral reef ecosystems and other innovative pilot projects that might contribute to early detection
of climate change. For further information, contact Mark Eakin, NOAA/Global Programs, Silver Spring, MD; 301&hyph;427&hyph;2089

Paleoclimatology_The Paleoclimatology Program solicits proposals that will make significant advances in our
understanding of decade-to-century-scale variability in the climate system. This includes development of new,
high-resolution time series from climatically-sensitive areas presently without adequate data coverage (e.g.,
the tropics and Southern Hemisphere), and datasets that reconstruct large-scale historical patterns of climatic
change that can be used to verify climate and ocean models. FY 1995 proposals may be submitted for either research (both
field and analytical work) or database development. Further details will be published in the next issue of ``The Paleoclimate
Data Record'' published by the World Data Center_A for Paleoclimatology at NOAA/NGDC. For an information sheet or
more information, contact Mark Eakin, NOAA/Global Programs, Silver Spring, MD; 301&hyph;427&hyph;2089 ext. 710,

Economics and Human Dimensions of Climate Fluctuations_A new 1995 program element representing the merging of the
Economics and Human Dimensions programs is under consideration at this time. The objective is to promote multidisciplinary
research that increases our understanding of the impacts of climate on human forcing functions of environmental
change. The Program is also intended to provide opportunities for proposals in economics, anthropology, geography,
sociology, and policy sciences to yield insight into this complex relationship. Because funding for new starts may
be limited, a more tightly focussed program will reflect an emphasis, where appropriate, on seasonal to interannual
time scales. For 1995, proposals on the following topics will be considered: (1) Economics research on the value of
scientific and economic information and decision-making frameworks relating to climate fluctuation; (2) historical
and archeological perspectives on climate change; and (3) climate-human interactions, including anthropogenic
activities affecting climate variability/change, as well as social and economic consequences of and adaptation
to climate fluctuation. Within any of the above topics, a focus on coastal issues is welcomed. NOAA's mission includes
human adaptations and vulnerabilities, coastal infrastructure, and governance and management. Interdisciplinary
teams of researchers that include both physical and social scientists are strongly encouraged. Investigators considering
submitting a proposal are strongly encouraged to contact program officials for preliminary discussion of ideas,
and are urged to submit letters of intent prior to proposal submission. For an information sheet containing further
details, contact: Claudia Nierenberg, NOAA/Office of Global Programs, Silver Spring, MD; 301&hyph;427&hyph;2089
