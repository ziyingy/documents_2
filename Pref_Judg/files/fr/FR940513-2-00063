<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
(1) The General Services Administration (GSA) is responsible, under the provisions of the Federal Property and Administrative
Services Act of 1949, as amended, for the Federal Standardization Program. On August 14, 1972, the Administrator
of GSA designated the National Communications System (NCS) as the responsible agent for the development of telecommunications
standards for interoperability of U.S. Government communications systems.

Federal Register
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 (57 FR 11731) that proposed FED&hyph;STD 1055 entitled ``Telecommunications: Interoperability Requirements
for Meteor Burst Radio Communications Between Conventional Master and Remote Stations''; FED&hyph;STD 1056 entitled
``Telecommunications: Interoperability Requirements for the Encryption of Meteor Burst Radio Communications;''
and FED&hyph;STD 1057 entitled ``Telecommunications: Interoperability Requirements for Meteor Burst Radio Communications
Between Networks by Conventional Master Stations'' were being proposed for Federal use and that comments were requested.

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
1. Scope.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 The terms and accompanying definitions contained in these standards are drawn from authoritative U.S. Government
sources such as the Department of Defense and the National Telecommunications and Information Administration and
several authoritative U.S. Government publications. The Meteor Burst Communications Subcommittee to the Federal
Telecommunications Standards Committee (FTSC) has developed a family of technical specifications for use by systems
that use meteor trails as the primary mechanism for communications.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
1.2.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
 Applicability.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 All Federal departments and agencies shall use Federal Standards FED&hyph;STD 1055, ``Telecommunications: Interoperability
Requirements for Meteor Burst Radio Communications Between Conventional Master and Remote Stations,'' FED&hyph;STD
1056, ``Telecommunications: Interoperability Requirements for the Encryption of Meteor Burst Radio Communications,''
and FED&hyph;STD 1057, ``Telecommunications: Interoperability Requirements for meteor Burst Radio Communications
Between Networks by Conventional Master Stations'' in the design and procurement of all Meteor Burst Communication
equipment to be used on Government authorized radio frequencies, except for (1) Equipment used for remote sensing
applications; (2) equipment employing spread spectrum modulation; (3) equipment that dynamically changes data
rate during meteor trails. The use of these standards by all Federal departments and agencies is mandatory.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
1.2. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Purpose.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 The purpose of this standard is to improve the Federal acquisition process by providing Federal departments and agencies
with a comprehensive, authoritative source for meteor burst communications.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 The radio characteristics, modulation, data rates, and message broadcast procedures and format defined in these
standards are to be applied to the design and procurement of meteor burst communications equipment. These are a family
of Federal Telecommunications Standards and each contains a list of other Federal standards that may be applicable
to implementation of these standards.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
3. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Use.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 All Federal departments and agencies shall use these standards in the design and procurement of meteor burst communication
equipment. Only after determining that a requirement is not included in these documents may other sources be used.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
4. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Effective Date.

5. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Changes.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 When a Federal department or agency considers that these standards do not provide for its essential needs, a statement
citing inadequacies shall be sent in duplicate to the General Services Administration, Regulations Analysis Division
(KMR), Washington, DC 20405, in accordance with the provisions of the Federal Information Resources Management
Regulation, Subpart 201&hyph;20.3. The General Services Administration will determine the appropriate action
to be taken and will notify the agency. Federal departments and agencies are encouraged to submit updates and corrections
to these standards, which will be considered for the next revision of this standard. The General Services Administration
has delegated the compilation of suggested changes to the National Communications System whose address is given
below: Office of the Manager, National Communications System, Office of Techonolgy and Standards, Washington,
DC 20305&hyph;2010.
