<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
 of May 25, 1988 (53 FR 18897), EPA issued a notice announcing that Hoechst Celanese Corp., Route 202-208 North, Sommerville,
NJ 08878, had submitted a pesticide petition (PP 8F3607) proposing to amend 40 CFR part 180 by establishing a regulation
pursuant to section 408 of the Federal Food, Drug and Cosmetic Act, 21 U.S.C. 346a, to permit the residues of the herbicide
monoammonium 2-amino-4-(hydroxymethylphosphinyl)-butanoate (expressed as 2-amino-4-(hydroxymethylphosphinyl)-butanoic
acid) and 3-methylphosphinicopropionic acid (expressed as 2-amino-4-(hydroxymethylphosphinyl)-butanoic
acid), in or on soybean seed, apples, grapes, field corn (grain, forage, silage, and fodder), and nuts at 0.05 ppm and
almond hulls at 0.50 ppm. This petition was assigned the number 8F3607. The proposed analytical method for determining
residues was high-pressure liquid chromatography.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
There were no comments of request for referral to an advisory committee received in response to the notice of filing.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The petitioner subsequently amended the petition by withdrawing the tolerance proposal for residues of the active
ingredient and its metabolite in or on soybean seed, field corn grain, field corn forage, field corn silage, and field
corn fodder. Since this revision decreases the pesticide burden on the environment, it was not published for comment.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The data submitted in the petition and other relevant material have been evaluated. The toxicology data listed below
were considered in support of these tolerances.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
1. A battery of acute toxicity studies placing technical glufosinate-ammonium in Toxicity Categories II and III.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
2. A 90-day feeding study in rats at dietary intakes of 0, 0.52, 4.1, 32, or 263 mg/kg/day with a no-observed-effect
level (NOEL) of 4.1 mg/kg/day. The lowest-observed-effect level (LOEL) was established at 32 mg/kg/day based on
increased absolute and relative kidney weights.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
3. A 90-day feeding study in mice at dietary intakes of 0, 16.6, 67.1, or 278 mg/kg/day with a NOEL of 16.6 mg/kg/day and
a LOEL of 67.1 mg/kg/day based on increased absolute and relative liver weights (both sexes) and an increase in serum
potassium levels (males).
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
4. Three teratology studies in rats at doses from 0.5 to 250 mg/kg/day with no teratogenic effects occurring up to and
including 250 mg/kg/day. A NOEL for developmental toxicity was 2.24 mg/kg/day, based upon an increase in the incidence
of dilated renal pelvis with hydroureter in the fetuses at 10 mg/kg/day. The maternal NOEL was also 2.24 mg/kg/day.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
5. A teratology study in rabbits at doses of 0, 2, 6.3, or 20 mg/kg/day with no teratogenic effects occurring up to and
including 20 mg/kg/day, and a maternal NOEL of 6.3 mg/kg/day and a developmental NOEL of 20 mg/kg/day, the highest
dose tested.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
6. A two-generation reproduction study in rats at dietary concentrations of 0, 40, 120, or 360 ppm with a NOEL for reproductive
effects at 120 ppm (equivalent to 12 mg/kg/day) based upon reduced number of pups in the high dose group. The NOEL for
parental toxicity was also 120 ppm based upon increased kidney weights in the high-dose group.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
7. A 12-month feeding study in dogs at doses of 0, 2, 5, or 8.5 mg/kg/day. The NOEL was 5.0 mg/kg/day based upon the death
of one male and one female dog at 8.5 mg/kg/day with no other treatment-related toxicity.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
8. A mouse carcinogenicity study at doses of 0, 2.8, 10.8, or 22.7 mg/kg/day in males and 0, 4.2, 16.2, or 64.0 mg/kg/day
in females for 104 weeks with no carcinogenic effects observed under the conditions of the study up to and including
64 mg/kg/day and a systemic NOEL of 10.8 and 16.2 for males and females, respectively, based on the dose-related increase
in mortality.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
9. A chronic feeding/carcinogenicity study in rats at dietary doses of 0, 2.5, 8.8, or 31.5 mg/kg/day (males) and 0,
2.4, 8.2, or 28.7 mg/kg/day (females) with a NOEL of 2.1 mg/kg/day for systemic effects based on an increase in mortality
rate in females at the two higher doses. There were no treatment-related carcinogenic effects at any dose level.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
10. Acceptable studies on gene mutation (Salmonella, E. coli, and mouse lymphoma assays), structural chromosomal
aberration (
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
in vivo
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 micronucleus assay in mice), and other genotoxic effects (unscheduled DNA synthesis assay with rat hepatocytes)
yielded negative results.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
11. Pharmacokinetic and metabolism studies which indicated that approximately 80 to 90 percent of the orally administered
dose of glufosinate ammonium remained unabsorbed and was eliminated in the feces. Approximately 10 to 15 percent
was eliminated in the urine. The major metabolic pathway is oxidative deamination yielding the metabolite, 3-methyl-phospinico
propionic acid.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The chronic analysis used a Reference Dose (RfD) of 0.02 mg/kg body weight/day, based on a NOEL of 2.1 mg/kg/day and
an uncertainty factor of 100. The NOEL is based on a 2-year rat feeding study that demonstrated increased absolute
and relative kidney weight in males as an endpoint effect.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Using tolerance-level residues and assumptions that 100 percent of every crop for which glufosinate-ammonium has
a proposed use is treated, the total Theoretical Maximum Residue Contribution (TMRC) for the general population
and the highest exposed subgroup in DRES are as follows (as percents of RFD): General population, 0.3 percent; nonnursing
infants less than 1 year old, 2.1 percent.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
A data gap currently exists for a rat carcinogenicity study. The tolerances will be time-limited because of this gap.
The time limitation allows for development and review of the data.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The analysis for glufosinate-ammonium using tolerance level residues suggests that the proposed uses on apples,
grapes, and nuts (excluding almonds) will not cause exposure to exceed the levels at which the Agency believes there
is an appreciable risk. All DRES subgroups are below 100 of the RfD for chronic effects.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The pesticide is useful for the purposes for which these tolerances are sought. The nature of the residue is adequately
understood for the purpose of establishing these tolerances. Adequate analytical methodology (gas chromatography
with flame photometric detection of phosphorus) is available for enforcement purposes. Because of the long lead
time from establishing these tolerances to publication, the enforcement methodology is being made available in
the interim to anyone interested in pesticide enforcement when requested by mail from: Calvin Furlow, Public Response
Branch, Field Operations Division (7506C), Office of Pesticide Programs. Environmental Protection Agency, 401
M St., Washington, DC 20460. Office location and telephone number: Rm. 1130A, CM #2, 1921 Jefferson Davis Hwy., Arlington,
VA 22202, (703)-305-5937.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
There are currently no actions pending against the registration of this chemical. There is no reasonable expectation
that secondary residues will occur in meat, fat, and meat byproducts of cattle, goats, hogs, horses, sheep, or poultry,
nor is there any reasonable expectation that secondary residues will occur in eggs or milk.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Based on the information cited above, the Agency has determined that the establishment of the tolerances by amending
40 CFR part 180 will protect the public health; therefore, the tolerances are established as set forth below.

, file written objections with the Hearing Clerk, at the address given above. 40 CFR 178.20. The objections submitted
must specify the provisions of the regulation deemed objectionable and the grounds for the objections. 40 CFR 178.25.
Each objection must be accompanied by the fee prescribed by 40 CFR 180.33(i). If a hearing is requested, the objections
must include a statement of the factual issue(s) on which a hearing is requested, the requestor's contentions on each
such issue, and a summary of any evidence relied upon by the objector. 40 CFR 178.27. A request for a hearing will be granted
if the Administrator determines that the material submitted shows the following: There is a genuine and substantial
issue of fact; there is a reasonable possibility that available evidence identified by the requestor would, if established,
resolve one or more of such issues in favor of the requestor, taking into account uncontested claims or facts to the
contrary; and resolution of the factual issue (s) in the manner sought by the requestor would be adequate to justify
the action requested. 40 CFR 1798.32

Pursuant to the requirements of the Regulatory Flexibility Act (Pub. L. 96-354, 94 Stat. 1164, 5 U.S.C. 601-612),
the Administrator has determined that regulations establishing new tolerance or raising tolerance levels or establishing
exemptions from tolerance requirements do not have a significant economic impact on a substantial number of small
entities. A certification statement to this effect was published in the
