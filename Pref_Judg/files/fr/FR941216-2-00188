The Board determined that pursuant to section 552b(c) (3) and (10) of Title 5, United States Code, and section 7.3(c)
and (j) of Title 39, Code of Federal Regulations, this portion of the meeting is exempt from the open meeting requirement
of the Government in the Sunshine Act [5 U.S.C. 552b(b)] because it is likely to disclose information in connection
with proceedings under Chapter 36 of Title 39, United States Code (having to do with postal ratemaking, mail classification
and changes in postal services), which is specifically exempted from disclosure by section 410(c)(4) of Title 39,
United States Code.

7.3(j) of Title 39, Code of Federal Regulations, the discussion of Docket No. R90&hyph;1 is exempt because it is likely
to specifically concern participation of the Postal Service in a civil action or proceeding involving a determination
on the record after opportunity for a hearing.
