The California Coastal Act regulates the approval of developments 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
within the coastal zone. Although a significant slowing in wetland 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
losses has occurred, the continued loss and degradation of coastal 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
wetlands since the California Coastal Act was enacted in 1974 attests 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
to the limitations of this legislation.

existence.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
By far, the most significant natural factor adversely 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
affecting the tidewater goby is drought and resultant deterioration of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
coastal and riparian habitats. California has recently experienced 5 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
consecutive years of lower than average rainfall. These drought 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
conditions, when combined with human induced water reductions (i.e., 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
diversions of water from streams, excessive groundwater withdrawals), 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
have degraded coastal and riparian ecosystems and have created extremely 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
stressful conditions for most aquatic species. Formerly large 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
populations of tidewater gobies have declined in numbers because of the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
reduced availability of suitable lagoon habitats (i.e., San Simeon 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Creek, Pico Creek), others disappeared when the lagoons dried (i.e., 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Santa Rosa Creek). In San Luis Obispo County alone, 6 of 20 populations 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
of tidewater gobies were extirpated between 1984 and 1989 because of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
drought, water diversions, and pollution (K. Worcester, pers. comm., 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
1991). 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Habitat degradation and losses of the tidewater goby from weather 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
related phenomena commonly occur due to the restriction of the species 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
to coastal lagoon systems and its dependence on freshwater inflows. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Events such as river flooding and heavy rainfall have been reported to 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
destroy goby burrows and wash gobies out to sea. Storm surges that 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
enter a lagoon may also adversely affect entire goby populations by 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
rapidly changing its salinity. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The tidewater goby was undoubtedly subjected to such natural flood 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
events even before major human alteration of drainage basins. As 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
mentioned under Factor A, channelization and urbanization have increased 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the frequency and perhaps the intensity of such flood events. In 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
addition, populations of gobies are becoming more isolated from one 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
another as intervening populations are extirpated, thus further 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
decreasing the likelihood of successfully colonizing and reestablishing 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
a population lost to a ``natural'' flood. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Competition with introduced species is a potential threat to the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
tidewater goby. Although problems have not been documented so far, the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
spread of two introduced oriental gobies (yellowfin goby (
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Acanthogobius 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
flavimanus
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
) and chameleon goby (
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Tridentiger trigonocephalus
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
)) may have a detrimental effect on the tidewater goby. According to Swift 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
et al. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
(1990), the chameleon goby was recently found in Pyramid Lake, probably 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
imported with central California water. If this goby becomes 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
established in the Santa Clara River as other imported species have 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(e.g., prickly sculpin (
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Cottus asper
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
)), the tidewater goby population at 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the mouth of the Santa Clara River may be at risk. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Service has carefully assessed the best scientific and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
commercial information available regarding the past, present, and future 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
threats faced by this species in determining to make this rule final. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The tidewater goby has been extirpated from nearly 50 percent of the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
lagoons within its historic range, including 74 percent of the lagoons 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
south of Morro Bay. Forty-three populations remain; however, only six 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
are large in number and reasonably free from immediate threats. Based 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
on this evaluation, the preferred action is to list the tidewater goby 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
as endangered. The tidewater goby has experienced a substantial decline 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
throughout its historic range and faces threats indicating that this 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
downward trend is likely to continue. This species lives within 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
specific habitat zones that have been, and will continue to be, targeted 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
for development and degradation by human activities. The goby is 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
extremely vulnerable to adverse habitat modification and water quality 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
changes. The tidewater goby is in imminent danger of extinction 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
throughout its range and requires the full protection of listing as 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
endangered under the Act to survive. For reasons discussed below, the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Service is not proposing to designate critical habitat for this fish 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
species at this time.
