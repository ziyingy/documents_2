7. Applicability. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->
This standard is applicable to all Federal agencies that use cryptographic-based security systems to protect unclassified
information within computer and telecommunication systems (including voice systems) that are not subject to Section
2315 of Title 10, U.S. Code, or Section 3502(2) of Title 44, U.S. Code. This standard shall be used in designing, acquiring
and implementing cryptographic-based security systems within computer and telecommunication systems (including
voice systems), operated by a Federal agency or by a contractor of a Federal agency or other organization that processes
information (using a computer or telecommunications system) on behalf of the Federal Government to accomplish a
Federal function. Federal agencies which use cryptographic-based security systems for protecting classified
information may use those systems for protecting unclassified information in lieu of systems that comply with this
standard. Non-Federal government organizations are encouraged to adopt and use this standard when it provides the
desired security for protecting valuable or sensitive information.

Applications. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->
Cryptographic-based security systems may be utilized in various computer and telecommunication (including voice)
applications (e.g., data storage, access control and personal identification, radio, facsimile, video) and in
various environments (e.g., centralized computer facilities, office environments, hostile environments). The
cryptographic services (e.g., encryption, authentication, digital signature, key management) provided by a cryptographic
module will be based on many factors which are specific to the application and environment. The security level of a
cryptographic module shall be chosen to provide a level of security appropriate for the security requirements of
the application and environment in which the module is to be utilized and the security services which the module is
to provide. The security requirements for a particular security level include both the security requirements specific
to that level and the security requirements that apply to all modules regardless of the level. System characteristics
not related to security (e.g., telecommunications interoperability) are beyond the scope of this standard.

This standard covers implementations of cryptographic modules including, but not limited to, hardware components
or modules, software programs or modules, computer firmware, or any combination thereof. Cryptographic modules
that are validated by NIST, or that comply with the requirements of the FIPS 140&hyph;1 implementation and FIPS 140
acquisition schedules in Section 14 of the announcement of this standard, will be considered as complying with this
standard. Information about the FIPS 140&hyph;1 validation program can be obtained from the National Institute
of Standards and Technology, Computer Systems Laboratory, Gaithersburg, MD 20899.

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->
Cryptographic modules that comply with this standard shall employ cryptographic algorithms, cryptographic key
generation algorithms and key distribution techniques, and authentication techniques that have been FIPS approved
for protecting Federal Government unclassified information. FIPS approved cryptographic algorithms, cryptographic
key generation algorithms and key distribution techniques, and authentication techniques include those that are
either:
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
a. Specified in a Federal Information Processing Standard (FIPS), or
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
b. Adopted in a FIPS and specified either in an appendix to the FIPS or in a document referenced by the FIPS.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
If a cryptographic module is required to incorporate a trusted operating system, then the module shall employ trusted
operating systems that have been evaluated by a NIST accredited evaluation authority and against a FIPS approved
evaluation criteria.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Information about approved cryptographic methods and approved operating system evaluation authorities and criteria
can be obtained from NIST.

Export Control. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->
Certain cryptographic devices and technical data regarding them are deemed to be defense articles (i.e., inherently
military in character) and are subject to Federal government export controls as specified in Title 22, Code of Federal
Regulations, parts 120&hyph;128. Some exports of cryptographic modules conforming to this standard and technical
data regarding them must comply with these Federal regulations and be licensed by the U.S. Department of State. Other
exports of cryptographic modules conforming to this standard and technical data regarding them fall under the licensing
authority of the Bureau of Export Administration of the U.S. Department of Commerce. The Department of Commerce is
responsible for licensing cryptographic devices used for authentication, access control, proprietary software,
automatic teller machines (ATMs), and certain devices used in other equipment and software. For advice concerning
which agency has licensing authority for a particular cryptographic device, please contact the respective agencies.
