SUMMARY: 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
Under the provisions of the Domestic Chemical Diversion Control Act of 1993 (DCDCA), which was enacted on December
17, 1993, and becomes effective April 16, 1994, any person who manufactures, distributes, imports or exports a list
I chemical (formerly known as a precursor chemical), or who proposes to do so, must first obtain a registration.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Since regulations implementing the DCDCA may not be finalized by April 16, 1994, DEA is establishing a temporary exemption
from the registration requirement for any person who must register under the DCDCA. The exemption will stay in effect
for each affected person until DEA has either approved the person's application for registration or the Administrator
has issued a final order regarding the application, provided that the person makes proper application for registration
within 45 days of the effective date of the regulations implementing the DCDCA. Failure to submit to a proper application
within this time period will invalidate the exemption. At this time, affected persons are requested to submit to DEA
a notice of their intent to seek registration.

SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
On December 17, 1993, the Domestic Chemical Diversion Control Act of 1993 was enacted. The DCDCA redesignates precursor
chemicals and essential chemicals in Title 21, section 802, as list I chemicals and list II chemicals respectively,
and requires that any person who manufactures, distributes, imports or exports a list I chemical shall obtain an annual
registration from DEA for each location where such activities are carried out. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The DCDCA also removes the exemption from the definition of a regulated transaction for drugs marketed or distributed
under the Food, Drug and Cosmetic Act which either, (1) contain ephedrine or its salts, optical isomers, or salts of
optical isomers either as the only active medicinal ingredient or in combination with therapeutically insignificant
quantities of another active medicinal ingredient, or (2) contain another listed chemical which DEA has determined
is being diverted to obtain the listed chemical for use in the manufacture of a controlled substance. As a result, any
person who manufactures, imports, exports or distributes, either by wholesale or retail sales, any drug described
above will be required to register and will also be subject to the applicable requirements of the DCDCA and title 21,
Code of Federal Regulations, parts 1310 and 1313, when the DCDCA becomes effective on April 16, 1994. Those persons
manufacturing, distributing, importing, or exporting drugs distributed or marketed under the Food, Drug and Cosmetic
Act which contain ephedrine in combination with therapeutically significant quantities of another drug will remain
exempt from the requirements of the DCDCA and the applicable portions of title 21 of the regulations. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The DCDCA also establishes certain other requirements with respect to listed chemicals which will be addressed in
a separate

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 notice proposing the establishment of regulations implementing the DCDCA. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In the event that the regulations and administrative mechanisms to implement the DCDCA are not finalized prior to
the April 16, 1994 effective date, DEA is establishing a temporary exemption from the registration requirement for
affected persons who manufacture, distribute, import or export list I chemicals. Each affected person will be exempted
from the registration requirement until they have made proper application for registration with DEA, provided such
application is made within 45 days after the effective date of the regulations implementing the DCDCA, and that application
has either been approved by DEA or the Administrator has issued a final order regarding the application following
a full administrative proceeding pursuant to sections 823 and 824 of the Controlled Substances Act. Failure to make
proper application within the specified time period will result in loss of the exemption. Further, the exemption
will apply only to the requirement to register which goes into effect in April 16, 1994. All other requirements of the
DCDCA become effective on April 16, 1994, and the requirements of parts 1310 and 1313 of title 21 of the regulations
will remain in full force and effect. The change in the designation of the regulated chemicals from precursor and essential
to list I and list II chemicals will have no effect on the requirements of parts 1310 and 1313.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
To assist DEA in ensuring that the necessary information regarding registration and application forms reaches the
affected persons, these persons are requested to notify DEA at this time of their intent to register for their activities.
The notice should reflect the name under which business is conducted, the address at which the list I chemical activities
are conducted, the type of activity (i.e., manufacture, distribute, import or export), and the specific list I chemical(s)
involved. Notice should be submitted for each separate physical location at which such activities are carried out.
Notices should be sent to:
