Since individuals successfully establishing themselves in self-employment will not collect EB, the UTF will accrue
some savings to the Extended Unemployment Compensation Account and the State's account. However, since EB is not
always payable in a State, the Department has determined that this ``no cost'' requirement will be met only if:
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(1) The State implements a profiling system which assures that only claimants likely to exhaust regular UC will receive
SEA allowances. An inadequate profiling system were those likely to not exhaust regular UC are allowed to receive
SEA allowances will not meet the ``no cost'' requirement.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(2) The State creates ``participation requirements'' designed to assure SEA allowances are paid only to those who
actually participate in the SEA program. Participation requirements for determining if an individual is actively
engaged on a full-time basis in SEA activities must be at least as stringent as the able and available requirements
for regular UC; otherwise the SEA program will not meet the ``no cost'' requirement.

State Reports.

Section 507(c), NAFTA, provides that any State operating a SEA program authorized by the Secretary of Labor must report
annually to the Secretary the number of individuals who participate in the SEA program, the number of individuals
who are able to develop and sustain businesses (e.g., business survival data), the cost of operating the SEA program,
and compliance with program requirements. The report must also contain other relevant data needed by the Department,
including data related to business income, number of employees and wages paid in the new businesses, and incidence
and duration of unemployment after business start-up.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
State reports will be submitted with respect to a calendar year and will be due the June 30 following the report year.
This means the first report may be for only part of a year. For example, if a State's SEA program is effective April 1,
1994, then the first annual report will be due on June 30, 1995 and will cover a nine-month period.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Failure to submit the report as required will create an issue under section 303(a)(6), SSA, which requires that, as
a condition of receipt of administrative grants for the UC program, State law provides for ``the making of such reports,
in such form and containing such information, as the Secretary of Labor may from time to time require *&blank;*&blank;*.''

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Under section 507(d), NAFTA, the Secretary of Labor is required to submit a report to Congress with respect to the SEA
program not later than four years after the date of enactment of NAFTA. Since NAFTA was enacted on December 8, 1993,
this report is due no later than December 8, 1997. This report will be based on the reports from the States operating
SEA programs.

Individuals Receiving SEA considered to be Unemployed. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->
As noted in item 4.a, section 3306(h) defines ``compensation'' as ``cash benefits payable to individuals with respect
to their unemployment.'' Payments to self-employed individuals are not compensation since they are not payable
with respect to unemployment. However, under section 3306(t)(2)(c), FUTA, individuals to whom the SEA allowances
are payable ``are considered to be unemployed for the purposes of Federal and State laws applicable to unemployment
compensation, as long as such individuals meet the requirements'' of section 3306(t). The effect of this provision
is that, with respect to SEA, individuals are considered to be unemployed and payments made to them are considered
to be ``compensation.'' Thus, the term ``compensation'' is considered to include individuals eligible for SEA allowances.
The term ``regular compensation'' does not, however, include SEA allowances. This is because under Section 3306(t)(1),
FUTA, SEA is payable ``in lieu of'' regular UC.

Equal Treatment Requirements Elsewhere in Federal Law. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->
In addition to the SEA ``equal treatment'' requirement in Section 3306(t)(2), FUTA, Federal law contains two other
equal treatment requirements mandating payment of compensation ``in the same amount, on the same terms, and subject
to the same conditions'' as UC payable under State law. One requirement is found in section 3304(a)(6)(A), FUTA, and
pertains to payment of UC based on services performed for State and local governments and certain nonprofit entities,
commonly called ``reimbursing'' employers. The other requirement is found in 5 U.S.C. 8502(b) and pertains to payment
of UCX and UCFE. As noted in item 1.f, above, the term ``compensation'' is considered to include SEA allowances. Therefore,
individuals who perform services covered under these two additional ``equal treatment'' provisions must be given
the option of receiving SEA allowances. The payment of SEA allowances does not require an amendment to the UCFE/UCX
agreement.
