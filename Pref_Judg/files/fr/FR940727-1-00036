If EPA concludes, after considering data from the public comment on this proposal, that the risk from mercury release
from mercury-containing lamps is not significant enough to warrant Subtitle C regulation, the Agency may choose
to finalize a conditional exclusion. However, if EPA concludes, after considering data received in public comment
that the risk from mercury release from lamps is significant, the Agency may choose to keep mercury-containing lamps
in Subtitle C, under the universal waste management system.

The following sections describe the two approaches in detail.

Section 3001 of RCRA charges EPA with identifying the characteristics of hazardous waste and listing particular
hazardous wastes. Section 1004(5) of RCRA defines waste as ``hazardous'' if the waste poses a ``substantial present
or potential hazard'' to human health or the environment when improperly managed. The groundwater data discussed
earlier in this notice suggest that mercury-bearing lamps, if they are disposed of according to the conditions of
the proposed exclusion, may not pose a substantial present or future threat to human health or the environment. Based
on the Agency's authority to identify characteristics of hazardous waste and the statutory definition of hazardous
waste, EPA is considering whether an exclusion of used mercury-containing lamps from regulation as hazardous waste
would be appropriate. EPA requests comment on the data presented in the proposal, as well as on whether to exclude these
lamps from regulation as hazardous waste.

The exclusion under consideration today has two conditions. In order to qualify for the exclusion: 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(1)(a) Generators would be required to either dispose of these lamps in a municipal solid waste landfill that is permitted
by a State/Tribe with an EPA-approved MSW permitting program, or 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(b) If generators do not send these lamps to a MSW landfill, they would send them to a State permitted, licensed, or registered
mercury reclamation facility; and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(2) Generators would be required to keep a record of the lamps shipped to management facilities.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Agency is proposing to limit the exclusion to spent lamps disposed in MSW landfills (requirements of MSW landfills
are discussed later in this section), rather than allowing disposal in any nonhazardous waste landfill, because
EPA has field data on leachate (including mercury levels) only for MSW landfills (among Subtitle D facility categories).
The available information (discussed above) suggests that the amount of mercury from mercury-containing lamps
that is released from MSW landfill gas is very small and its effect on ambient air quality may not pose a significant
hazard to human health or the environment. EPA requests any information on the levels and impacts of mercury in MSW
landfill gas. Further, data on leachate quality and air emissions from other nonhazardous waste landfills, including
industrial solid waste landfills, is very limited. However, some soil column data also suggest that mercury dissolution
into soil pore water occurs at very low levels (Eichholz et al., 1986). EPA requests comment on this approach and any
information on mercury releases from other nonhazardous waste landfills. Based on EPA's existing data and any additional
data received, EPA may expand the exclusion to include disposal in non-municipal, solid waste, Subtitle D disposal
facilities. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
While this proposed exclusion from Subtitle C of RCRA is supported by data from municipal solid waste landfills with
a range of design and operating conditions, EPA believes that limiting the exclusion to spent lamps disposed only
in MSW landfills that are permitted by States or Tribes with EPA-approved MSW landfill permitting programs will provide
further assurance that human health and the environment will be protected. In particular, these MSW landfill permitting
controls will provide added protection to the management of these lamps. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In October 1991, EPA promulgated new requirements for municipal solid waste landfills (40 CFR Part 258, October 9,
1991, 56 FR 51016). These requirements cover location restrictions, landfill design and operations, groundwater
monitoring, corrective action measures, financial assurance, and conditions for closing the landfill and post
closure care. The majority of landfill owners/operators accepting greater than 100 tons per day must comply with
the majority of the requirements by October 9, 1993. On October 1, 1993 (58 FR 51536), EPA delayed the October 9, 1993
effective date for six months for landfills accepting less than 100 tons per day (in addition to other criteria) and
delayed the effective date for two years for landfills in arid or remote regions that accept less than 20 tons per day.
