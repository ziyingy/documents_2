 Amendment 6 to the FMP was prepared by the Pacific Fishery Management Council (Council) and approved and implemented
by NMFS on November 16, 1992 (57 FR 54001), through regulations codified at 50 CFR part 663, subpart C. Amendment 6,
also called the ``Limited-Entry Plan'', is intended to control the harvesting capacity of the groundfish fishing
fleet by:
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
(1) Limiting the overall number of vessels,
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(2) Limiting the number of vessels using each of the three major gear types, and
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(3) Limiting increases in vessel harvest capacity by limiting vessel length. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Section 663.34(a)(3) of the implementing regulations provides that small limited-entry fisheries that are controlled
by a local government, are in existence as of July 11, 1991, and have negligible impacts on the groundfish resource,
may be certified as consistent with the objectives of Amendment 6 and incorporated into the limited-entry fishery.
If a fleet is certified and incorporated into the limited-entry fishery, vessels in the fleet at the time of incorporation
will be issued limited-entry permits with ``A'' endorsements for the appropriate gear. A permit issued to a vessel
in a certified fleet is only valid when the vessel is operating under and in conformance with the certified program.
Such a permit and endorsement may be transferred to another vessel that will operate in the same certified fleet, provided
the total number of vessels in the fleet does not increase. If more vessels are added to a fleet in a certified limited-entry
program, these additional vessels will not receive ``A'' endorsements unless the program is recertified for the
greater number of vessels, and the larger fleet incorporated into the limited-entry fishery. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Upon application by a representative of a small limited-entry fleet, the Regional Director, after receiving a recommendation
from the Council, may incorporate the fleet into the limited-entry fishery, if the Regional Director:
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(1) Determines that the fleet has a negligible impact on the groundfish resource, and
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(2) Certifies the activities of the fleet as consistent with the objectives of Amendment 6. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

On May 27, 1993, a representative of the Newport Beach dory fishing fleet of southern California requested that the
Regional Director incorporate the small, local dory fleet of 15 vessels into the limited-entry fishery. The Newport
Beach dory fishermen's fleet was founded in 1891 and is recognized as a historical landmark by the Newport Beach Historical
Society. The City of Newport Beach, CA, has reserved an area west of the Newport Pier exclusively for the dory fleet
operations. Dory fishermen provide fresh fish each day to a market run by the dory fleet. The City of Newport Beach adopted
policy guidelines on November 23, 1987, that serve to limit the size of the fleet and the size of the vessels that belong
to the fleet. The size of the fleet is limited by the city by restricting the number of storage sheds permitted on the
beach to 19, and by limiting the number of vessels to one per shed. Currently 15 sheds are utilized by longline groundfish
fishermen; 2 sheds by net, crab, and lobster fishermen; and 2 sheds are used as offices. Any new entrant to the fleet
must buy out one of the current shed owners in order to join the fleet. Vessel size is limited to about 20 ft (6.1 m) in length
or less by the requirement that the vessels be launched and landed from the beach.

Based on its recognition by the Newport Beach Historical Society and the policy guidelines adopted November 23, 1987,
by the City of Newport Beach, the Regional Director has determined that the Newport Beach dory fleet is ``controlled
by a local government,'' and was ``in existence as of July 11, 1991.'' The Regional Director also concluded that the
fleet has unique cultural and social importance and is dependent on the Pacific groundfish fishery.
