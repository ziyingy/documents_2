SUMMARY:
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
 We are advising the public of our determination that a genetically engineered, virus resistant yellow crookneck
squash line designated ZW&hyph;20 squash is no longer considered a regulated article under our regulations governing
the introduction of certain genetically engineered organisms. Our determination is based on our evaluation of data
submitted by the Upjohn Company in its petition for a determination of the regulatory status of ZW&hyph;20 squash,
an analysis of other scientific data, and our review of comments received from the public regarding the Upjohn petition.
This notice also announces the availability of the written determination document and its associated environmental
assessment and finding of no significant impact.

Background

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
On July 13, 1992, the Animal and Plant Health Inspection Service (APHIS) received a petition from the Upjohn Company
(Upjohn) and its subsidiary, Asgrow Seed Company, of Kalamazoo, MI, seeking a determination that the ZW&hyph;20
virus resistant squash line no longer be considered a regulated article under APHIS' regulations in 7 CFR part 340.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
On September 4, 1992, APHIS announced the receipt of the Upjohn petition in the 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 -->
Federal Register
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 (57 FR 40632&hyph;40633, Docket No. 92&hyph;127&hyph;1) and announced its intent to issue an interpretive ruling
that the ZW&hyph;20 virus resistant squash does not present a plant pest risk and, therefore, would no longer be considered
a regulated article. That notice also requested comments on APHIS' proposed interpretive ruling. After considering
the 17 comments submitted during the 45-day comment period, of which 7 were in support of the petition and 10 in opposition,
APHIS determined that it was in the public interest to reopen the comment period to seek additional comment on several
scientific and technical issues raised by the commenters. The commenters expressed concerns in three major areas:
(1) Will the introduction of the two viral coat protein genes increase the likelihood of the creation of new plant viruses;
(2) could the introduction of two virus resistance genes cause squash to become a weed; and (3) would the virus resistance
genes move to wild squash relatives and would this have a detrimental impact on these wild plants? A notice was published
in the 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 -->
Federal Register
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 on March 22, 1993 (58 FR 15323, Docket No. 92&hyph;127&hyph;2), to reopen the comment period for an additional 60 days.
Twelve comments were received, of which 10 were in support and 2 were in opposition. The same major areas of concern
expressed during the first comment period were again reflected in the two comments in opposition to the petition,
with the addition of a statement that an environmental impact statement should be prepared in connection with commercial
scale growth of the ZW&hyph;20 squash.

Since the date of the original submission of Upjohn's petition, APHIS has formalized, under a ``Petition for Determination
of Nonregulated Status'' (

the original petition for the ZW&hyph;20 squash was submitted.

(EA) and preliminary finding of no significant impact (FONSI) related to the proposed determination of nonregulated
status for the ZW&hyph;20 squash, a public meeting in Washington, DC, on July 21, 1994, and a 45-day comment period
ending July 7, 1994. The notice included the text of the preliminary FONSI that had been prepared by APHIS.
