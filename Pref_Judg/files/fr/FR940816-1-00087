(D) To relocate wolves that have moved outside the experimental population area back into the experimental population
area;
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(E) To aid or euthanize sick, injured, or orphaned wolves;
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(F) To salvage a dead specimen which may be used for scientific study; or
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(G) To aid in law enforcement investigations involving wolves.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(xii) Any taking pursuant to this section must be reported immediately (within 24 hours) to the appropriate Service
or Service-designated agency, which will determine the disposition of any live or dead specimens.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(3) Human access to areas with facilities where wolves are confined may be restricted at the discretion of Federal,
State, and Tribal land management agencies. When 5 or fewer breeding pairs are in an experimental population area,
land-use restrictions may also be employed on an as-needed basis, at the discretion of Federal land management and
natural resources agencies to control intrusive human disturbance around active wolf den sites. Such temporary
restrictions on human access, when 5 or fewer breeding pairs are established in an experimental population area,
may be required between April 1 and June 30, within 1 mile of active wolf den or rendezvous sites. When 6 or more breeding
pairs are established in an experimental population area, no land use restrictions may be employed outside of National
Parks or National Wildlife Refuges.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(4) No person shall possess, sell, deliver, carry, transport, ship, import, or export by any means whatsoever, any
wolf or part thereof from the experimental populations taken in violation of these regulations or in violation of
applicable State or Tribal fish and wildlife laws or regulations or the Endangered Species Act.

(5) It is unlawful for any person to attempt to commit, solicit another to commit, or cause to be committed, any offense
defined in paragraphs (&blank;)(2) through (4) of this section.

(6) The site for reintroduction is within the historic range of the species:

(i) [Reserved]
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

(ii) The central Idaho Management area is shown on the attached map. The boundaries of the nonessential experimental
population area will be those portions of Idaho and Montana that are south of Interstate Highway 90 and West of Interstate
Highway 15.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(iii) All wolves found in the wild within the boundaries of this paragraph (&blank;)(6) after the first releases will
be considered nonessential experimental animals. In the conterminous United States, a wolf that is outside an experimental
area (as defined in paragraph (&blank;)(6) of this section) would be considered as endangered (or threatened if in
Minnesota) unless it is marked or otherwise known to be an experimental animal; such a wolf may be captured for examination
and genetic testing by the Service or Service-designated agency. Disposition of the captured animal may take any
of the following courses:
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(A) If the animal was not involved in conflicts with humans and is determined likely to be an experimental wolf, it will
be returned to the reintroduction area.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(B) If the animal is determined likely to be an experimental wolf and was involved in conflicts with humans as identified
in the management plan for the closest experimental area it may relocated, placed in captivity, or killed.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(C) If the animal is determined not likely to be an experimental animal, it will be managed according to any Service
approved plans for that area or will be marked and released near its point of capture.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(D) If the animal is determined not to be a wild grey wolf or if the Service or agencies designated by the Service determine
the animal shows substantial evidence of recent hybridization with other canids such as domestic dogs or coyotes
or of being an animal raised in captivity, it will be returned to captivity or killed.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(7) The reintroduced wolves will be continually monitored during the life of the project, including by the use of radio
telemetry and other remote sensing devices as appropriate. All released animals will be vaccinated against diseases
and parasites prevalent in canids, as appropriate, prior to release and during subsequent handling. Any animal that
is sick, injured, or otherwise in need of special care may be captured by authorized personnel of the Service or Service
designated agencies and given appropriate care. Such an animal will be released back into its respective reintroduction
area as soon as possible, unless physical or behavioral problems make it necessary to return the animal to captivity
or euthanize it.
