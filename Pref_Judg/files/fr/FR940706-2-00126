<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Pursuant to Public Law 97-415, the U.S. Nuclear Regulatory Commission (the Commission or NRC staff) is publishing
this regular biweekly notice. Public Law 97-415 revised section 189 of the Atomic Energy Act of 1954, as amended (the
Act), to require the Commission to publish notice of any amendments issued, or proposed to be issued, under a new provision
of section 189 of the Act. This provision grants the Commission the authority to issue and make immediately effective
any amendment to an operating license upon a determination by the Commission that such amendment involves no significant
hazards consideration, notwithstanding the pendency before the Commission of a request for a hearing from any person.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
This biweekly notice includes all notices of amendments issued, or proposed to be issued from June 13, 1994, through
June 23, 1994. The last biweekly notice was published on June 22, 1994 (59 FR 32226).

Notice Of Consideration Of Issuance Of Amendments To Facility Operating Licenses, Proposed No Significant Hazards
Consideration Determination, And Opportunity For A Hearing
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The Commission has made a proposed determination that the following amendment requests involve no significant hazards
consideration. Under the Commission's regulations in 10 CFR 50.92, this means that operation of the facility in accordance
with the proposed amendment would not (1) involve a significant increase in the probability or consequences of an
accident previously evaluated; or (2) create the possibility of a new or different kind of accident from any accident
previously evaluated; or (3) involve a significant reduction in a margin of safety. The basis for this proposed determination
for each amendment request is shown below. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Commission is seeking public comments on this proposed determination. Any comments received within 30 days after
the date of publication of this notice will be considered in making any final determination. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Normally, the Commission will not issue the amendment until the expiration of the 30-day notice period. However,
should circumstances change during the notice period such that failure to act in a timely way would result, for example,
in derating or shutdown of the facility, the Commission may issue the license amendment before the expiration of the
30-day notice period, provided that its final determination is that the amendment involves no significant hazards
consideration. The final determination will consider all public and State comments received before action is taken.
Should the Commission take this action, it will publish in the 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 -->
Federal Register 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
a notice of issuance and provide for opportunity for a hearing after issuance. The Commission expects that the need
to take this action will occur very infrequently. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Written comments may be submitted by mail to the Rules Review and Directives Branch, Division of Freedom of Information
and Publications Services, Office of Administration, U.S. Nuclear Regulatory Commission, Washington, DC 20555,
and should cite the publication date and page number of this 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
notice. Written comments may also be delivered to Room 6D22, Two White Flint North, 11555 Rockville Pike, Rockville,
Maryland from 7:30 a.m. to 4:15 p.m. Federal workdays. Copies of written comments received may be examined at the NRC
Public Document Room, the Gelman Building, 2120 L Street, NW., Washington, DC 20555. The filing of requests for a hearing
and petitions for leave to intervene is discussed below.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
By August 5, 1994, the licensee may file a request for a hearing with respect to issuance of the amendment to the subject
facility operating license and any person whose interest may be affected by this proceeding and who wishes to participate
as a party in the proceeding must file a written request for a hearing and a petition for leave to intervene. Requests
for a hearing and a petition for leave to intervene shall be filed in accordance with the Commission's ``Rules of Practice
for Domestic Licensing Proceedings'' in 10 CFR Part 2. Interested persons should consult a current copy of 10 CFR 2.714
which is available at the Commission's Public Document Room, the Gelman Building, 2120 L Street, NW., Washington,
DC 20555 and at the local public document room for the particular facility involved. If a request for a hearing or petition
for leave to intervene is filed by the above date, the Commission or an Atomic Safety and Licensing Board, designated
by the Commission or by the Chairman of the Atomic Safety and Licensing Board Panel, will rule on the request and/or
petition; and the Secretary or the designated Atomic Safety and Licensing Board will issue a notice of a hearing or
an appropriate order. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
As required by 10 CFR 2.714, a petition for leave to intervene shall set forth with particularity the interest of the
petitioner in the proceeding, and how that interest may be affected by the results of the proceeding. The petition
should specifically explain the reasons why intervention should be permitted with particular reference to the following
factors: (1) the nature of the petitioner's right under the Act to be made a party to the proceeding; (2) the nature and
extent of the petitioner's property, financial, or other interest in the proceeding; and (3) the possible effect
of any order which may be entered in the proceeding on the petitioner's interest. The petition should also identify
the specific aspect(s) of the subject matter of the proceeding as to which petitioner wishes to intervene. Any person
who has filed a petition for leave to intervene or who has been admitted as a party may amend the petition without requesting
leave of the Board up to 15 days prior to the first prehearing conference scheduled in the proceeding, but such an amended
petition must satisfy the specificity requirements described above.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Not later than 15 days prior to the first prehearing conference scheduled in the proceeding, a petitioner shall file
a supplement to the petition to intervene which must include a list of the contentions which are sought to be litigated
in the matter. Each contention must consist of a specific statement of the issue of law or fact to be raised or controverted.
In addition, the petitioner shall provide a brief explanation of the bases of the contention and a concise statement
of the alleged facts or expert opinion which support the contention and on which the petitioner intends to rely in proving
the contention at the hearing. The petitioner must also provide references to those specific sources and documents
of which the petitioner is aware and on which the petitioner intends to rely to establish those facts or expert opinion.
Petitioner must provide sufficient information to show that a genuine dispute exists with the applicant on a material
issue of law or fact. Contentions shall be limited to matters within the scope of the amendment under consideration.
The contention must be one which, if proven, would entitle the petitioner to relief. A petitioner who fails to file
such a supplement which satisfies these requirements with respect to at least one contention will not be permitted
to participate as a party. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Those permitted to intervene become parties to the proceeding, subject to any limitations in the order granting leave
to intervene, and have the opportunity to participate fully in the conduct of the hearing, including the opportunity
to present evidence and cross-examine witnesses. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
If a hearing is requested, the Commission will make a final determination on the issue of no significant hazards consideration.
The final determination will serve to decide when the hearing is held. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
If the final determination is that the amendment request involves no significant hazards consideration, the Commission
may issue the amendment and make it immediately effective, notwithstanding the request for a hearing. Any hearing
held would take place after issuance of the amendment. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
If the final determination is that the amendment request involves a significant hazards consideration, any hearing
held would take place before the issuance of any amendment. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
A request for a hearing or a petition for leave to intervene must be filed with the Secretary of the Commission, U.S.
Nuclear Regulatory Commission, Washington, DC 20555, Attention: Docketing and Services Branch, or may be delivered
to the Commission's Public Document Room, the Gelman Building, 2120 L Street, NW., Washington DC 20555, by the above
date. Where petitions are filed during the last 10 days of the notice period, it is requested that the petitioner promptly
so inform the Commission by a toll-free telephone call to Western Union at 1-(800) 248-5100 (in Missouri 1-(800) 342-6700).
The Western Union operator should be given Datagram Identification Number N1023 and the following message addressed
to John N. Hannon: petitioner's name and telephone number, date petition was mailed, plant name, and publication
date and page number of this 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
notice. A copy of the petition should also be sent to the Office of the General Counsel, U.S. Nuclear Regulatory Commission,
Washington, DC 20555, and to the attorney for the licensee. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Nontimely filings of petitions for leave to intervene, amended petitions, supplemental petitions and/or requests
for a hearing will not be entertained absent a determination by the Commission, the presiding officer or the Atomic
Safety and Licensing Board that the petition and/or request should be granted based upon a balancing of factors specified
in 10 CFR 2.714(a)(1)(i)-(v) and 2.714(d). 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
For further details with respect to this action, see the application for amendment which is available for public inspection
at the Commission's Public Document Room, the Gelman Building, 2120 L Street, NW., Washington, DC 20555, and at the

Description of amendment request: 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The proposed amendment would merge Toledo Edison Company into Cleveland Electric Illuminating Company. As described
in the application, the company formed from the merger is intended to be renamed. Therefore, the licensee uses the
nomenclature ``NEWCO'' as a temporary name of the combined operating company, and will provide the permanent name
by supplemental letter. The amendment would (1) replace the Toledo Edison Company and Cleveland Electric Illuminating
Company with ``NEWCO'' as a licensee, (2) designate ``NEWCO'' as the owner of the Perry Nuclear Power Plant, Unit 1,
and (3) make other administrative changes to the license as indicated in the amendment application. Centerior Service
Company would be unaffected by the amendment and would remain a licensee.

Basis for proposed no significant hazards consideration determination: 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
As required by 10 CFR 50.91(a), the licensee has provided its analysis of the issue of no significant hazards consideration,
which is presented below:
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->
A. The proposed changes do not involve a significant increase in the probability or consequences of an accident previously
evaluated. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The supporting qualification report for the subject criteria demonstrates that the presence of the tubesheet will
enhance the tube integrity in the region of the tube-to-tubesheet roll expansions by precluding tube deformation
beyond its initial expanded outside diameter. The resistance to a tube rupture is strengthened by the presence of
the tubesheet in that region. The results of hardrolling of the tube into the tubesheet provides a mechanical leak
limiting seal between the tube and the tubesheet. A tube rupture cannot occur because the contact between the tube
and the tubesheet does not permit sufficient movement of tube material. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The type of degradation for which the F
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=5 f=1 -->
*
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->
 criteria has been developed (cracking with a circumferential orientation) can theoretically lead to a postulated
tube rupture event provided that the postulated through-wall circumferential crack exists near the top of the tubesheet.
An evaluation including analysis and testing has been done to determine the resistive strength of the expanded tubes
within the tubesheet. This evaluation provides the basis for the acceptance criteria for tube degradation subject
to the F
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=5 f=1 -->
*
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->
 criteria. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The F
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=5 f=1 -->
*
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->
 length of roll expansion is sufficient to preclude tube pullout from tube degradation located below the F
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=5 f=1 -->
*
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->
 distance, regardless of the extent of the tube degradation. The Technical Specification leakage rate requirements
and accident analysis assumptions remain unchanged in the unlikely event that significant leakage from this region
does occur. The tube rupture and pullout is fully bounded by the existing steam generator tube rupture analysis included
in the UFSAR. The leakage testing of the roll expanded tubes indicates that for tube expansion lengths approximately
equal to the F
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=5 f=1 -->
*
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->
 distance, any postulated primary to secondary leakage from F
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=5 f=1 -->
*
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->
 tubes would be insignificant. The proposed alternate repair criteria does not adversely impact any other previously
evaluated design basis accident. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The leakage from an F
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=5 f=1 -->
*
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->
 tube would be limited by the tube-to-tubesheet interface since this leak would occur below the secondary face of the
tubesheet. Qualification testing and previous experience indicate that normal and faulted leakage is well below
Technical Specification and administrative limits creating no increase in the consequences associated with tube
rupture type leakages. The UFSAR analyzed accident scenarios are still bounding since the normal and faulted leak
rates are well within the normal operating limit of 150 gallons per day. This conclusion is consistent with previous
F
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=5 f=1 -->
*
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->
 programs approved and used at other operating plants. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
All of the design and operating characteristics of the steam generator and connected systems are preserved since
the F
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=5 f=1 -->
*
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->
 criteria utilizes the ``as rolled'' tube configuration that exists as part of the original steam generator design.
The F
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=5 f=1 -->
*
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->
 joint has been analyzed and tested for design, operating, and faulted condition loadings in accordance with Regulatory
Guide 1.121 safety factors. The potential for tube rupture is not increased from the original submittal as demonstrated
in the qualification analyses and testing completed in the BWNT report. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Therefore, this change does not involve a significant increase in the probability or consequences of an accident
previously evaluated. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
B. The proposed changes do not create the possibility of a new or different type of accident from any accident previously
evaluated. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Implementation of the proposed F
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=5 f=1 -->
*
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->
 criteria does not introduce any significant changes to the plant design basis. Use of the criteria does not provide
a mechanism to initiate an accident outside of the region of the expanded portion of the tube. In the unlikely event
the failed tube severed completely at a point below the F
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=5 f=1 -->
*
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->
 region, the remaining F
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=5 f=1 -->
*
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->
 joint would retain engagement in the tubesheet due to its length of expanded contact within the tubesheet bore. This
engagement length would prevent any interaction of the severed tube with neighboring tubes. Any hypothetical accident
as a result of any tube degradation in the expanded region of the tube would be bounded by the existing tube rupture accident
analysis. Tube bundle structural integrity will be maintained. Tube bundle leak tightness will be maintained such
that any postulated accident leakage from F
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=5 f=1 -->
*
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->
 tubes will be negligible with regard to offsite doses. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Therefore, there is not a potential for creating the possibility of a new or different type of accident from any accident
previously evaluated. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
C. The proposed changes do not involve a significant reduction in a margin of safety. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The use of the F
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=5 f=1 -->
*
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->
 criteria has been demonstrated to maintain the integrity of the tube bundle commensurate with the requirements of
Reg Guide 1.121 and the primary to secondary pressure boundary under normal and postulated accident conditions.
Acceptable tube degradation for the F
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=5 f=1 -->
*
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->
 criteria is any degradation indication in the tubesheet region, more than the F
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=5 f=1 -->
*
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->
 distance from the secondary face of the tubesheet or the top of the last hardroll contact point which ever is further
into the tubesheet. The safety factors used in the verification of the strength of the degraded tube are consistent
with the safety factors in the ASME Boiler and Pressure Vessel Code and Reg Guide 1.121 used in steam generator design.
The F
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=5 f=1 -->
*
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->
 distance has been verified by various testing to be greater than the length of the roll expanded tube-to-tubesheet
interface required to preclude both tube pullout and significant leakage during normal and postulated accident
conditions. The protective boundaries of the steam generator continue to be maintained with the use of the F

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=5 f=1 -->

 criteria. A tube with the indication of degration previously requiring removal from service can be kept in service
through the F
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=5 f=1 -->
*
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->
 criteria. Since the joint is constrained within the tubesheet bore, there is no additional risk associated with the
previously analyzed tube rupture event. The leak testing acceptance criteria are based on the primary to secondary
leakage limit in the Technical Specifications and the leakage assumptions used in the UFSAR accident analyses. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Implementation of the alternate repair criteria will decrease the number of tubes which must be taken out of service
with tube plugs or repaired by sleeves. Both plugs and sleeves reduce the RCS flow margin; thus, implementation of
the F

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=5 f=1 -->
*
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->
 criteria will maintain the margin of flow that would otherwise be reduced in the event of increased plugging or sleeving.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Based on the above, it is concluded that the proposed change does not result in a significant reduction in margin with
respect to plant safety as defined in the UFSAR or the Technical Specification Bases.

Description of amendment request: 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The proposed amendment would modify the Reactor Trip System (RTS) and Engineered Safety Feature (ESF) instrumentation
surveillance requirements to incorporate the applicable changes specified in NRC-approved WCAP-10271 and related
supplements. Four specific changes were approved by the Nuclear Regulatory Commission for the RTS and Engineered
Safety Feature Actuation System analog channels. These changes are limited to the specific Reactor Protection System
(RPS) channels evaluated in the WCAP (including all supplements) and are subject to the conditions specified by the
NRC.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
1. The surveillance or test frequency may be changed from monthly to quarterly.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
2. The time allowed for a channel to be inoperable or out of service in an untripped condition may be changed from 1 hour
to 6 hours.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
3. The time a channel in a functional group may be bypassed to perform testing may be increased from 2 to 4 hours. This
bypass time applies to either an inoperable channel when testing is done in the tripped mode or
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
 to the channel in test when testing is done in the bypass mode. The Allowed Outage Time for maintenance of a channel is
12 hours.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
4. Routine channel testing may be performed in the bypassed condition instead of the tripped condition.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In addition, a number of editorial changes are made to improve clarity, and two-loop operating requirements are proposed
to be deleted. Also, the surveillance test interval for RTS interlocks is proposed to be changed from monthly to once-per-refueling
(about 18 months). Although not part of WCAP-10271, this was previously approved generically by NRC.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Basis for proposed no significant hazards consideration determination: 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
As required by 10 CFR 50.91(a), the licensee has provided its analysis of the issue of no significant hazards consideration,
which is presented below:
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->
1. Does the change involve a significant increase in the probability or consequences of an accident previously evaluated?
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The determination that the results of the proposed changes are within all acceptable criteria was established in
the SER(s) [Safety Evaluation Report(s)] prepared for WCAP-10271, WCAP-10271 Supplement 1, WCAP-10271 Supplement
2 and WCAP-10271 Supplement 2, Revision 1 issued by letters dated February 21, 1985, February 22, 1989 and April 30,
1990. Implementation of the proposed changes is expected to result in an acceptable increase in total Reactor Protection
System yearly unavailability. This increase, which is primarily due to less frequent surveillance, results in an
increase of similar magnitude in the probability of an Anticipated Transient Without Scram (ATWS) and in the probability
of core melt resulting from an ATWS and also results in a small increase in Core Damage Frequency (CDF) due to Engineered
Safety Features Actuation System unavailability.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Implementation of the proposed changes is expected to result in a significant reduction in the probability of core
melt from inadvertent reactor trips. This is a result of a reduction in the number of inadvertent reactor trips (0.5
fewer inadvertent reactor trips per unit per year) occurring during testing of RPS instrumentation. This reduction
is primarily attributable to testing in bypass and less frequent surveillance.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The reduction in [***] core melt frequency is sufficiently large to counter the increase in ATWS core melt probability
resulting in an overall reduction in total core melt probability.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The values determined by the WOG [Westinghouse Owners Group] and presented in the WCAP for the increase in CDF were
verified by Brookhaven National Laboratory (BNL) as part of an audit and sensitivity analyses for the NRC Staff. Based
on the small value of the increase compared to the range of uncertainty in the CDF, the increase is considered acceptable.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Changes to Surveillance Test Frequencies for the Reactor Trip System Interlocks do not represent a significant reduction
in testing. The currently specified test interval for interlock channels allows the surveillance requirement to
be satisfied by verifying that the permissive logic is in its required state using the annunciator status light. The
surveillance, as currently required, only verifies the status of the permissive logic and does not address verification
of channel setpoint or operability. The setpoint verification and channel operability are verified after a refueling
shutdown. The definition of the channel check includes comparison of the channel status with other channels for the
same parameter. The requirement to routinely verify permissive status is a different consideration than the availability
of trip or actuation channels which are required to change state on the occurrence of an event and for which the function
availability is more dependent on the surveillance interval. The change in surveillance requirement to at least
once every 18 months does not therefore represent a significant change in channel surveillance and does not involve
a significant increase in unavailability of the Reactor Protection System.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The proposed changes do not result in an increase in the severity or consequences of an accident previously evaluated.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Implementation of the proposed changes affects the probability of failure of the RPS but does not alter the manner
in which protection is afforded nor the manner in which limiting criteria are established.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Therefore, the proposed changes do not involve a significant increase in the probability or consequences of an accident
previously evaluated.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
2. Does the change create the possibility of a new or different kind of accident from any accident previously evaluated?
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The proposed changes do not result in a change in the manner in which the Reactor Protection System provides plant protection.
No change is being made which alters the functioning of the Reactor Protection System (other than in a test mode). Rather
the likelihood or probability of the Reactor Protection System functioning properly is affected as described above.
Therefore,the proposed changes do not create the possibility of a new or different kind of accident nor involve a reduction
in a margin of safety as defined in the Safety Analysis Report.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The proposed changes do not involve hardware changes except those necessary to implement testing in bypass. Some
existing instrumentation is designed to be tested in bypass and current technical specifications allow testing
in bypass. Testing in bypass is also recognized by IEEE [Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers] Standards.
Therefore, testing in bypass has been previously approved and implementation of the proposed change for testing
in bypass does not create the possibility of a new or different kind of accident from any previously evaluated. Furthermore,
since the other proposed changes do not alter the functioning of the RPS, the possibility of a new or different kind
of accident from any previously evaluated has not been created.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
3. Does the change involve a significant reduction in a margin of safety?
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The proposed changes do not alter the manner in which safety limits, limiting safety system setpoints or limiting
conditions for operation are determined. The impact of reduced testing other than as addressed above is to allow a
longer time interval over which instrument uncertainties (e.g., drift) may act. Experience has shown that the initial
uncertainty assumptions are valid for reduced testing. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Implementation of the proposed changes is expected to result in an overall improvement in safety by:
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
a. Less frequent testing will result in fewer inadvertent reactor trips and fewer actuations of Engineered Safety
Feature Actuation System components.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
b. Improvements in the effectiveness of the operating staff in monitoring and controlling plant operation. This
is due to less frequent distraction of the operator and shift supervisor to attend to instrumentation testing.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Therefore, the proposed changes do not involve a significant reduction in a margin of safety.

Description of amendment request: 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The proposed amendment would modify Specifications 3.4.9.3 and 3.4.11 to incorporate power operated relief valve
(PORV) Technical Specification (TS) changes in accordance with the guidance in Generic Letter 90-06 as implemented
in NUREG-1431 Improved Standard Technical Specifications (ISTS), with some exceptions and modifications to reflect
plant specific design features. Certain other TS sections would also be modified to address related TSs.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The proposed changes involve the details of (a) limiting conditions of operation, and (b) surveillance testing for
equipment needed to protect the reactor vessel from overpressure conditions. This equipment includes PORVs and
their associated block valves, charging pumps, reactor coolant system (RCS) vent, accumulators, and the overpressure
protection system. Numerous administrative changes are also proposed, such as renumbering sections, spelling
out mathematical symbols, changes in nomenclature for consistency, and relocating sentences and paragraphs.

Basis for proposed no significant hazards consideration determination:

As required by 10 CFR 50.91(a), the licensee has provided its analysis of the issue of no significant hazards consideration,
which is presented below:
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->
1. Does the change involve a significant increase in the probability or consequences of an accident previously evaluated?
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The proposed changes consolidate the power operated relief valve requirements into Specifications 3.4.9.3 and
3.4.11 which generally adopt the new Improved Standard Technical Specifications of NUREG-1431 to address the concerns
identified in Generic Letter 90-06 except for those changes required to reflect plant specific design features.
These changes are proposed to enhance safety and improve the reliability of the PORVs and block valves. Since the proposed
changes augment or preserve the requirements contained in the current technical specifications, we have concluded
that these changes do not involve a significant increase in the probability or consequences of an accident previously
evaluated in the UFSAR [Updated Final Safety Analysis Report].
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
2. Does the change create the possibility of a new or different kind of accident from any accident previously evaluated?
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The proposed changes do not involve any physical changes to the PORVs or their setpoints. These changes do not delete
any function previously provided by the PORVs nor has the probability of inadvertent opening been increased. Accordingly,
no new failure modes have been defined for any plant system or component important to safety nor has any new limiting
single failure been identified as a result of these changes. Therefore, these changes will not create the possibility
of a new or different kind of accident from any accident previously evaluated in the UFSAR.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
3. Does the change involve a significant reduction in a margin of safety?
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The proposed changes have been incorporated to enhance safety and improve the reliability of the PORVs and block valves
to ensure their availability when called upon to perform their function. These changes do not affect the manner by
which the facility is operated or involve a change to equipment or features which affect the operational characteristics
of the facility. Therefore, operation of the facility in accordance with the proposed amendment would not involve
a significant reduction in a margin of safety.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The NRC staff has reviewed the licensee's analysis. The staff notes that a significant effort has been made by the NRC
and by industry over the last several years to improve and tighten the TS requirements for overpressure protection
systems. These efforts are documented in Generic Letter 90-06 and NUREG-1431. The changes proposed by the licensee
appear to result in TSs that are significantly more comprehensive and restrictive than those now existing for Beaver
Valley Units 1 and 2, and, therefore, should help to reduce the probability of an accident. The staff disagrees with
the licensee's claim that the changes do not affect the manner by which the facility is operated (consideration number
3 above). However, the staff believes that the proposed TS changes require more restrictive operation (such as more
careful control of the number of charging pumps which can inject into the RCS) and do not involve a significant reduction
in a margin of safety. Based on the NRC staff's review, it appears that the three standards of 10 CFR 50.92(c) are satisfied.
Therefore, the NRC staff proposes to determine that the amendment request involves no significant hazards consideration.

As required by 10 CFR 50.91(a), the licensee has provided its analysis of the issue of no significant hazards consideration,
which is presented below:
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->
1. Does the change involve a significant increase in the probability or consequences of an accident previously evaluated?
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The proposed change does not involve a significant increase in the probability or consequences of an accident previously
evaluated since the diesel generator availability and reliability is not being changed. The quantitative acceptance
criteria for new fuel oil is not being changed. Diesel generator performance will therefore not be changed due to the
proposed revision to SR [surveillance requirement] 4.8.1[.1].2.d.1.d. The diesel generator will continue to provide
sufficient electrical power to ESF [engineered safety feature] systems. The ESF systems will continue to function,
as assumed in the safety analyses, to ensure that the fuel, reactor coolant system, and containment 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
design limits are not exceeded.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Therefore, this changes will not increase the probability or consequences of an accident previously evaluated due
to the continued availability and reliability of the emergency diesel power source.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
2. Does the change create the possibility of a new or different kind of accident from any accident previously evaluated?
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The proposed change does not alter the method of operating the plant. This change will continue to ensure that the addition
of new fuel oil complies with accepted standards regarding fuel oil quality. Since design requirements continue
to be met and the integrity of the reactor coolant system pressure boundary is not challenged, no new failure mode has
been created. As a result, an accident which is different than any already evaluated in the Updated Final Safety Analysis
Report will not be created due to this change.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Therefore, the proposed change does not create the possibility of a new or different kind of accident from any accident
previously evaluated.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
3. Does the change involve a significant reduction in a margin of safety?
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The margin of safety is not reduced because the emergency diesel generators will continue to provide sufficient capacity,
capability, redundancy, and reliability to ensure availability of necessary power to ESF systems. The ESF systems
will continue to function, as assumed in the safety analyses, to ensure that the fuel, reactor coolant systems, and
containment design limits are not exceeded. The replacement of the clear and bright qualitative examination with
the proposed quantitative test to determine the actual water/sediment and particulates will ensure that new fuel
oil meets the required limits for these properties prior to addition to the storage tank, therefore assuring that
the quality of the stored fuel is unaffected by the addition of new fuel.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Therefore, this proposed change does not involve a significant reduction in a margin of safety.

this technical specification is related to environmental impact and has no impact on the margin of safety, accident
analysis, or other design basis impacting the margin of safety. No increase in adverse environmental impact has been
identified over that previously identified in the Final Environmental Statement - Operating License Stage, environmental
impact appraisals, or in any decisions of the Atomic Safety and Licensing Board. The Final Environmental Statement
concluded, based on a model of combined drift from Units 1 and 2, that no adverse impacts to sensitive species of natural
vegetation or to sensitive species of crops were expected. The staff also examined infrared aerial photographs taken
from 1975 through 1983 and found no injury to vegetation from cooling tower drift in the vicinity of Unit 1.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Continued terrestrial monitoring was performed for Beaver Valley Unit 2 by infrared aerial photography in 1986,
1988, 1990, and 1992. The results as provided in the Annual Environmental Reports Non-Radiological concluded, ``Based
on interpretation of the infrared photographs and field verification, there is no evidence to suggest that the BVPS
[Beaver Valley Power Station] cooling towers are causing vegetation stress.''
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Based on the compilation of the infrared aerial photography performed for both BV-1 and BV-2, deletion of this terrestrial
monitoring requirement will have no impact on the environment or the operation of the plant. Therefore, the proposed
change will not involve a significant increase in the probability or consequences of an accident previously evaluated.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
2. Does the change create the possibility of a new or different kind of accident from any accident previously evaluated?
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Appendix B Section 4.2.2 requirement to perform infrared aerial photography reflects a commitment described
in Final Environmental Statement Section 5.14.1. Therein it is stated that the preoperational monitoring studies
for BV-2 are based primarily on the BV-1 operational monitoring programs. ``Results of these studies have shown that
there were no BV-1 operational impacts on flora, thus, the only terrestrial monitoring planned for BV-2 is continued
infrared aerial photography every other year. The photographs will be compared with preoperational photographs
of the BV-2 area, nd any signs of injury as a result of salt drift and other sources will be checked. The details of this
terrestrial monitoring program will be specified in the Environmental Protection Plan that will be included in Appendix
B of the operating license.'' The subject of this concern is the impact of salt and water drift on area vegetation including
sensitive agricultural crops. From the standpoint of soil salinization (the effects of the accumulation of salts
in the soil), described in the Environmental Report-Operating License Stage Section 5.3.3, no appreciable impact
resulting from operation of the natural draft cooling towers is anticipated. This is based on the average rate of precipitation
of 36.2 inches annually which greatly reduces the potential for accumulation of salt in the soil. The terrestrial
monitoring program has been performed in accordance with the Environmental Protection Plan and has provided additional
verification that operation of both cooling towers has not produced any evidence of vegetation stress. The proposed
change does not introduce any new mode of plant operation or require any physical modification to the plant, therefore,
this change will not create the possibility of a new or different kind of accident from any accident previously evaluated.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
3. Does the change involve a significant reduction in a margin of safety?
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Infrared aerial photography surveillance does not affect safety systems and/or systems important to safety. Terrestrial
monitoring is not used in any accident analysis and does not provide a basis for evaluating the radiological consequences
of an accident. Deleting the requirement to perform infrared aerial photography will not result in any environmental
impact from operation of the cooling tower and will not affect the operation of the cooling tower. The operating history
of both the BV-1 and the BV-2 cooling towers has demonstrated that there is no evidence of vegetation stress in accordance
with the results obtained from the infrared aerial photography and other associated methods of environmental monitoring.
Therefore, based on the above, the proposed change will not involve a significant reduction in a margin of safety.

Description of amendment request: 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The amendment will revise Technical Specification (TS) 3.5.2 for Emergency Core Cooling Systems (ECCS) by removing
the option that allows High Pressure Safety Injection (HPSI) Pump 1C to be used as an alternative to the preferred pump
for subsystem operability. HPSI pump 1C is an installed spare which is not required to be maintained in an operable
status, and this change is being requested to upgrade the ECCS operability requirements consistent with actual plant
operating needs.

Basis for proposed no significant hazards consideration determination: 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
As required by 10 CFR 50.91(a), the licensee has provided its analysis of the issue of no significant hazards consideration,
which is presented below:
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->
(1) Operation of the facility in accordance with the proposed amendment would not involve a significant increase
in the probability or consequences of an accident previously evaluated.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The proposed license amendment will remove the option of using High Pressure Safety Injection Pump 1C (HPSI-1C) to
satisfy, in part, the Emergency Core Cooling System (ECCS) operabilityrequirements specified in Limiting Condition
for Operation (LCO) 3.5.2. HPSI-1C is an installed spare pump that is not required to be operable unless it is being
used in place of the preferred B-train ECCS high pressure pump. The required functional response of the ECCS or the
required availability of the minimum equipment necessary to accomplish the ECCS safety function will not be changed
by removing the spare pump option from the Technical Specifications.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The calculated cooling performance of the St. Lucie Unit 1 ECCS during postulated accidents conforms to the criteria
set forth in 10 CFR 50.46 and the ability to achieve this required performance, including considerations of single-failure
criteria, is independent from optional use of HPSI-1C. Therefore, operation of the facility in accordance with the
proposed amendment will not involve a significant increase in the probability or consequences of an accident previously
evaluated.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(2) Operation of the facility in accordance with the proposed amendment would not create the possibility of a new or
different kind of accident from any accident previously evaluated.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The proposed amendment will not change the physical plant or the modes of operation defined in the facility license.
Eliminating the option for the licensee to utilize HPSI-1C in place of the preferred B-train ECCS high pressure pump
does not involve the addition of new or different types of equipment to the previously analyzed ECCS. Equipment important
to safety will continue to perform their safety functions as previously analyzed and will not be affected by this proposed
amendment. Therefore, operation of the facility in accordance with the proposed amendment would not create the possibility
of a new or different kind of accident from any accident previously evaluated.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(3) Operation of the facility in accordance with the proposed amendment would not involve a significant reduction
in a margin of safety.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Removing the option to employ the installed spare HPSI pump 1C in lieu of the preferred B-train pump to determine ECCS
operability only removes an operational flexibility that has rarely been used by the licensee. St. Lucie Unit 1 accident
analyses do not take credit for an installed spare pump, the minimum complement of safety injection equipment required
for safe operation of the facility and that is required by LCO 3.5.2 is not changed, and the results of plant accident
and transient analyses are not influenced by this proposed amendment. The proposed change does not alter the bases
for any Technical Specification related to the establishment of, or maintenance of, a nuclear safety margin. Therefore,
operation of the facility in accordance with the proposed amendment would not involve a significant reduction in
a margin of safety.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The proposed changes are administrative in nature in that the specifications for operation and surveillance of the
Seismic Monitoring Instrumentation system will be relocated from Appendix A of the facility operating license to
the Updated Final Safety Analysis Report for St. Lucie Unit 1 and Unit 2. Changes to the system will be controlled by
10 CFR 50.59 and the safety analysis report is required to be updated pursuant to 10 CFR 50.71(e). Relocation of these
requirements to the UFSAR is consistent with the NRC ``Final Policy Statement on Technical Specifications Improvements
for Nuclear Power Reactors'' published in the Federal Register (58 FR 39132) dated July 22, 1993. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Seismic monitoring instrumentation is not an accident initiator nor a part of the success path(s) which function
to mitigate accidents evaluated in the plant safety analyses. The proposed technical specification change does
not involve any change to the configuration or method of operation of any plant equipment that is used to mitigate the
consequences of an accident, nor do the changes alter any assumptions or conditions in any of the plant accident analyses.
Therefore, operation of the facility in accordance with the proposed amendment would not involve a significant increase
in the probability or consequences of an accident previously evaluated.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(2) Operation of the facility in accordance with the proposed amendment would not create the possibility of a new or
different kind of accident from any accident previously evaluated.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The proposed amendment to relocate the existing Technical Specification requirements for Seismic Monitoring Instrumentation
to the Updated Final Safety Analysis Report will not change the physical plant or the modes of plant operation defined
in the Facility License. The change does not involve the addition or modification of equipment nor does it alter the
design or operation of plant systems. Therefore, operation of the facility in accordance with the proposed amendment
would not create the possibility of a new or different kind of accident from any accident previously evaluated.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(3) Operation of the facility in accordance with the proposed amendment would not involve a significant reduction

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The proposed changes are administrative in nature in that operating and surveillance requirements for the Seismic
Monitoring Instrumentation system will be relocated from Appendix A of the facility license to the Updated Final
Safety Analysis Report for St. Lucie Unit 1 and Unit 2. Seismic monitoring instruments are not used to actuate safety-related
equipment, provide interlocks, or otherwise perform plant control functions. The instruments are used to record
the magnitude of a seismic event, should it occur. Conditions evaluated in plant accident and transient analyses
do not involve seismic instruments. The proposed changes do not alter the basis for any technical specification that
is related to the establishment of, or the maintenance of, a nuclear safety margin. Therefore, operation of the facility
in accordance with the proposed amendment would not involve a significant reduction in a margin of safety.

As required by 10 CFR 50.91(a), the licensee has provided its analysis of the issue of no significant hazards consideration,
which is presented below:
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->
(1)Operation of the facility in accordance with the proposed amendment would not involve a significant increase
in the probability or consequences of an accident previously evaluated.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The proposed amendment does not involve a significant increase in the probability or consequences of an accident
previously evaluated because the main steam code safety valves will continue to be tested in accordance with current
NRC requirements as implemented through 10 CFR 50.55a. The NRC specifies the ASME code requirements for a facility
through revisions to 10 CFR 50.55a and through the review and approval of the plant specific in-service testing plan
for pumps and valves at the beginning of each in-service inspection interval.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The probability or consequences of an accident are not increased because testing of the main steam safety valves is
in accordance with the appropriate NRC requirements.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(2) Use of the modified specification would not create the possibility of a new or different kind of accident from any
previously evaluated.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The use of this modified specification can not create the possibility of a new or different kind of accident from any
previously evaluated since there is no physical change to the facility or the set points for the main steam safety valves.
The valves will be tested in accordance with current requirements. No new failure mode is introduced due to the change
because no plant change is being made and main steam safety valve test methods are consistent with the endorsed edition
of the ASME Code.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(3) Use of the modified specification would not involve a significant reduction in a margin of safety. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The existing technical specification references an outdated version of the ASME Code. This change corrects the reference
to Specification 4.0.5 which ensures that in-service testing of ASME Code Class 1, 2, and 3 pumps and valves will be
performed in accordance with a periodically updated version of Section XI of the ASME Boiler and Pressure Vessel Code
and Addenda as required by 10 CFR 50.55a. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Safety valve setpoints or tolerances are not changed by this proposal. Therefore, the modified specification corrects
the ASME Code reference and does not involve a significant reduction in a margin of safety.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Based on the above, we have determined that the proposed amendment does not (1) involve a significant increase in the
probability or consequences of an accident previously evaluated, (2) create the probability of a new or different
kind of accident from any previously evaluated, or (3) involve a significant reduction in a margin of safety; and therefore
does not involve a significant hazards consideration.

Definitions
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The revisions to Definition 15, ``Primary Containment Integrity'' and Definition 16, ``Secondary Containment
Integrity'' agree with the corresponding definitions of the STS. These changes are administrative in nature in that
they only clarify the requirements for containment integrity and the appropriate means of isolating penetrations.
These changes do not affect the operation or function of the containment isolation systems and, therefore, do not
result in a significant increase in the probability or consequences of an accident previously evaluated.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Primary Containment Integrity
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The revision to TS section 3.7.A, ``Primary Containment Integrity'', only adds a specific requirement to restore
primary containment integrity within 1 hour or commence a plant shutdown. These actions are consistent with the actions
specified in STS for primary containment integrity. No changes to the primary containment boundary or the requirements
for primary containment integrity have been proposed. Therefore, this change does not result in a significant increase
in the probability or consequences of an accident previously evaluated.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Primary Containment Power Operated Isolation Valves 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The revisions to TS section 3.7.B, ``Primary Containment Power Operated Isolation Valves'' are editorial in nature
in that the wording has only been changed to be consistent with the STS requirements for primary containment isolation
valves. These changes do not affect the function of the valves, the requirements to isolate a penetration with an inoperable
containment isolation valve or the actual methods of isolation. Penetrations are still required to be isolated within
4 hours in a manner that cannot be adversely affected by a single active failure. Therefore, these changes do not result
in a significant increase in the probability or consequences of an accident previously evaluated.

<!-- PJG 0017 degreeslatlong -->
&cir;F) corresponds to the initial drywell average temperature assumed for this analysis in the UFSAR. The specified

affect the actual operation or function of any equipment but will ensure that the containment analysis remains valid.
Therefore, the addition of this limit will not result in a significant increase in the probability or consequences
of an accident previously evaluated.

Pressure Suppression Chamber-Reactor Building Vacuum Breakers
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The changes to TS section 3/4.7.D only provide additional detail and operability requirements for the pressure suppression
chamber-reactor building vacuum breakers. These additional details are consistent with the requirements of STS.
Specifying separate operability requirements for vacuum breakers inoperable for opening (but known to be closed),
or open better reflects the dual functions of these valves (vacuum relief and containment isolation). The additional
surveillance requirement will better ensure that the containment isolation function of these valves is maintained.
The rewording of existing surveillances only clarifies current requirements. These changes do not affect the actual
function, setpoints, or number of valves required to be operable and therefore do not result in a significant increase
in the probability or consequences of an accident previously evaluated.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Drywell-Pressure Suppression Chamber Vacuum Breakers 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The changes to TS section 3/4.7.E, only provide additional detail and operability requirements for the drywell-pressure
suppression chamber vacuum breakers. These additional details are consistent with the requirements of STS. Specifying
separate operability requirements for vacuum breakers inoperable for opening (but known to be closed) or open better
reflects the dual functions of these valves. The additional requirement to verify that each vacuum breaker is closed
at least once per week will better ensure that the isolation boundary between the drywell and torus is maintained.
The elimination of the requirement to exercise all operable drywell-pressure suppression chamber vacuum breakers
upon determination that a vacuum breaker is inoperable for opening will not affect the reliability of these vacuum
breakers. The only valid reason to exercise the operable vacuum breakers is if a common mode failure is suspected.
We have reviewed the maintenance history of these valves and have not identified any instance of common mode failures.
Conditional testing of these changes will not result in a significant increase in the probability or consequences
of an accident previously evaluated.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Main Steam Isolation Valve Leakage Control System (MSIV-LCS)
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The change to TS Section 3/4.7.F, ``MSIV-LCS'', deletes the unnecessary and potentially non-conservative conditional
surveillance testing of the redundant MSIV-LCS subsystems. Although the proposed change will reduce the amount
of testing of the MSIV-LCS, reliability of these systems would not be decreased and the necessary assurance that the
alternate systems/subsystems/components will operate when needed is provided by the ASME Section XI IST Program.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The possibility of human error will decrease with reduced testing. Human error such as a misalignment of valves after
the system is returned to its normal configuration following testing and the misdirection of the operators attention
from monitoring and directing plant operations is less likely to occur if this testing is eliminated. Additionally,
reducing the scope and frequency of surveillance testing will decrease the probability of equipment failure (due
to testing) which could require plant shutdown. Therefore, this change will not increase the probability of occurrence
or consequences of an accident previously evaluated.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Suppression Pool Level and Temperature
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The changes to TS section 3/4.7.F, ``Suppression Pool Level and Temperature'', are intended to clarify these requirements
and make them more consistent with STS. The revision to the applicability statement which deletes the requirement
for suppression pool level and temperature to be within the specified limits during work which has the potential to
drain the vessel is in accordance with STS. Suppression pool level and temperature limits ensure that the suppression
pool has the capability of acting as a heat sink for design basis events but are not appropriate or applicable during
the refueling or cold shutdown conditions. No changes have been made to the actual suppression pool temperature or
level limits and therefore, the assumptions made in the accident and transient analyses remain valid. These limits
are consistent with the STS. The revisions to the surveillance requirements are also intended to improve clarity
and consistency with STS. The deletion of the requirement to monitor suppression pool water temperature every 5 minutes
during relief valve operation is appropriate in that plant operating and emergency operating procedures already
specify what actions are to be taken when suppression pool average water temperature increases above 95
<!-- PJG 0017 degreeslatlong -->
&cir;F including initiation of suppression pool cooling. Monitoring pool temperature every 5 minutes during these
events is not necessary and is redundant to other actions. Therefore, these changes will not significantly increase
the probability of occurrence of the consequences of an accident previously evaluated.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Containment Atmosphere Dilution
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The revisions to the applicability of TS section 3.7.H, ``Containment Atmosphere Dilution'', requiring the containment
atmosphere dilution system to be operable only when the reactor is in power operation and the primary containment
is required to be inerted will not significantly increase the probability or consequences of an accident previously
evaluated because the CAD system can only function when the containment is inerted. The function of the CAD system
is to inject nitrogen into the containment after a LOCA and ensure the containment remains inerted. Drywell inspections
performed after plant startup and prior to plant shutdown require that the primary containment be de-inerted for
personnel access. Therefore, CAD system operability is not required during these inspections. No changes to the
actual function or purpose of the CAD system are proposed.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Oxygen Concentration
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The changes to TS section 3/4.7.1, ``Oxygen Concentration'' are administrative in that they only clarify the requirement
that both the suppression chamber and the drywell must have oxygen concentrations less than 4 [percent] by volume.
The revisions to the surveillance requirements are consistent with STS. Decreasing the frequency of verification
of oxygen concentration from twice per week to once per week is in accordance with STS and reflects the fact that during
power operation, the containment is inerted and slightly pressurized such that air (oxygen) cannot leak into the
containment. Therefore, these changes will not significantly increase the probability or consequences of an accident
previously evaluated.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Secondary Containment
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The deletion of the requirement to operate the SGTS immediately after a secondary containment violation is identified
will not affect the reliability of the secondary containment in that containment integrity is normally fully restored
immediately after a violation is identified. The testing of the SGTS involves insertion of a Group III containment
isolation signal and is only appropriate if the restoration of secondary containment involves a temporary or new
secondary containment boundary. These modifications to a secondary containment boundary, however, would require
that the SGTS be operated as part of post modification testing. Deleting the requirement for the SGTS to be operated
after minor secondary containment violations will reduce the possibility of human error (such as misalignment of
valves after the system is returned to its normal configuration) due to reduced testing. Operation of the SGTS after
a secondary containment violation is not required by STS. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Revision of the definition of calm wind conditions will not affect the reliability or availability of the secondary
containment or SGTS. An engineering evaluation on the effects of wind speed and direction on the ability of the SGTS
to maintain 1/4'' vacuum in secondary containment has been performed. The results indicate that while wind effects
can be seen on individual instruments, there is minimal effect on the average instrument readings with wind speeds
up to 15 mph. A discussion of this evaluation has been added to the Bases of TS section 3.7. Therefore, these changes
will not significantly increase the probability or the consequences of an accident previously evaluated.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Secondary Containment Automatic Isolation Dampers
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The addition of operability requirements, actions and surveillance requirements for secondary containment isolation
dampers better ensures the integrity and isolation capability of the secondary containment. The new specifications
are consistent with the requirements of the STS. The actual function or operation of the secondary containment isolation
valves/dampers will not be affected. The appropriate valves/dampers will be incorporated in plant procedures that
are subject to the change control provisions of TS. Therefore, these changes will not increase the probability of
occurrence or consequences of an accident previously evaluated in the TS. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Standby Gas Treatment System
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The change to the output requirements of the inlet heaters for each train of the SGTS from 11 kw to 22 kw better ensures
that these heaters (and the SGTS) can perform their design function. The 22 kw output requirement ensures that the
inlet air humidity does not exceed the 70 [percent] humidity specified in the UFSAR. This change does not affect the
actual operation of the heaters or the SGTS.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The requirement to demonstrate the HEPA filter uniform air distribution after HEPA filter replacement or after structural
maintenance on the filter system housing (rather than annually) will not decrease the reliability of the SGTS. The
air flow test will be performed after work or modifications which have the ability to disrupt the system geometry or
result in potential flow blockage.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Revising the shutdown LCO requirement in the various specifications from requiring the plant to be in Cold Shutdown
in 24 hours to requiring Hot Shutdown in 12 hours and Cold Shutdown (or other condition not requiring equipment operability)
in the following 24 hours is consistent with STS and the shutdown requirements in TS section 3.5. This new requirement
will allow the reactor to be shutdown in a more controlled manner and will not result in a significant increase in the
probability or consequences of an accident previously evaluated.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The revisions to the Bases are administrative in that they only reflect the changes to the individual specifications
described previously in this section or correct minor discrepancies. All changes are consistent with the applicable
specifications. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(2) The proposed amendment will not increase the possibility of a new or different kind of accident from any accident
previously evaluated for the following reasons.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
As described in the above response to question #1, none of the proposed changes alters the design of the plant or equipment
or the plant's transient response. The changes to the definitions and limiting conditions for operation applicable
to TS section 3.7 are consistent with STS and better ensure that equipment assumed to be operable in our accident analysis
will be operable upon demand. The addition of limiting conditions for operation for drywell average temperature
and secondary containment isolation valves will better ensure that the assumptions in our accident analysis remain
valid.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The changes to the surveillance requirements are consistent with the STS. Those systems required to mitigate accidents
evaluated in the UFSAR will still be operable and available.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The reduction in conditional surveillance testing of certain systems and equipment will reduce the probability
of equipment failure as a result of excessive testing or due to human error.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(3) The proposed amendment will not involve a significant reduction in a margin of safety for the following reasons.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The revisions to the limiting conditions for operation in Chapter 3.7 of the TS will not invalidate the original licensing
basis assumptions and will not invalidate any assumptions or input parameters for any DAEC event analysis. These
changes provide more specific guidance only and are in accordance with the STS. Extending the time period within which
the DAEC must achieve Cold Shutdown conditions will permit increased operator attention and minimal distractions
for operators during shutdown, thus minimizing the risks of unexpected operational transients.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Additional surveillance testing for certain instrumentation and systems will provide additional assurance that
these systems will be available when needed.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Elimination of unnecessary or conditional surveillance testing will not reduce the minimum necessary equipment
operability requirements or equipment reliability. Elimination of the redundant testing will reduce equipment
failure due to excessive testing or human error.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In summary, the proposed administrative changes do not change the probability or consequences of an accident previously
evaluated, do not create the possibility of a new or different kind of accident and do not involve a reduction in the
margin of safety.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Therefore, the proposed license amendment is judged to involve no significant hazards consideration.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Basis for proposed no significant hazards consideration determination: 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
As required by 10 CFR 50.91(a), the licensee has provided its analysis of the issue of no significant hazards consideration,
which is presented below:
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
...The proposed change does not involve an SHC [significant hazards consideration] because the change would not:
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->
1. Involve a significant increase in the probability or consequences of an accident previously evaluated.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The proposed change affects only an administrative control, which was based on the existing industry guidance in
ANSI N18.1-1971, that recommended the Operations Manager hold a SRO license. The current guidance in Section 4.2.2
of ANSI/ANS-3.1-1987 recommends, as one option, that the Operations Manager have held a license for a similar unit
and the Operations Middle Manager hold a SRO license. The Operations Middle Manager position does not exist at NNECO
[Northeast Nuclear Energy Company]. Therefore, the proposed change requests an exception to ANSI N18.1-1971 to
allow use of ANSI/ANS-3.101987 in a limited circumstance. Specifically, the proposed revision to Technical Specification
6.3.1 would temporarily allow the Operations Manager to have held a SRO at a PWR [pressurized water reactor] other
than Millstone Unit No. 3. The proposed revision would be in effect for the period ending three years after the Staff's
approval for this request.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The proposed exception to ANSI N18.1-1971 will allow at least one of the Operations Assistants (instead of a Operations
Middle Manager) to hold, and continue to hold, a SRO license, if the Operations Manager does not hold a license. The
proposed change includes the requirement if the Operations Manager does not hold a SRO license at Millstone Unit No.
3, he shall have held a license for a similar unit in accordance with Section 4.2.2 of ANSI/ANS-3.1-1987. For those
areas of knowledge that require a SRO license, at least one of the Operations Assistants hold a SRO license and provides
technical guidance normally required by the Operations Manager. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The proposed change does not alter the design of any system, structure, or component. It does not change the way any
plant systems are operated. It does not reduce the knowledge, qualifications, or skills of any operator on watch,
and does not affect the way the Operations Department is managed by the Operations Manager in maintaining the effective
performance of his personnel and to ensure the plant is operated safely and in accordance with the requirements of
the Operating License. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The proposed change does not detract from the Operations Manager's ability to perform his primary responsibilities.
In this case, by having previously held a SRO license for a similar unit, he will have gained the necessary training,
skills, and experience to fully understand the operation of plant equipment and the watch requirements for operators.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The proposed change does not weaken the supervisory chain that presently exists in the Operations Department. All
Control Room operators will continue to be supervised by the licensed Shift Supervisor. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In summary, the proposed change does not affect the ability of the Operations Manager to provide the plant oversight
required of his position. In addition, it does not have any [e]ffect on the probability or consequences of any previously
evaluated accident.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
2. Create the possibility of a new or different kind of accident from any previously evaluated.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The proposed change to Technical Specification 6.3.1 does not affect the design or function of any plant system, structure,
or component. It does not affect, in any way, the performance of NRC licensed operators, nor does it change the way any
plant equipment is operated. Operation of the plant in conformance with technical specifications and other license
requirements will continue to be supervised by personnel who hold an NRC SRO license. The proposed change to Technical
Specification 6.3.1 ensures that the Operations Manager will be a knowledgeable and qualified individual. The proposed
change does not introduce any new failure modes. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
3. Involve a significant reduction in a margin of safety. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The proposed change involves only an administrative control which is not related to the margin of safety as defined
in the technical specifications. The proposed change does not reduce the level of knowledge or experience required
of an individual who fills the Operations Manager position, nor does it affect the conservative manner in which the
plant is operated. All Control Room operators will continue to be supervised by personnel who hold a SRO license.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->
I. This proposal does not involve a significant increase in the probability or consequences of an accident previously
evaluated. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The proposed Technical Specification change to extend the monthly surveillance interval for Spray Pond ground water
level measurement to biannual does not affect the the probability or consequences of an accident previously evaluated.
The safety analysis performed for this change concludes that the ground water level is stable, predictable, and significantly
below the acceptance criteria established in the Technical Specifications. Thus, less frequent monitoring of the
ground water level does not increase the probability that the Spray Pond will become inoperable due to rising ground
water levels or the probability of any accident scenarios associated with Spray Pond inoperability. The Technical
Specification change will not impact the function or the method of operation of plant systems, structures, or components.
Thus, the consequences of a malfunction of equipment important to safety previously evaluated in the FSAR are not
increased by the change. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
II. This proposal does not create the possibility of a new or different kind of accident or from any accident previously

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The proposed Technical Specification change to extend the monthly surveillance interval for Spray Pond ground water
level measurement to biannual does not create the possibility of a new or different kind of accident or from any accident
previously evaluated. The proposed change dies not affect systems, structures, or components (SSCs) or the operation
of the SSCs; and therefore does not create the possibility of a new or different kind of accident.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
III. This change does not involve a significant reduction in a margin of safety.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The proposed Technical Specification change to extend the monthly surveillance frequency to biannual does not reduce
the margin of safety. The ground water level in the vicinity of the Spray Pond has been proven to be stable and predictable
through twelve years of monthly data collection. This data has shown the highest ground water levels (still considerably
lower than the Technical Specification limit) to occur in the months of April and October. Therefore, surveillance
of the ground water level at the observation sites during April and October will adequately monitor this aspect of
the Spray Pond operability.

are no modifications or changes in operating conditions associated with the proposed changes. Providing a more accurate
description of a referenced radiation monitor in the note is editorial. The proposed changes do not affect the probability
of occurrence or the consequences of accidents identified in the UFSAR. No accident precursors are being generated
by the proposed changes. Therefore, the proposed changes do not involve a significant increase in the probability
or consequences of a previously analyzed accident.

The change to the note on Table 3.3-6 is editorial to provide a more accurate description of the required radiation
monitor. Therefore, the changes to the surveillance frequencies do not involve a significant reduction in any margin
of safety.

The proposed amendment would revise the Ginna Station Technical Specification (TS) 3.1.4 regarding allowable primary
coolant levels of specific activity. The limit for I-131 dose equivalent of iodine activity in the reactor coolant
would be increased from 0.2 to 1.0 micro Ci/gm. The limit for total specific activity of the reactor coolant would be
increased from 84 to 100/E micro Ci/gm, where E is the average beta and gamma energies per disintegration in Mev. Both
increased allowable levels are consistent with NUREG-1431 ``Standard Technical Specifications, Westinghouse
Plants, September 1992,'' and

The proposed amendment would remove Core Spray (CS) High Sparger Pressure Instrumentation from the Vermont Yankee

Basis for proposed no significant hazards consideration determination: 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

As required by 10 CFR 50.91(a), the licensee has provided its analysis of the issue of no significant hazards consideration,
which is presented below:
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->
1. The proposed change to remove the Core Spray High Sparger Pressure Instrumentation from the Technical Specifications
for ECCS Actuation Instrumentation is consistent with NRC requirements concerning this instrumentation. This
instrumentation is considered NNS [nonnuclear safety] and performs a local monitoring and alarm function only.
In addition, the NRC has recently approved the removal of Core Spray Sparger Break Detection Instrumentation from
the Technical Specifications of another BWR [boiling water reactor] with a similar situation.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The CS Sparger Piping is inspected every refueling outage to verify its integrity. No cracks in the CS Sparger piping
have been identified since the first inspection in 1980. CS Sparger Piping integrity is still assured. The instrumentation
systems to be removed from the ECCS Actuation Instrumentation Technical Specifications do not perform any automatic
control or trip function. In addition, this instrumentation does not provide information that is required to permit
the control room operator to take manual actions that are required for safety systems to accomplish their safety functions
for design basis accident events.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The proposed change does not result in any system hardware modification, function change or new plant configuration.
The requested change to ECCS Actuation Instrumentation does not impact any FSAR [Final Safety Analysis Report] safety
analysis involving the ECCS or Protection Systems. These monitoring functions are not contributors to the initiation
of accidents.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The administrative changes to correct typographical errors on Tables 3.2.1 and 4.2.1 will have no affect on plant
hardware, plant design, safety limit setting or plant system operation and therefore, do not modify or add any initiating
parameters that would significantly increase the probability or consequences of any previously analyzed accident.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Therefore, it is concluded that there is not a significant increase in the probability or consequence of an accident
previously evaluated.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
2. The function of the Core Spray High Sparger Pressure Instrumentation to be removed from the Technical Specifications
is for local indication and alarm only. These functions are not necessary for operators to accomplish any safety functions.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The proposed change does not involve any change in hardware, function, Technical Specification trip setpoints,
plant operation, redundancy, protective function or design basis of the plant. There is no impact on any existing
safety analysis or safety design limits. Core Spray High Sparger Pressure Instrumentation functions do not initiate
nuclear system parameter variations which are considered potential initiating causes of threats to the fuel and
the nuclear system process barrier.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
As discussed above, the proposed administrative change only corrects typographical errors concerning equipment
identification numbers. This change doe not affect any equipment and it does not involve any potential initiating
events that would create any new or different kind of accident.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Therefore, the proposed changes do not create the possibility of a new or different kind of accident from any accident
previously evaluated.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
3. The proposed change to remove the Core Spray High Sparger Pressure Instrumentation from the Technical Specifications
for ECCS Actuation Instrumentation does not affect any existing safety margins. This equipment is NNS and performs
a local indication and alarming function only. The original intent of this detection system was because the first
BWR plants had only the CS System for long-term core cooling. Later, plants like VY [Vermont Yankee] were provided
with Low Pressure Coolant Injection (LPCI) Systems in addition to CS.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Existing Technical Specification requirements for automatic trip functions are unaffected. Failure of the Core
Spray High Sparger Pressure Instrumentation does not preclude the ability of the CS System to perform its safety function
to mitigate the consequences of accidents or of any other safety system to accomplish its safety functions. Proper
ECCS functioning post-accident is not relied upon by NNS alarming functions but by such systems as safety related
reactor level indication.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The CS Sparger Piping is inspected every refueling outage to verify its integrity. No cracks in the CS Sparger piping
have been identified since the first inspection in 1980. The removal from the Technical Specifications has no affect
on the bases of Protective Instrumentation which is to operate to initiate required system protective actions. The
Core Spray High Sparger Pressure Instrumentation does not perform any safety function.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
As discussed above, the proposed administrative change which corrects typographical errors does not affect any
equipment involved in potential initiating events or safety limits. [***].
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Based upon the above, it is concluded that the proposed changes do not involve a significant reduction in a margin of
safety.

On December 6, 1993, the licensee submitted a significant modification to its original request of March 18, 1992 (April
19, 1992 (57 FR 12349)). The modified request would amend the Technical Specifications (TS) to provide two surveillance
tests to determine the operability of the catalyst beds in the containment atmospheric control (CAC) system. One
test compares hydrogen content in the influent to the hydrogen content in effluent process streams to assure the catalyst
is operating. The second test measures the temperature profile in the catalyst bed to ensure that sufficient catalyst
remains available for the recombination process during postulated accident conditions. Since the original proposal
has been significantly changed, the staff is issuing a new notice and proposed no significant hazards consideration
determination.

The NRC staff has reviewed the licensee's analysis against the standards of 10 CFR 50.92(c). The staff's review is
presented below: 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->
1. Does the amendment involve a significant increase in the probability or consequences of an accident previously
evaluated?
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The proposed change does not involve any changes in the design or operation of the hydrogen recombiners, which are
accident mitigation systems. The proposed change revises surveillance requirements to ensure that existing equipment
will perform as designed in response to postulated events. The proposed change does not, therefore, involve an increase
in the probability or consequences of an accident previously evaluated.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
2. Does the amendment create the possibility of a new or different kind of accident from any accident previously evaluated?
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The proposed change does not involve any changes in the design or operation of existing equipment, and does not, therefore,
create the possibility of a new or different kind of accident from any accident previously evaluated.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
3. Does the amendment involve a significant reduction in a margin of safety?
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The proposed change increases surveillance requirements for existing equipment to ensure that the equipment will
perform as designed. With equipment performing as designed in response to postulated accidents, the proposed change
does not affect any existing margins of safety.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Based on the licensee's analysis and the staff's analysis, it appears that the three standards of 10 CFR 50.92(c) are
satisfied. Therefore, the NRC staff proposes to determine that the amendment request involves no significant hazards

&cir;F, they shall be declared inoperable when 350
<!-- PJG 0017 degreeslatlong -->
&cir;F is exceeded. Furthermore, when the reactor is &gt; 350
<!-- PJG 0017 degreeslatlong -->
&cir;F, an auxiliary feedwater pump low discharge pressure trip channel may be inoperable for a period not to exceed
4 hours. If this time is exceeded, the associated auxiliary feedwater pump shall be declared inoperable and the appropriate
limiting condition for operation of TS 3.4.b.2 entered. The intent of adding these operability requirements to the
TS's is to ensure the availability of the components. The proposed change is an additional restriction not presently

Description of amendment request: 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The amendment request proposes to revise the Technical Specifications (TS) to implement the NRC's Final Policy Statement
on Technical Specification Improvements for Nuclear Power Reactors (58 FR 39132). These improvements involve focusing
the Technical Specifications on those requirements that are of controlling importance to operational safety by
screening each TS in Section 3/4.1 through 3/4.11 using the criteria provided in the policy statement. The purpose
of the proposed amendment request is to relocate the specifications that do not meet any of the four policy statement
criteria. The relocated specifications will be moved to Updated Final Safety Analysis (USAR) Chapter 16. Based on
the screening, all or part of 38 technical specifications were identified as not meeting any of the criteria and, therefore,
as candidates for relocation. The licensee has categorized the TS changes as (1) specifications relocated intact
to USAR Chapter 16, (2) specifications relocated with portions retained in TS, (3) specifications relocated with
programmatic requirements referenced in Section 6 of TS, (4) modifications to retained specifications to accomodate
relocation of other specifications, and (5) new specification requirements incorporated into the TS. The last category
is used to effect the retention of portions of relocated specifications and accomodate the policy statement recommendation
to incorporate industry experience in the determination of TS content.

Basis for proposed no significant hazards consideration determination: 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
As required by 10 CFR 50.91(a), the licensee has provided its analysis of the issue of no significant hazards consideration,
which is presented below:
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->
1. The proposed changes do not involve a significant increase in the probability or consequences of an accident previously
evaluated.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The proposed Technical Specification changes involve relocating requirements that are not conditions or limitations
on reactor operation necessary to obviate the possibility of an abnormal situation or event giving rise to an immediate
threat to the public health and safety. The proposed changes were identified through the application of criteria
designed to cull those requirements that are not important to operational safety from the Technical Specifications.
In this process, selected provisions of the Technical Specifications identified for relocation were retained if
necessary to support a Technical Specification that was to be retained. Thus, only specification requirements that
have little or no operational safety significance are proposed for relocation. In addition, those requirements
that would be relocated will be included in the Updated Final Safety Analysis Report (USAR) and, therefore, will be
controlled and implemented as NRC commitments. In this manner, those requirements that have no operational safety
significance but involve maintaining the plant in its as-designed state (for example, through surveillance programs)
would be controlled.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In addition, the criteria for identifying requirements to be retained in the Technical Specifications specifically
call out, for retention, those structures, systems, or components that are required to mitigate accidents previously
evaluated.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Based on the above, the proposed changes do not involve a significant increase in the probability or consequences
of an accident previously evaluated.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
2. The proposed changes do not create the possibility of a new or different kind of accident from any previously evaluated.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->
The proposed changes involve relocating Technical Specification requirements to another licensee-controlled
document. No changes or physical alterations of the plant are involved. Also, no changes to the operation of the plant
or equipment are involved. Therefore, the proposed changes do not create the possibility of a new or different kind
of accident from any previously evaluated.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
3. Do the proposed changes involve a significant reduction in the margin of safety.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The proposed changes involve relocating Technical Specification requirements to the USAR. The requirements to
be relocated were identified by applying the criteria endorsed in the Commission's Policy Statement. Thus, those
specifications that would be relocated do not impose constraints on design and operation of the plant that are derived
form the plant safety analysis report or from probabilistic safety assessment (PSA) information and do not belong
in the Technical Specifications in accordance with 10 CFR 50.36 and the purpose of the Technical Specifications stated
in the Policy Statement. Therefore, relocation of these requirements does not involve a significant reduction in
the margin of safety.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In addition, revisions to the USAR will be evaluated in accordance with the 10 CFR 50.59 process which considers the
reduction in safety margin. Therefore, any future revisions to the provisions in the USAR will consider reductions
in the margin of safety using the criteria for identifying an unreviewed safety question.

Basis for proposed no significant hazards consideration determination:

As required by 10 CFR 50.91(a), the licensee has provided its analysis of the issue of no significant hazards consideration,
which is presented below:
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->
1. The proposed change does not involve a significant increase in the probability or consequences of an accident previously
evaluated.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The probability of occurrence and the consequences of an accident evaluated previously in the Updated Safety Analysis
Report (USAR) are not increased due to the proposed technical specification change. Operation at 3565 MWt does not
affect any of the mechanisms postulated in the USAR to cause LOCA or non-LOCA design basis events. Analyses, evaluations
and minimum DNBR [departure from nucleate boiling ratio] calculations confirm that the USAR conclusions remain
valid for the proposed changes. On these bases it is concluded that the probability and consequences of the accidents
previously evaluated in the USAR are not increased.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
2. The proposed change does not create the possiblity of a new or different kind of accident from any previously evaluated.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
There is no new type of accident or malfunction being created. The proposed change provides revised operating limits
necessary to support Cycle 8, and does not change the method and manner of plant operation. The safety design bases
in the USAR have not been altered. Thus, this change does not create the possibility of a new or different kind of accident
from any previously evaluated.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
3. The proposed change does not involve a significant reduction in the margin of safety.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The proposed changes do not change the plant configuration in a way that introduces a new potential hazard to the plant
and do not involve a significant reduction in the margin of safety. The analyses and evaluations discussed in the safety
evaluation demonstrate that all applicable safety analysis acceptance criteria continue to be met for the proposed
operating conditions. Items not specifically cited in this safety evaluation have been reviewed and have been found
to be bounded by the evaluations performed for Reference 1 [Wolf Creek Generating Station Technical Specifications].
Therefore, it is concluded that the margin of safety, as described in the bases to any technical specification, is
not reduced.

Brief description of amendment: 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The amendment modifies the technical specifications (TS) to address new containment purge and vent valves to be installed
in the 1994 refueling outage. The amendment changes the containment purge and vent valve TS as follows: (1) removes
the requirement ensuring that valve position remains at less than or equal to 70 degrees, (2) changes the containment
leak testing requirements for the metal-to-metal seated valves from 6 months to 2 years since they have improved seat
designs, and (3) makes administrative changes to delete an out-of-date note, to relocate an action statement requirement
from the TS surveillance section to the TS action statement section, and to change a related TS reference to this surveillance
section. Valve opening position does not need to be limited to less than or equal to 70 degrees. The resiliently-seated
valves have a permanently installed mechanical stop to limit the open position to ensure adequate closure times.
The metal-to-metal seated valves are designed to close from the 90-degree open position.

The amendment revises the WNP-2 Technical Specifications. Specifically, the amendment increases the stroke time,
as specified in Table 3.6.3-1, for reactor core isolation cooling (RCIC) valve RCIC-V-8 from 13 seconds to 26 seconds
and deletes the Note (j) reference from RCIC-V-8 and RCIC-V-63. Note (j) indicates that the stroke time specified
in the table reflects the requirement for containment isolation only.
