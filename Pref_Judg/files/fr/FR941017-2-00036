<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
On October 9, 1991, EPA promulgated revised Criteria for MSWLFs (40 CFR Part 258). Subtitle D of RCRA, as amended by
the Hazardous and Solid Waste Amendments of 1984 (HSWA), requires states to develop permitting programs to ensure
that MSWLFs comply with the Federal Criteria under 40 CFR part 258. Subtitle D also requires in Section 4005(c)(1)(C),
42 U.S.C. 6945(c)(1)(C), that EPA determine the adequacy of state municipal solid waste landfill permit programs
to ensure that facilities comply with the revised Federal Criteria. To fulfill this requirement, the Agency has drafted
and is in the process of proposing a State/Tribal Implementation Rule (STIR). The rule will specify the requirements
which State/Tribal programs must satisfy to be determined adequate. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The EPA intends to approve State/Tribal MSWLF permit programs prior to the promulgation of STIR. EPA interprets the
requirements for states or tribes to develop ``adequate'' programs for permits or other forms of prior approval and
conditions (for example, license to operate) to impose several minimum requirements. First, each State/Tribe must
have enforceable standards for new and existing MSWLFs that are technically comparable to EPA's revised MSWLF criteria.
Next, the State/Tribe must have the authority to issue a permit or other notice of prior approval and conditions to
all new and existing MSWLFs in its jurisdiction. The State/Tribe also must provide for public participation in permit
issuance and enforcement, as required in Section 7004(b) of RCRA, 42 U.S.C. 6974(b). Finally, the State/Tribe must
show that it has sufficient compliance monitoring and enforcement authorities to take specific action against any
owner or operator that fails to comply with an approved MSWLF program. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
EPA Regions will determine whether a State/Tribe has submitted an ``adequate'' program based on the interpretation
outlined above. EPA plans to provide more specific criteria for this evaluation when it proposes the STIR. EPA expects
States/Tribes to meet all of these requirements for all elements of a MSWLF program before it gives full approval to
a MSWLF program.

B. State of New Hampshire

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
On July 7, 1993, EPA Region I received New Hampshire's final MSWLF Permit Program application for adequacy determination.
Region I reviewed the final application, submitted comments to New Hampshire, and requested additional information
about state program implementation. New Hampshire addressed EPA's comments, provided the requested additional
information, and submitted a revised final application for adequacy determination on August 30, 1994. Region I has
reviewed New Hampshire's revised application and has tentatively determined that all portions of New Hampshire's
MSWLF program meet all the requirements necessary to qualify for full program approval and ensures compliance with
the revised Federal Criteria. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The public may submit written comments on EPA's tentative determination until November 16, 1994. Copies of New Hampshire's
application are available for inspection and copying at the location indicated in the

 section of this notice.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The State of New Hampshire's 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Solid Waste Rules 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
reflect the dynamic nature of solid waste management by establishing minimum standards to protect human health and
the environment as well as performance-based standards. These requirements are in keeping with the Federal Criteria
for municipal solid waste disposal in that they specify a standard to be achieved and then allow flexibility to achieve
that standard in innovative ways. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
To ensure full compliance with the Federal Criteria, New Hampshire has revised its current MSWLF permitting requirements
by development of the 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Guidance Document for the State Permitting of Municipal Solid Waste Landfills Regulated Under Federal Rules (40
CFR Part 258) in New Hampshire.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 This guidance document has incorporated those requirements from the federal criteria not found in the State's existing
MSWLF program and are applicable to all existing MSWLFs and to all MSWLF permit applications. New Hampshire will implement
its MSWLF permit program through enforceable permit conditions. These new requirements occur in the following areas:

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
1. The adoption of the following definitions as required by the revised Federal Criteria, 40 CFR 258.2: active life,
active portion, director, household waste, industrial solid waste, owner, saturated zone, sludge, solid waste,
state, state director, and waste management unit boundary. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
2. Compliance with the new location restrictions of 40 CFR 258.10, 258.11. 258.12, 258.13, 258.14, 258.15, and 258.16,
which pertain to airport safety, floodplains, wetlands, fault areas, seismic impact zones, unstable areas and closure
of existing MSWLF units.
