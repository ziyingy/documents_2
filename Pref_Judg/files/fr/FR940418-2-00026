As discussed above in connection with the 1988&hyph;90 restructuring, petitioners alleged several subsidies to
TAS after the second asset transfer and receipt of Italsider's shares by TAS was among them. As we explained, we believe
that we have captured the full benefit to the subject merchandise from the restructuring without analyzing these
individual transactions. Therefore, TAS' payment or non-payment to Italsider is irrelevant to our analysis. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
However, although we did not verify that TAS (in liquidation) paid Italsider for the shares, we do not believe that
TAS kept the proceeds from the sale. This is because the proceeds were so large (1,563 billion lire) that they would
have been more than enough to pay off all of TAS' outstanding liabilities and to return the company to a positive equity
position. However, as TAS' books indicate, this did not happen.

Petitioners maintain that although evidence presented at verification may demonstrate that Terni received Law
750/81 funds based on its identity as a producer of forgings and castings, the Department nevertheless found that
Terni's accounting records did not reflect that these grants were designated only for the production of forgings
and castings. Therefore, petitioners argue that Terni treated and accounted for these grants as general funds, and
did not specifically allocate them to its forgings and castings operations.

We find these grants to be not countervailable since they applied to merchandise not subject to this investigation.
We disagree with petitioners' argument that Terni's treatment of these funds as ``general funds'' demonstrates
that they were not specifically allocated to the production of forgings and castings. We stated in the 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
GIA
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 that when a company receives a general subsidy, the Department does not attempt to ``trace'' or establish how the subsidy
was used. Conversely, if the subsidy is tied to the production of merchandise other than the merchandise under investigation,
the Department also does not attempt to trace or establish how the subsidy was ultimately used. Furthermore, we believe
that respondents provided sufficient documentation, which is fully discussed in the ILVA verification report,
that grants under this program specifically applied to the production of forgings and castings. As stated in the GIA
at 37267, if the benefit is tied to a product other than the merchandise under investigation, the Department will not
find a countervailable subsidy on the subject merchandise.

In accordance with section 776(b) of the Act, we verified the information used in making our final determination.
We followed standard verification procedures, including meeting with government and company officials, examination
of relevant accounting records and examination of original source documents. Our verification results are outlined
in detail in the public versions of the verification reports, which are on file in the Central Records Unit (room B&hyph;099
of the Main Commerce Building).

In accordance with our affirmative preliminary determination, we instructed the U.S. Customs Service to suspend
liquidation of all entries of electrical steel from Italy, which were entered or withdrawn from warehouse for consumption,

entries of the merchandise after that date in the amounts indicated below.

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
In accordance with section 705(d) of the Act, we will notify the ITC of our determination. In addition, we are making
available to the ITC all nonprivileged and nonproprietary information relating to this investigation. We will allow
the ITC access to all privileged and business proprietary information in our files, provided the ITC confirms that
it will not disclose such information, either publicly or under an administrative protective order, without the
written consent of the Deputy Assistant Secretary for Investigations, Import Administration. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
If the ITC determines that material injury, or threat of material injury, does not exist, these proceedings will be
terminated and all estimated duties deposited or securities posted as a result of the suspension of liquidation will
be refunded or cancelled. If, however, the ITC determines that such injury does exist, we will issue a countervailing
duty order directing Customs officers to assess countervailing duties on electrical steel from Italy.
