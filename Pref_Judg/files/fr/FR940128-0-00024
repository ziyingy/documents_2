Policy used to determine whether to make representative payment.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 (1) In accordance with section 12 of the Railroad Retirement Act, the Board's policy is that every annuitant has the
right to manage his or her own benefits. However, some annuitants due to mental or physical condition or due to their
youth may be unable to do so. If the Board determines that the interests of an annuitant would be better served if benefit
payments were certified to another person as representative payee, the Board will appoint a representative payee
in accordance with the procedures set forth in this part. The Board may appoint a representative payee even if the annuitant
is a legally competent individual. If the annuitant is a legally incompetent individual, the Board may appoint the
legal guardian or some other person as a representative payee.

(2) If payment is being made directly to an annuitant and a question arises concerning his or her ability to manage or
direct the management of benefit payments, the Board may, if the annuitant is 18 years old or older and has not been adjudged
legally incompetent, continue to pay the annuitant until the Board makes a determination about his or her ability
to manage or direct the management of benefit payments and the selection of a representative payee.

(a) Regardless of the receipt of written notice of the appointment of a guardian or other person legally vested with
the care of the person or estate of an incompetent or a minor who is receiving or claiming benefits or to whom any right
or privilege is extended under the law, the Board may, in its discretion, validly recognize actions by and conduct
transactions with others acting on behalf of the individual found by the Board to be a minor or to be unable to manage
his or her affairs, if the Board finds such actions or transactions to be in the best interest of such individual.
