Termination of assisted occupancy
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
. (1) In the Section 8 programs other than Section 8 Certificate, Housing Voucher, and Moderate Rehabilitation programs,
assisted occupancy is terminated by: 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(i) If permitted under the lease, the project owner notifying the family that because of the termination of assisted
occupancy, the family is required to pay the HUD-approved market rent for the dwelling unit.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(ii) The project owner and family entering into a new lease without Section 8 assistance. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(iii) The project owner evicting the family. While the family continues in occupancy of the unit, the project owner
may continue assistance payments in accordance with the Housing Assistance Payments contract if judicial action
to terminate the tenancy and evict the family is promptly initiated and diligently pursued by the project owner in
accordance with the terms of the lease. Action by the project owner to terminate the tenancy and to evict the family
shall be in accordance with HUD regulations and other HUD requirements. For any jurisdiction, HUD may prescribe a
maximum period during which assistance payments may be continued during eviction proceedings and may prescribe
other standards of reasonable diligence for the prosecution of eviction proceedings. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(2) In the Section 8 Certificate, Housing Voucher, and Moderate Rehabilitation programs, assisted occupancy is

The HA shall not make any additional assistance payments to the project owner after the required procedures specified
in this section have been completed. In addition, the HA shall not approve a lease, enter into an assistance contract,
or process a portability move for the family after those procedures have been completed.

(i) Continued assistance (see paragraph (c) of this section); 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(ii) Prorated assistance (see &sect;812.11); or 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

Project owners
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
. With respect to assistance administered by a project owner, HUD has the discretion to determine under what circumstances
families are to be provided one of the three forms of assistance for preservation of the family. HUD is exercising its
discretion by specifying the standards in this section under which a project owner must provide one of the three types
of assistance described in paragraph (a) of this section to a family.

HAs
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
. With respect to an HA acting as a contract administrator of a certificate (including project-based certificate),
housing voucher, or Moderate Rehabilitation program (as opposed to an HA owner), the HA, rather than HUD, has the discretion
to determine the circumstances under which a family will be offered one of these forms of assistance. The HA must establish
its own policy and criteria to follow in making its decision. In establishing the criteria for granting continued
assistance or temporary deferral of termination of assistance, the HA must incorporate the statutory criteria,
which are set forth in paragraphs (c) and (d) of this section.

(c) 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Continued assistance
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
. A mixed family may receive continued housing assistance if all of the following conditions are met: 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(1) The family was receiving assistance under a Section 214 covered program on [
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
insert the effective date of the final rule
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
]; 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(2) The family's head of household or spouse has eligible immigration status as described in &sect;812.5; and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(3) The family does not include any person (who does not have eligible immigration status) other than the head of household,
any spouse of the head of household, any parents of the head of household, any parents of the spouse, or any children
of the head of household or spouse. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Eligibility for this type of assistance
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
. If a mixed family qualifies for prorated assistance (and does not qualify for continued assistance), but decides
not to accept prorated assistance, or if a family has no members with eligible immigration status, the family may be
eligible for temporary deferral of termination of assistance if necessary to permit the family additional time for
the orderly transition of those family members with ineligible status, and any other family members involved, to
other affordable housing. Other affordable housing is used in the context of transition of an ineligible family from
a rent level that reflects HUD assistance to a rent level that is unassisted; the term refers to housing that is not substandard,
that is of appropriate size for the family and that can be rented for an amount not exceeding the amount that the family
pays for rent, including utilities, plus 25 percent.
