This proposed interpretation of the CAA as generally delegating jurisdictional authority to approved Tribes is
also supported by the legislative history, which provides some additional evidence of Congressional attention
to this issue: ``the Act constitutes an express delegation of power to Indian tribes to administer and enforce the
Clean Air Act in Indian lands'' (citation to

Further, it is a well-established principle of statutory construction that statutes should be construed liberally
in favor of Indians, with ambiguous provisions interpreted in ways that benefit tribes. See

Based on recent Supreme Court case law, EPA has construed the term ``reservation'' to incorporate trust land that
has been validly set apart for use by a Tribe, even though that land has not been formally designated as a ``reservation.''

111 S.Ct. 905, 910 (1991). EPA will be guided by relevant case law in interpreting the scope of ``reservation'' under
the CAA. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Section 301(d)(2)(B) of the CAA also provides that a Tribe may be treated in the same manner as a State for functions
regarding air resources ``within the exterior boundaries of the reservation or 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
other areas within the tribe's jurisdiction'' 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
(emphasis added). The emphasized language envisions potential Tribal jurisdiction under the CAA over areas that
lie outside the exterior boundaries of a reservation, upon a fact-based showing of a Tribe's inherent authority over
sources located on such lands. Thus, this provision authorizes an eligible Tribe to develop and implement Tribal
air quality programs on off-reservation lands that are determined to be within the Tribe's inherent jurisdiction.
Accordingly, for purposes of this rule, EPA proposes to conclude that an eligible Tribe may be able to implement its
air quality programs on off-reservation lands up to the limits of ``Indian country,'' as defined in 18 U.S.C. section
1151, provided the Tribe can adequately demonstrate authority to regulate air quality on the off-reservation lands
in question under general principles of Indian law. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In sum, EPA is proposing to interpret the CAA as granting approved Tribes regulatory authority over all air resources
within the exterior boundaries of their reservations. Thus, no independent fact-based showing of inherent Tribal
jurisdiction will be required for air resources located within such reservation boundaries. EPA recognizes that
``other'' off-reservation areas may fall within Tribal jurisdiction. EPA is proposing to interpret the CAA as providing
no blanket grant of Federal authority for such areas. Thus, for off-reservation areas, a Tribe must demonstrate that
it has inherent authority over sources it seeks to regulate under general principles of Indian law.

The CAA authorizes EPA to protect air quality throughout Indian country. EPA intends to use this authority to remedy
and prevent gaps in CAA protection for Tribal air resources. EPA's authority to provide this CAA protection is based
in part on the general purpose of the Act, which is national in scope. As stated in section 101(b)(1) of the Act, Congress
intended to ``protect and enhance the quality of the

to include Indians and their property interests.''

Section 301(a) of the Act delegates to EPA broad authority to issue such regulations as are necessary to carry out the
functions of the Act. Further, several provisions of the Act call for Federal issuance of a program where, for example,
a State fails to adopt a program, adopts an inadequate program or fails to adequately implement a required program.

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
E.g., 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
sections 110(c) and 502 (d), (e), (i) of the Act. It follows that Congress intended that EPA would similarly have broad
legal authority in instances when Tribes choose not to develop a program, fail to adopt an adequate program or fail
to adequately implement an air program authorized under section 301(d). In addition, section 301(d)(4) of the CAA
empowers the Administrator to directly administer CAA requirements so as to achieve the appropriate purpose, where
Tribal implementation of CAA requirements is inappropriate or administratively infeasible. These provisions
evince Congressional intent to authorize EPA to directly implement CAA programs where Tribes fail to submit approvable
programs or lack authority to do so. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In fact, EPA is currently providing Federal support for CAA protection within reservations. For example, EPA administers
the permit program governing review of proposed new and modified major stationary sources of air pollution (``new
source review'' or ``NSR'') on Reservations and other areas in Indian country (hereafter ``Tribal lands''). There
are several reasons for this emphasis in the exercise of EPA's authority. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Many Tribal lands have air quality that presently meets the national ambient air quality standards (``NAAQS''),
and the central concern is to prevent the relatively clean air from significantly deteriorating. Thus, EPA has ensured
that major sources seeking to locate on Tribal lands obtain the Prevention of Significant Deterioration (``PSD'')
permit required under the CAA's NSR program. In broad overview, this program imposes limitations on the ambient air
quality impact of new or modified major stationary sources and requires the application of best available control
technology on such sources. See section 165 of the Act. Similarly, in those circumstances where the air quality on
Tribal lands currently is worse than the NAAQS, EPA's administration of the nonattainment NSR program prevents the
air quality from further deteriorating by ensuring that a proposed major source implements the most stringent control
technology (the ``lowest achievable emission rate'' as defined in section 171(3)) and offsets its emissions by obtaining
emissions reductions from nearby sources. Section 173 of the Act. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Owners and operators that construct air pollution sources on Tribal lands without first obtaining the proper permit
from EPA expose themselves to Federal enforcement action and citizen suits. For example, section 165 of the Act, 42
U.S.C. 7475, prohibits the construction of a major emitting facility that does not have a PSD permit. Section 173,
42 U.S.C. 7503, contains a similar requirement for new and modified major stationary sources in nonattainment areas.
Sections 113 and 167, 42 U.S.C. 7413 &amp; 7467, authorize EPA to take enforcement action (including, in certain instances,
criminal action) against an owner or operator that is in violation of the requirement to obtain a preconstruction
permit that meets the requirements of the Act. Furthermore, section 304 of the Act, 42 U.S.C. 7604, authorizes any
person to bring a ``citizen suit'' in U.S. district court against an owner or operator who constructs any new or modified
major stationary source without a PSD permit or nonattainment NSR permit that meets the Act's requirements.
