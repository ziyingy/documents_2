These requirements are based upon the 6-knot maneuvering characteristics of the tanker because this is the upper
speed limit at which conventional tugs can safely make connections to the tanker. However, the Coast Guard 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
recognizes that not all steering or propulsion failures will require immediate intervention by the escort vessels.
In many instances, there could be enough sea room in the waterway for the tanker to safely drift to a stop without 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
assistance from escort vessels. The regulations, therefore, allow a tanker to transit at any speed provided that
there is sufficient sea room to accommodate the disabled tanker's travel (advance and transfer) until it has naturally
slowed down to the speed where the escort vessels can move in and bring it under control. For example, a tanker can make
a transit at 10 knots if there is adequate sea room on both sides of its trackline to tolerate a locked rudder at that speed.
In a constrained waterway, however, or in adverse 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
weather conditions, prudent seamanship may require the tanker to reduce its transit speed, or expand the performance
capabilities of its escort vessels (such as by adding another escort vessel, pre-tethering, etc.), or both.

11. Other operational requirements.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 One comment concerning other operational requirements suggested that escort vessels be required to be pre-tethered
to a tanker before entering especially constrained waterways (the hazard presented by Middle Rock in Valdez Narrows
was specifically mentioned as an example). Although the Coast Guard agrees that, under certain conditions, pre-tethering
may be appropriate, it may not be necessary under other circumstances. Pre-tethering may entail a safety risk to the
escort vessel and its crew; it should be viewed as an option that the tanker and escort vessel masters may utilize after
discussing the sea and weather conditions at the anticipated time of transit. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Six comments on other operational requirements urged that specific speed limits be set as part of the regulations;
however, three comments disagreed. The Coast Guard also does not agree that specific speed limits are necessary because
&sect;168.50(a)(3) requires that a tanker not be operated beyond a speed at which the escort vessels can reasonably
be expected to safely bring the tanker under control.

12. Escort plans.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 The NPRM proposed that escort vessel operators prepare written information on the capabilities of their vessels
and submit the information to the local Coast Guard Captain of the Port (COTP) for review 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
and approval. The approved information would then be used by the tanker master to select escort vessels during the
pre-escort conference. Ten comments recommended requiring tanker-specific escort plans rather than escort vessel-specific
plans (on the argument that the appropriate approach to escort vessel selection must be based on the needs of the tanker
rather than the abilities of the escort vessels). Two comments suggested alternatives to selecting the escort vessels
at the pre-escort conference: one comment recommended that the Coast Guard COTP be responsible for prior approval
and designation, and the other comment recommended that each affected port establish a clearinghouse for certified
escort vessels. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Because the regulations contain specific performance criteria, and because the responsibility for selecting appropriate
escort vessels is on the tanker owners or operators, the Coast Guard has reconsidered its originally proposed requirement
for submittal and approval of written escort plans, and decided that there is no longer any need. Tanker and escort
vessel owners or operators can work together to match tanker needs with escort vessel capabilities without Coast
Guard participation. Tanker owners or operators can make arrangements for appropriate escort vessels in advance
of the tanker's arrival, and retain the flexibility of making those arrangements in several ways, such as pre-contracting,
establishing local clearinghouses of escort vessels, etc. Therefore, the NPRM's original requirement for submittal
of written escort plans has been deleted.

13. Pre-escort conference.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 The NPRM originally had two purposes for the pre-escort conference: (1) for the tanker master to determine the suitability
of the escort vessels (on the basis of written information submitted at the conference); and (2) a joint conference
for the tanker 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
master, pilot and escort vessel masters to discuss and plan the escort transit. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Eight comments were received concerning the pre-escort conference. In general, the comments agreed that it could
be used for exchanging safety and tactical information between the tanker master, pilot, and escort vessel masters.
One comment noted that the current briefing practice in Washington state is sufficient. However, four comments pointed
out that the conference, as proposed, would occur too late to actually select the escort vessels. Rejection of an escort
vessel at that point could lead to tanker delays and congestion while waiting for a replacement escort. They argued
that dispatching several escort vessels to meet a tanker, of which only two or three would be selected, would waste
the time and expense of the non-selected vessels. Two comments were concerned that lengthy pre-escort conferences
would similarly cause delays and congestion. Further, one of the comments indicated that this would cause undesirable
economic pressure for the vessel master and pilot. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Coast Guard recognizes that the pre-escort conference may be too late for selecting or rejecting the escort vessels.
As previously discussed in paragraph (4), escort vessel selection is now the responsibility of the tanker owner or
operators. This will allow them to make arrangements for appropriate escort vessels in advance of the tanker's arrival
(or departure, if outbound). 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Section 168.10 has been revised to reflect the changed responsibilities for selecting escort vessels and to state
more clearly the purpose of the conference and the topics to be discussed.

14. Additional mission requirements.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 Fourteen comments addressed additional mission requirements for the escort vessels, nominating firefighting,
salvage, lightering, and pollution response capabilities (the spill response capability of the Alyeska Pipeline
Service Company's Ship Escort and Response Vessel System (SERVS) vessels in escort service in Prince William Sound
were specifically mentioned). One comment stated that spill 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
containment and firefighting are excessive secondary functions that the escort should not be expected to perform.
The Coast Guard has determined that none of these capabilities can be easily retrofitted aboard the existing fleet
of tugs, which will make up the bulk of the escort vessel resources. This is because most tugs do not have sufficient
deck area to accommodate the additional mission equipment, nor sufficient above-water height (and associated stability)
to serve as effective firefighting platforms. However, the regulations do not preclude using vessels with such capabilities
if they are available.
