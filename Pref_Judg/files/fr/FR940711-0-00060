I. Background 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
This interim rule further implements section 213(d) of the Housing and Community Development Act of 1974, as amended,
42 U.S.C. 1439(d), so as to maximize flexibility in the provision of the Headquarters Reserve authorized under section
213(d)(4) of the Act. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Section 213(d)(4) permits the Secretary of HUD to retain not more than five percent of the financial assistance that
becomes available under all programs authorized under the United States Housing Act of 1937 (except for public housing
operating subsidy under section 9 and modernization funding under section 14). However, the current regulation
implementing the Headquarters Reserve at &sect;791.407 is more delimited. It only permits a Headquarters Reserve
of five percent of the total amount of budget authority which is ``fair shared'' pursuant to Part 791, Subpart D. The
effect of the regulatory limitation is to narrow considerably the base upon which the five percent reserve is calculated,
as compared to what the statute permits. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Under this interim rule, the base would be expanded by including not only the amount of funding which is fair shared
pursuant to the formula at &sect;791.403(b)(2), but also all budget authority allocated for uses that the Secretary
determines are incapable of geographic formula, as spelled out at &sect;791.403(b)(1). Examples of the latter category
include amendments of existing contracts, renewals of assistance contracts, the section 8 loan management and property
disposition accounts, assistance earmarked by the Congress in appropriation law line items, and uses of budget authority
identified in the Department's Operating Plan submitted to the Appropriations Committee. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Although the amount of funding available under the Headquarters Reserve will be increased by this interim rule, the
limited statutory purposes for which funding is permissible are maintained. Reserve funding can only be used for
unforeseen housing needs resulting from natural and other disasters; housing needs resulting from emergencies,
as certified by the Secretary, other than such disasters; housing needs resulting from the settlement of litigation;
and housing in support of desegregation efforts. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The tragedies of recent disasters are a highly visible predicate for this interim rule. The confluence in 1993 of Hurricane
Andrew, Hurricane Iniki, and Typhoon Omar and this year the Northridge earthquake in California have placed substantial
pressure on the Department to provide prompt, efficient assisted housing relief for disaster victims.
