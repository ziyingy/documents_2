<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 -->
The focus of today's action is reduction of HC emission as a 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
part of the solution to the ozone nonattainment problem. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
However, direct health effects are also a reason for concern due 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
to direct human exposure to emissions from small SI engines 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
during operation of equipment using such engines. Of specific 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
concern is the emission of air toxics. In some applications, the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
operator must be adjacent to the exhaust outlet and is in the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
direct path of the exhaust as it leaves the engine. Today's 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
regulations should be effective in reducing air toxics such as 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
benzene and 1,3-butadiene. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Based on data from the Nonroad Study, the exhaust and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
crankcase emissions from a 2.9 kW lawnmower with a 4-stroke 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
engine contain 3.5 grams of benzene per hour. Exhaust emission 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
of a 2.9 kW, 2-stroke lawnmower contains 17 grams of benzene per 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
hour. A small, 2.2 kW chainsaw emits 28.2 grams of benzene per 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
hour, compared to a large, 4.5 kW chainsaw that emits 40.8 grams 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
per hour. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Also, according to data from the Nonroad Study, 1,3- 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
butadiene content in exhaust and crankcase emissions from a 2.9 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
kW, 4-stroke lawnmower is approximately 1.5 grams per hour. For a 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
2.9 kW, 2-stroke lawnmower, 1,3-butadiene content in exhaust is 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
7.0 grams per hour. Butadiene emitted from a small, 2.2 kW 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
chainsaw is approximately 12.2 grams per hour, and is 17.7 grams 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
per hour from a large 4.5 kW chainsaw. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Benzene is a clear, colorless aromatic hydrocarbon which is 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
both volatile and flammable. Benzene is present in both exhaust 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
and evaporative emissions. Health effects caused by benzene 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
emissions differ based on concentration and duration of exposure. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
1,3-butadiene is a colorless, flammable gas at room 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
temperature. This suspected human carcinogen is insoluble in 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
water and its two conjugated double bonds make it highly 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
reactive. 1,3&hyph;Butadiene is formed in internal combustion engine 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
exhaust by the incomplete combustion of the fuel and is assumed 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
not present in evaporative and refueling emissions. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Since air toxic levels generally decrease in proportion to 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
overall emissions once emission control technology is applied, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the amount of benzene and 1,3-butadiene produced by new small SI 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
engines should diminish after this rule becomes effective. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Consequently, exposure to air toxics from new small SI engines 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
will be reduced, as will associated health effects. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
There is little data on direct health effects of small SI 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
engine emissions. No study has been conducted involving the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
health effects of air toxic emissions specifically from small SI 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
engines. The Agency requests additional information on this 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
topic.

C. Health and Welfare Effects of CO Emissions 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 -->
Carbon monoxide (CO) is a colorless, odorless gas which can 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
be emitted into ambient air as a result of both natural processes 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
and human activity. Although CO exists as a trace element in the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
troposphere, much of human exposure resulting in elevated levels 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
of carboxyhemoglobin (COHb) in the blood is due to incomplete 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
fossil fuel combustion, as occurs in small SI engines. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The concentration and direct health effect of CO exposure 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
are especially important in small SI engines because the operator 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
of a small SI engine application is typically near the equipment 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
as it functions. In some applications, the operator must be 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
adjacent to the exhaust outlet and is in the direct path of the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
exhaust as it leaves the engine. According to numbers published 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
in the Nonroad Study, a 4-stroke, 2.9 kW lawnmower engine emits 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
1051.1 g/hr CO, while a 2-stroke, 2.9 kW engine emits 1188.4 g/hr 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
CO. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Although no studies measuring the human health effects of CO 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
emanating from small SI engine exhaust have been conducted, ample 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
research results are available concerning general health effects 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
of exposure to CO. The toxicity of CO effects on blood and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
tissues, and how these effects manifest themselves as organ 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
function changes have been topics of substantial research 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
efforts. However, most of these involved higher, more constant 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
exposure concentration levels of CO than are likely to be 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
produced under normal operations of these small SI engines. Such 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
studies provided information for establishing the National 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Ambient Air Quality Standard for CO. The current primary and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
secondary NAAQS for CO are 9 parts per million for the one-hour 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
average and 35 parts per million for the eight-hour average.

effective means of reducing ozone concentration. In a recent

E. Health and Welfare Effects of Tropospheric Ozone 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
EPA's primary reason for controlling emissions from small 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
SI engines is the role of HC in forming ozone. Of the major air 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
pollutants for which NAAQS have been designated under the CAA, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the most widespread problem continues to be ozone, which is the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
most prevalent photochemical oxidant and an important component 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
of smog. Ozone is a product of the atmospheric chemical 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
reactions involving oxides of nitrogen and other compounds. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
These reactions occur as atmospheric oxygen and sunlight interact 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
with hydrocarbons and oxides of nitrogen from both mobile and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
stationary sources. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
A critical part of this problem is the formation of ozone 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
both in and downwind of large urban areas. Under certain weather 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
conditions, the combination of NO
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=2 -->
X
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 and HC can result in urban and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
rural areas exceeding the national ambient ozone standard by a 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
factor of three. The ozone NAAQS represents the maximum level 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
considered protective of public health by the EPA.
