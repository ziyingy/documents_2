Another question raised by several commenters regards products intended for export. Commenters asked whether engine
manufacturers can continue to produce noncertified engines for export, and whether noncertified engines may be
imported for use in nonroad vehicles and equipment intended for export. One commenter requested an exemption from
liability for engine and equipment manufacturers if nonroad vehicles or equipment sold for export are used in the
U.S.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
This regulation does not prohibit import of noncertified engines for use in nonroad vehicles and equipment intended
for export. As originally proposed, the exemption for repair and alteration in 40 CFR 89.611&hyph;96(b)(1) will
allow the import under bond of noncertified engines for use in vehicles and equipment intended for export. Further,
this regulation does not prohibit the manufacture of noncertified engines intended for export. Manufacture of noncertified
engines intended for export is allowed under the conditions specified in 40 CFR 89.909&hyph;96(a), as originally
proposed. EPA is not providing a blanket exemption from liability for nonroad manufacturers whose products, intended
for export, are used in the U.S. Such manufacturers may, in fact, be liable for sanctions. Each case must be determined
on its own merits.

Q. Alternative Fuels

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The Agency proposed that the use of alternative fuels would not be necessary to comply with the emission standards,
but allowed any manufacturer wanting to use alternative fuels to petition the Administrator for approval of alternative
test procedures appropriate for that fuel. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Two commenters addressed alternative fuels. One argued that alternative-fueled CI engines should be exempt from
regulation because of increased costs and increased competition with non-CI alternative-fueled engines. The other
commenter stated that EPA should include all natural gas engines in this regulation, establish better test procedures
as soon as possible, and allow these engines to certify to the same standards. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
EPA will adopt as proposed its provisions to include alternative fuel CI engines. No data were provided to support
any of the statements made by commenters. EPA still believes that including alternative fuel engines is appropriate.
Any additional cost for these engines to certify is small and comparable to that of diesel fueled engines. EPA reserves
the right to adjust standards when necessary, such as adjusting the HC standard to its non-methane equivalent, for
certain alternative fuels.

R. Selective Enforcement Auditing 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
EPA received a number of comments on its proposed Selective Enforcement Auditing (SEA) program for large nonroad
CI engines. The proposed nonroad SEA program was designed to be similar to the existing on-highway program for heavy-duty
motor vehicle engines, with some modifications to accommodate differences between the two industries. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Comments indicate that industry understands EPA's need for the SEA program, but concern was expressed regarding
EPA's proposed changes from the on-highway program to adapt to the large nonroad CI engine industry. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
EPA proposed to determine annual limits for the number of SEAs a manufacturer would receive. Each passing audit counts
as one toward a manufacturer's annual limit. EPA's on-highway light-duty vehicle (LDV), light-duty truck (LDT)
and heavy-duty engine (HDE) programs determine annual limits by dividing a manufacturer's projected annual production
by 300,000 for LDV and LDT manufacturers and 30,000 for HDE manufacturers, then rounding to the nearest whole number.
If the calculated production factor is less than one, the figure is set at one for that manufacturer. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
To compensate for differences between the on-highway and nonroad industries, EPA proposed that nonroad engine manufacturers'
annual limits would be determined by first calculating two annual limit factors, the production factor and the family
factor. These factors respectively represent the maximum number of audits based on yearly annual sales and on the
number of engine families produced in that model year. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The production factor was derived from the annual limits currently used in the on-highway SEA programs and the relative
contributions of emissions from on-highway and nonroad sources. EPA proposed that the production factor should
be the projected annual nonroad engine sales of each manufacturer divided by 9,500 and rounded to the nearest whole
number. If the calculated production factor is less than one, the figure is set at one for that manufacturer. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The family factor was proposed as an alternative method to compensate for situations where manufacturers may have
low production but a large number of engine families. EPA proposed that the family factor would be determined by dividing
the number of engine families certified by the manufacturer in a given model year by five and rounding to the nearest
whole number. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
EPA proposed to use whichever value is higher of either the production factor or the family factor as the annual limit
of SEAs for a manufacturer. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Manufacturers commented that EPA was putting a larger SEA burden on nonroad manufacturers than on on-highway manufacturers.
They recommended eliminating the family factor and that annual limits be determined, as in the on-highway HDE SEA
program, by dividing by 30,000 and rounding to the nearest whole number. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Annual limits were also discussed at the public hearing for this rule on June 30, 1993. At that time EPA expressed concern
that if a manufacturer were assigned an annual limit of one, and that manufacturer passed an SEA early in the model year,
the incentive to maintain close control over emissions may decrease or the desire to establish very low emission limits
to maximize credits in an averaging program might increase the risk of noncompliance. Similarly, the manufacturer
could modify its production to increase emissions with the knowledge that no more SEAs would likely be assigned during
that model year.
