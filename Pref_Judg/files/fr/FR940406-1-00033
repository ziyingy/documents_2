, NHTSA is establishing light truck average fuel economy standards for model years 1996 and 1997. The purpose of this
advance notice is to announce that the agency is beginning to develop a proposal for light truck average fuel economy
standards for model years after 1997, and to request comments to assist the agency in developing the proposal. NHTSA
plans to propose standards for some or all of model years 1998 to 2006. The agency is seeking information that will help
it assess the extent to which manufacturers can improve light truck fuel economy during the period in question, the
benefits and costs to consumers of improved fuel economy, the benefits to the nation of reducing fuel consumption,
and the number of model years that should be covered by the proposal.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
In December 1975, Congress enacted the Energy Policy and Conservation Act (EPCA) because of a national concern with
the depletable nature and uncertain availability of most of the energy upon which the Nation relies for its economic
and social well being, and the need to implement a national program for conserving energy. Among other things, EPCA
added Title V, ``Improving Automotive Efficiency,'' to the Motor Vehicle Information and Cost Savings Act (Cost
Savings Act). Title V provides for the establishment of corporate average fuel economy (CAFE) standards for passenger
cars and light trucks. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
While Title V provides that the CAFE standard for passenger cars is 27.5 mpg for each model year after model year (MY)
1984 unless NHTSA amends it, the statute does not specify any particular level of light truck CAFE standards. Instead,
Title V requires the agency to set light truck CAFE standards for each model year, at least 18 months before the beginning
of the model year. In a final rule published elsewhere in today's edition of the 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 -->
Federal Register
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
, NHTSA is establishing light truck CAFE standards for MYs 1996 and 1997 at 20.7 mpg. The final rule follows a notice
of proposed rulemaking (NPRM) published by the agency in the 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 -->
Federal Register
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 (57 FR 61377) on December 24, 1992. That NPRM did not address standards for model years after 1997. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
With the rulemaking for the MYs 1996&hyph;1997 light truck CAFE standards completed, NHTSA is turning its attention
to developing a proposal for light truck average fuel economy standards for model years after MY 1997. While the agency
has in the last decade set light truck CAFE standards for only one or two model years at a time, it believes that it may
be appropriate now to set standards for a much longer period, i.e., for some or all of the period including MYs 1998 to
2006. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Since the early 1980's, NHTSA has established light truck CAFE standards as little as 18 months and not more than 30
months before the beginning of the model year. The effect of this practice has been to limit the CAFE increases that
could be required because there was insufficient leadtime for the manufacturers to change their product plans and
improve their light truck fuel economy by means of significant technological improvements. In this period, the light
truck CAFE standard changed very little. For MY 1984, it was 20 mpg; for MY 1994, it is 20.5 mpg. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
NHTSA explained the impact of such limited leadtime as follows in its December 1992 NPRM to establish the MYs 1995&hyph;97
light truck CAFE standards:

<!-- PJG QTAG 04 -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->
NHTSA recognizes that the leadtime necessary to implement significant improvements in engines, transmissions,
aerodynamics and rolling resistance is typically at least three years. Also, *&blank;*&blank;* once a new design
is established and tested as feasible for production, the leadtime necessary to design tools and test components
is typically 30 to 36 months. Some potential major changes may take even longer. Leadtimes for new vehicles are usually
at least three years. Further, light trucks have a long model life, i.e., 8&hyph;10 years or more. If a manufacturer
must make a major model change ahead of its normal schedule, this change may have a significant, unprogrammed impact.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Given the leadtime constraints, the agency does not believe that manufacturers can achieve significant improvements
in their projected CAFE levels for these model years by additional technological actions.
