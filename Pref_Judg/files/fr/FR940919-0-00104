EPA's review of IMWIR data indicates that 4,000 m

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 of treatment capacity are available annually for HLW at three DOE treatment systems. The available capacity appears
sufficient to treat the estimated average annual generation. However, the IMWIR indicates that the current national
inventory of HLW is greater than 280,000 m
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=1 -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
. This quantity dwarfs DOE's annual available treatment capacity for HLW. Consequently, DOE faces a treatment capacity
shortfall for high-level radioactive wastes. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
DOE is developing the Waste Isolation Pilot Project (WIPP) in New Mexico as a permanent repository for DOE TRU wastes,
including MTRU wastes. However, DOE is not yet authorized to begin the placement of TRU wastes in the WIPP. In addition,
wastes received at the WIPP must meet DOE's WIPP Waste Acceptance Criteria (WIPP&hyph;WAC). DOE is still in the planning
stages for facilities designed to prepare MTRU wastes for shipment to the WIPP. As a result, DOE faces a capacity shortfall
for treatment of MTRU wastes. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
EPA's review of the IMWIR data indicates that 340 m

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
/yr of currently available capacity exists at four DOE treatment systems for the treatment of alpha MLLW (i.e., MLLW
with an alpha particle content between 10 and 100 nCi/g). However, the available capacity is greatly exceeded by the
estimated quantity of alpha MLLW requiring treatment annually over the next five years, 3,700 m
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=1 -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
. Consequently, DOE faces a treatment capacity shortfall for non-soil, non-debris alpha MLLW. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
According to IMWIR, 1,000,000 m

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
/yr of treatment capacity among 26 systems are currently available to treat non-alpha MLLW. However, IMWIR states
that most of DOE's currently available treatment capacity for MLLW is represented by facilities limited to the treatment
of wastewaters (defined by DOE as less than 1 percent total suspended solids (TSS)). While these treatment facilities
provide excess capacity for MLLW wastewaters, they cannot process wastes with high TSS and are not readily adaptable
for other waste forms. Thus, although the quantity of MLLW treatment capacity is greater than the total quantity of
mixed wastes, DOE faces a treatment capacity shortfall for nonwastewater MLLW, and thus non-alpha MLLW. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
 While DOE has provided its best available data on mixed waste generation, uncertainty remains about mixed waste generation
at DOE (and non-DOE) facilities. For example, not all DOE Field Organizations responded to DOE's request for information
following publication of the ANPRM. In addition, the data submitted to EPA generally did not include DOE environmental
restoration wastes which, when generated, will increase the quantity of newly identified mixed wastes that require
treatment. The IMWIR estimates that DOE will generate a total of 600,000 m
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=1 -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 of mixed environmental restoration wastes over the period from 1993 to 1997. Although the IMWIR notes that the estimates
of DOE environmental restoration wastes are preliminary, the quantities noted above will place additional strains
on DOE's limited available mixed waste treatment capacity. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Although DOE is in the process of increasing its capacity to manage mixed RCRA/radioactive wastes, information supplied
by DOE indicates that a significant capacity shortfall currently exists for the treatment of mixed RCRA/radioactive
wastes, much of which are in storage facilities awaiting treatment. DOE has indicated that it will generally give
treatment priority to mixed wastes that are already restricted under previous LDR rules (e.g., radioactive wastes
mixed with solvents, dioxins, California list wastes, First Third, Second Third, or Third Third wastes, and Phase
I wastes). DOE is also concerned about the availability of treatment capacity for mixed wastes that will be generated
as a result of site remediation activities. EPA's review of non-DOE data sources also showed a significant lack of
commercial treatment capacity. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In response to the Phase II proposed rule, EPA received six comments concerning the proposal to grant a two-year national
capacity variance for non-soil, non-debris TC organic mixed radioactive wastes. All six commenters, including
DOE, were in favor of the two-year national capacity variance. Furthermore, none of the commenters identified any
additional treatment capacity for the wastes. Thus, despite the uncertainty about the exact quantities of mixed
radioactive wastes containing newly listed and identified wastes that will require treatment as a result of today's
rule, the quantities appear to exceed available capacity. In addition, any new commercial capacity that does become
available will be needed for mixed radioactive wastes that were regulated in previous LDR rulemakings and whose variances
have already expired. Therefore, EPA has determined that sufficient alternative treatment capacity is not available
for mixed radioactive wastes contaminated with newly listed and identified wastes whose standards are being promulgated
today, and thus is granting a two-year national capacity variance for these wastes.

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
EPA's review of IMWIR data indicates that no available treatment capacity exists at DOE facilities for mixed radioactive
soils. As indicated earlier, a preliminary estimate of mixed radioactive soil is approximately 10 m
