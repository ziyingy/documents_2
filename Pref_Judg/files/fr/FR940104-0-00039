In 1992, the CDFG estimated that the winter-run chinook salmon run size increased to 1,180 fish. This run size was substantially
higher than the runs estimated in 1989 (547 fish), 1990 (441 fish), and 1991 (191 fish), and it represented more than
a 100 percent increase in the spawning population in a single successive generation since the 1992 run was comprised
primarily of the surviving progeny from the 1989 run. In 1989, the Bureau implemented conservation measures to manage
upper Sacramento River water temperatures and provide improved fish passage at the Red Bluff. As a result of these
actions, temperature conditions were much improved with favorable water temperatures occurring from Keswick Dam
to Bend Bridge (44 miles downstream) during almost the entire spawning and egg incubation period. Spawning ground
surveys in 1989 also indicated that nearly 100 percent of the estimated run spawned in this 44-mile river reach where
water temperature was favorable. As a result of these factors, temperature-related mortality was minimal in 1989.
The substantial increase in the 1992 run size suggests that the measures implemented to protect winter-run chinook
salmon in 1989 were effective, and that similar or more protective measures may be successful in the future.

In 1993, the CDFG estimated the winter-run chinook salmon run size to be 341 fish. This represented nearly a 30 percent
decline of the run size in one generation. NMFS had anticipated that the run size would likely decline in 1993 because
the 1990 spawning population (441 fish) experienced less favorable water temperature conditions during spawning
and egg incubation, and more of the run spawned downstream from the river reach where temperatures could be suitably
managed by the Bureau. In 1990, as a result of continued drought conditions and high ambient temperatures, favorable
water temperatures for spawning and egg incubation were present only from Keswick Dam to the Balls Ferry Bridge (26
miles downstream) during a portion of the egg incubation period. In addition, spawning distribution surveys indicated
that nearly 10 percent of the run spawned downstream from Balls Ferry where temperatures were not favorable. Therefore,
temperature-related mortality was substantially higher in 1990 than in 1989. In addition to less favorable temperature
conditions, it is possible that conditions for outmigrants were less than favorable, and that ocean survival of the
1990 year class was reduced by the El Nino event that began in 1991&hyph;92.

Since the winter-run chinook salmon was formally listed as threatened in November 1990 (55 FR 46515), the species
run size has continued to decline, with the exception of 1992, and exhibit considerable variability (Table 1). Although
some protective measures were implemented beginning in 1987, this decline was exacerbated by the 6-year drought
in California (1987&hyph;1992). Based on the run size estimates for the last 3 years (1991&hyph;1993), the population
now has two weak year classes (1991 and 1993). NMFS expects that the 1994 run will also be weak because of the weak 1991
year class (191 fish) and the less than favorable conditions for spawning, egg incubation, and juvenile outmigration
that occurred in 1991&hyph;92. Because of the small run in 1991 and the weak return expected in 1994, this year class
is likely to remain weakened for some time.

As part of the status review, extinction probabilities were estimated for the winter-run chinook salmon population
using modifications of the model described by Dennis, Munholland, and Scott (1991), and the 3-year geometric moving
average of the annual estimated run size for the periods of 1967&hyph;1993 and 1979 1993, respectively. Results of
the analysis indicate that if past trends continue, the population faces a high probability of dropping below 100
spawners per year at least once over the next 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
10 years, and to even lower levels over the 50 and 100 year time horizons. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The extinction modeling results suggest that the risk of the winter-run chinook salmon population dropping to unacceptably
low levels is high. However, this type of analysis is based only on historical trends in the population (1967&hyph;1993)
and assumes that past conditions will continue in the future. Although the 1994 run is expected to be weak, NMFS believes
that conditions for winter-run chinook salmon were substantially improved in 1992 and 1993 because of long-term
protective measures implemented to reduce impacts of Central Valley and State Water Project operations and improve
conditions for successful egg incubation, rearing, and outmigration, and the end of the drought. In addition to these
protective measures, the FWS has been supplementing the natural production of juveniles with substantial numbers
of hatchery produced fish. If these protective measures and supplementation efforts prove to be effective, run sizes
in 1995 and 1996 will likely increase. For these reasons, the probability of the population declining to low levels
is probably less than suggested by the extinction modeling analysis. However, because the effectiveness of these
recently implemented protective measures and supplementation efforts is unknown and cannot be assessed until future
runs return, there remains substantial risk that the population is in danger of extinction.

The World Wildlife Fund supported the reclassification and also encouraged NMFS to develop and implement a recovery
plan for the conservation of Sacramento River winter-run chinook salmon. The Department of the Interior (Interior)
also supported the reclassification of winter-run chinook salmon, and said the population remained at depressed
levels and may be in danger of extinction after the next two runs. However, Interior noted that the 1989 year class survived
particularly well and that the resulting 1992 run size of 1,180 adults represented more than a 100 percent increase
in size in a single successive generation. Interior also acknowledged that the 1992 increase in run size may indicate
that measures taken to protect the population in recent years may be effective. Interior also provided technical
comments to clarify and update facts contained in the proposed rule.

The Westlands Water District, the Family Water Alliance, and the Glenn County Board of Supervisors all opposed reclassifying
winter-run chinook salmon because of protective measures that have been recently implemented. They said that the
threatened status should be retained until the effectiveness of these measures has been assessed.
