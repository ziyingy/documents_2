The nervous system is dependent on an extensive system of blood vessels and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
capillaries to deliver large quantities of oxygen and nutrients as well as to remove toxic waste 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
products. Damage to the capillaries in the brain can lead to the swelling characteristic of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
encephalopathy. This can be seen following exposure to higher concentrations of lead. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Other metals (e.g., cadmium, thallium, and mercury) and organotin (e.g., trimethyltin) cause 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
rupturing of vessels that can also result in encephalopathy. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
One large aspect of function that may be affected by neurotoxicants is behavior, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
which is the product of various sensory, motor, and associative functions of the nervous 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
system. Neurotoxic substances can adversely affect sensory or motor functions, disrupt 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
learning and memory processes, or cause detrimental behavioral effects; however, the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
underlying mechanisms for these effects have yet to be determined. Although changes may 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
be subtle, the assessment of behavior may serve as a robust means of monitoring the well-being of the organism (Tilson
and Cabe, 1978).

2.5.1. Susceptible Populations 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Everyone is at a certain level of risk of being adversely affected by neurotoxic 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
substances. Individuals of certain age groups, health states, and occupations, however, may 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
be at a greater level of risk. Fetuses, children, the elderly, workers in occupations involving 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
exposure to relatively high levels of toxic chemicals, and persons who abuse drugs are 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
among those in high-risk groups. Neurotoxic substances may exacerbate existing 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
neurological or psychiatric disorders in a population. Although controversial (Waddell, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
1993), recent evidence suggests that there may be a subpopulation of people who have 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
become sensitive to chemicals and experience adverse reactions to low-level exposures to 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
environmental chemicals (Bell, et al., 1992). Confounded in all of these groups is the role 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
that nutrition plays in the response of the organism to exposure. Both general nutritional 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
status and specific nutritional deficiencies (for example, protein, iron, and calcium) can 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
significantly influence the response to a toxic substance. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
It is widely accepted that during development adverse effects can result from exposure 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
to some chemicals at lower levels than would be necessary for the average adult (Suzuki, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
1980). The developing nervous system appears to be differentially sensitive to some kinds of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
damage (Cushner, 1981; Pearson and Dietrich, 1985; Annau and Eccles, 1986; Hill and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Tennyson, 1986; Silbergeld, 1986). During the developmental period, the nervous system is 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
actively growing and establishing intricate cellular networks. Both the blood-brain and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
blood-nerve barriers that will eventually protect much of the adult brain, spinal cord, and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
peripheral nerves are incomplete. The protective mechanisms by which the organism deals 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
with toxic substances, such as the detoxification systems, are not fully developed. Exposure 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
to chemicals during development can result in a range of effects. At the highest exposure, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
effects include death, gross structural abnormalities, or altered growth. Larger populations 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
are generally exposed to more moderate levels resulting in more subtle functional 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
impairments. The qualitative nature of some injuries during development may differ from 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
those seen in the adult, such as changes in tissue volume, misplaced or misoriented neurons, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
or delays or acceleration of the appearance of functional or structural endpoints (Rodier, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
1986). In many cases, the results of early injuries may become evident only as the nervous 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
system matures and ages (Rodier, 1990). There are several instances in which functional 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
alterations have resulted from exposure during the period between conception and sexual 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
maturity (Riley and Vorhees, 1986; Vorhees, 1987). 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Early exposure to relatively low levels of lead can result in reduced scores on tests of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
mental development (Bellinger et al., 1987; Needleman, 1990). Early gestational exposure 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
to neurotoxicants such as cocaine can produce long-term neurobehavioral abnormalities 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(Anderson-Brown et al., 1990; Hutchings et al., 1989); heavy alcohol exposure produces 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
craniofacial abnormalities and mental retardation (Jones and Smith, 1973), while moderate 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
levels of alcohol consumption during gestation can delay motor development (Little et al., 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
1989). 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
With aging, the level of risk for a number of health-related factors increases; it has 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
been hypothesized that the risk for toxic perturbations to the nervous system also increases 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
with age (Weiss, 1990). It is generally believed that with increasing age comes a decreased 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
ability of the nervous system to respond to adverse events or to compensate for either 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
biological, physical, or toxic effects. At the tissue and cellular level, the aging process can 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
result in nerve cell loss, formation of neurofibrillary tangles (abnormal accumulation of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
certain filamentous proteins) and neuritic plaques (abnormal clusters of proteins and other 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
substances near synapses). As cells die, the complex neuronal circuitry of the brain becomes 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
impaired. Neurotransmitter concentrations and the enzymes involved in their synthesis may 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
be altered. Some axons can gradually lose their myelin sheath, resulting in a slowed 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
conduction of nerve impulses along the axon. It has been postulated that with age, not only 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
might the nervous system become more susceptible to new insults, but the effects of previous 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
exposures also may become evident, with a diminished capacity for compensation (Weiss, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
1990). The increased incidence of multiple drug-taking in the elderly population might also 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
lead to interactions, either drug/drug or drug/chemical, which can adversely affect the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
nervous system. Nutritionally, the aged experience increased incidences of both general 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
undernutrition and deficits of specific nutrients such as iron or calcium, which might 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
influence the response to toxic substances. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In the geriatric population, the clinical manifestation of neurodegenerative disorders 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
may have a contributing component of past exposures to environmental chemical agents. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Calne et al. (1986) hypothesized that various agents contribute to Alzheimer's disease, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Parkinson's disease, or amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS, motoneurone disease, or Lou 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Gehrig's disease) by depleting neuronal reserves to an extent that perturbations become 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
observable in the context of the natural aging process. B-N-methylamino-L-alanine, from the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
seed of the false sago palm (

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Cycas circinalis 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
L.), has been reported to induce a form of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (Spencer et al., 1987). Alzheimer-type syndromes have been 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
reported in individuals occupationally exposed to organic solvents or metal vapors (Freed and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Kandel, 1988). Severe cognitive dysfunction has been noted in Alzheimer's disease and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
aluminum intoxication (Yokel et al., 1988).
