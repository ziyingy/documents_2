On test days, extensive aerial and surface surveillance will be conducted to monitor for the presence, behavior and
condition of marine mammals before and after each detonation. Pre- and post-detonation aerial reconnaissance surveys
will be conducted from a fixed-wing aircraft, Navy helicopters, and from the test vessel. If marine mammals, sea turtles,
or endangered or threatened seabirds are seen within the 2-nm (3.7-km)-radius safety zone (for the 10,000-lb. (4,536-kg)
charge), detonation of the charge will be delayed until the animals exit the safety zone. Tests will not be conducted
if marine mammals, sea turtles, seabird flocks or fish schools are detected within the safety zone. Also, tests will
not be conducted when weather or sea conditions preclude adequate aerial surveillance. No detonations will be permitted
without the concurrence of the NAWC Ecologist assigned to the program as the Environmental Coordinator. Any dead
marine mammals and turtles seen by aerial survey observers during the pre-test (48 hours prior to test) aerial survey
of one or more of the three 80-nm2 (275-km2) will be documented and marked/tagged by MART, onboard an independent recovery
vessel, so that those animals that were dead prior to the ship shock test will not be included in incidental take numbers
reported to NMFS after the trial. Full necropsies will not be performed on these animals, although tissues may be collected
if time permits.

After each detonation, an aerial reconnaissance survey of the ship shock test zone, to 3 nm (5.6 km) radial distance
from the detonation, will be conducted by NMFS SWFSC scientists who will notify the MART personnel if any dead or injured
marine animals are seen. The occurrence of live marine mammals, seabirds and sea turtles will also be documented by
aerial and vessel survey personnel. Under the direction of a Navy marine mammal veterinarian, examination and recovery
of any dead or injured animals will be undertaken by MART. Necropsies will be performed and tissue samples taken by
MART's veterinary staff from any dead marine mammals or sea turtles. Activities related to the monitoring of the Navy
ship shock program will be authorized under these regulations and will not require a separate permit under section
104 of the MMPA.

If post-test surveys determine that an injurious or lethal take of a marine mammal has occurred, the test procedure
and the monitoring methods will be reviewed by the Navy and NMFS and appropriate changes may be made. Inter-agency
coordination between the Navy and NMFS/SWFSC will ensure that the tests will proceed by the safest possible means.

Within 90 days after any detonation project, the Navy will have to submit a summary report to NMFS. This report must
include the following information: (1) Date and time of the test; (2) a summary of the pre-test and post-test activities
related to mitigating and monitoring the effects of explosives detonation on marine mammal populations; and (3)
the results of the monitoring program, including numbers by species/stock of any marine mammals noted injured or
killed as a result of the detonation and numbers that may have been harassed due to presence within the safety zone.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
An annual report must be submitted by the Navy to NMFS at least 120 days prior to the date of expiration of the annual LOA
in order for issuance of a LOA for the following year. This annual report must contain: (1) The date and time of all tests
conducted during the previous calendar year; (2) a description of all pre-test and post-test activities related
to mitigating and monitoring the effects of explosives detonation on marine mammal populations; (3) the results
of the post-test monitoring program, including numbers by species/stock of any marine mammals noted injured or killed
as a result of the detonation and numbers that may have been harassed due to presence within the safety zone; and (4)
the results of population assessment studies conducted by Navy or contract scientists, if any, made on marine mammals
in the SCB during the previous year.

NMFS will renew the LOA annually upon timely receipt of the summary and annual reports, a determination that the maximum
incidental take authorizations were not exceeded, and that the mitigation measures were undertaken. If one or more
species' lethal or serious injury take levels were reached or exceeded during the previous year, NMFS will require
the holder of the LOA to provide additional documentation, as may be requested, on the taking, including the results
of the required reviews of the ship shock test procedure and the monitoring methods and any measures that will be undertaken
in the following year to prevent exceeding the authorized incidental take levels in the future. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
NMFS will review these reports and if it is determined that the taking may be having more than a negligible impact on
any species, or if the methods of taking, monitoring, or reporting are not being substantially complied with, NMFS
shall, under &sect;228.6(e), and after notice and comment in the
