(b) DOL shall prescribe the frequency with which performance reports shall be submitted. Except as provided in paragraph
(f) of this section, performance reports shall not be required more frequently than quarterly or, less frequently
than annually. Annual reports shall be due 90 calendar days after the grant year; quarterly or semi-annual reports
shall be due 30 days after the reporting period. DOL may require annual reports before the anniversary dates of multiple-year
awards in lieu of these requirements. The final performance reports are due 90 calendar days after the expiration
or termination of the award. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(c) If inappropriate, a final technical or performance report shall not be required after completion of the project.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(d) When required, performance reports shall generally contain, for each award, brief information on each of the
following: 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(1) A comparison of actual accomplishments with the goals and objectives established for the period, the findings
of the investigator, or both. Whenever appropriate and the output of programs or projects can be readily quantified,
such quantitative data should be related to cost data for computation of unit costs. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(2) Reasons why established goals were not met, if appropriate. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(3) Other pertinent information including, when appropriate, analysis and explanation of cost overruns or high
unit costs. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(e) Recipients shall not be required to submit more than the original and two copies of performance reports. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(f) Recipients shall immediately notify DOL of developments that have a significant impact on the award-supported
activities. Also, notification shall be given in the case of problems, delays, or adverse conditions which materially
impair the ability to meet the objectives of the award. This notification shall include a statement of the action taken
or contemplated, and any assistance needed to resolve the situation. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

Financial reporting.

(a) The following forms or such other forms as may be approved by OMB are authorized for obtaining financial information
from recipients: 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(1) SF&hyph;269 or SF&hyph;269A, Financial Status Report. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
 (i) Recipients shall use the SF&hyph;269, SF&hyph;269A, or other OMB-approved forms to report the status of funds
for all nonconstruction projects or programs. DOL may, however, have the option of not requiring the SF&hyph;269
or SF&hyph;269A when the SF&hyph;270, Request for Advance or Reimbursement, or SF&hyph;272, Report of Federal Cash
Transactions, is determined to provide adequate information to meet its needs, except that a final SF&hyph;269 or
SF&hyph;269A shall be required at the completion of the project when the SF&hyph;270 is used only for advances. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
 (ii) DOL shall prescribe whether the report shall be on a cash or an accrual basis. If DOL requires accrual information
and the recipient's accounting records are not normally kept on the accrual basis, the recipient shall not convert
its accounting system, but shall develop such accrual information through best estimates based on an analysis of
the documentation on hand. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
 (iii) DOL shall determine the frequency of the Financial Status Report for each project or program, considering the
size and complexity of the particular project or program. However, the report shall not be required more frequently
than quarterly or less frequently than annually. A final report shall be required at the completion of the agreement.
