However, as in other motor vehicle fuel regulatory programs, EPA intends to exercise its enforcement discretion
and not seek to hold liable parties meeting a definition in relation to a batch of gasoline that chose to jointly meet
the requirements of the final rule. In practice, therefore, each requirement pertaining to an individual batch of
gasoline must be met only once. For example, the determination of properties, independent sampling and testing,
compliance audits, testing of RBOB, record keeping and reporting requirements, and oxygenate blender quality assurance
programs need not be met separately by each person who meets the refiner or oxygenate blender definition with respect
to a specific batch of gasoline or blendstock. Rather, within the exercise of EPA's enforcement discretion, each
party is individually responsible for ensuring that each requirement is met at least once for any specific batch.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
For example, EPA would exercise its enforcement discretion and not seek to impose liability on a party that meets the
definition of oxygenate blender that does not separately sample and test the gasoline produced or separately submit
reports to EPA relating to a specific batch of gasoline, as long as some party with equivalent standing (an oxygenate
blender) does conduct the required sampling and testing and does file a valid annual report. However, each person
meeting the definition of oxygenate blender in this example is individually responsible that the required sampling
and testing occurs and that the required reports to EPA are submitted. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
EPA anticipates that the people involved in a refining or oxygenate blending operation will discuss among themselves
who will be responsible for each of the regulatory requirements. In most cases, EPA anticipates that the product owner
will take the lead in satisfying requirements, though the allocation of these responsibilities is strictly within
the province of the regulated parties involved. If a refinery or oxygenate blending facility requirement is accomplished
by one person, EPA will consider the requirement to have been accomplished by each person who meets the definition
of refiner or oxygenate blender. If a refinery or oxygenate blending facility requirement is not properly accomplished,
however, EPA will consider the lapse to be a violation by each person who meets the definition of refiner or oxygenate
blender. Similarly, if a standard applicable to the refinery or oxygenate blending facility is not satisfied, EPA
will consider each person who meets the definition of refiner or oxygenate blender to have failed to satisfy the relevant
standard.

EPA anticipates that reformulated gasoline and RBOB will be produced exclusively, or almost exclusively, at the
refinery at which the blendstocks are produced from crude oil, due to the complexities inherent in producing reformulated
gasoline and RBOB. EPA believes it will be very difficult for a downstream party to obtain blendstocks with the specific
mixtures of properties such that the blendstocks may be blended together to produce gasoline meeting the standards
for reformulated gasoline or RBOB. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
However, if such downstream blending-refining does occur, all requirements attaching to refiners apply to all parties
meeting the definition of a ``refiner''. Note that, if blendstocks are combined with reformulated gasoline, the
reformulated gasoline standards must be met on the basis of the volume and properties of the blendstocks only and compliance
may not rely on the properties of the reformulated gasoline to which the blendstock is added. In addition the resulting
reformulated gasoline/blendstock mixture must meet all reformulated gasoline standards. In the event any party
attempts downstream blending-refining of reformulated gasoline or RBOB, EPA intends to scrutinize the operation
closely. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Commenters expressed concern that, where the oxygen standard is being met on an average basis, all persons who satisfy
the oxygenate blender definition may not have access to the information necessary to know that this standard is being
met in fact. This issue was of particular concern for oxygenate blenders who are carriers, where the normal business
practice is to blend oxygenate according to the instructions of the product owner-oxygenate blender.

The final rule provides that oxygenate blenders will be held liable,

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
inter alia,
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 for reformulated gasoline produced for averaged compliance that is determined to exceed the minimum and/or maximum
standards. The final rule also prohibits the sale, by any person, of gasoline that violates, 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
inter alia,
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 a refiners' averaged compliance with the standards. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Oxygenate blenders have direct control over whether a specific fuel meets the minimum and/or maximum requirements
of the reformulated gasoline program. Blenders have no control over whether that fuel is being produced to comply
with per-gallon or averaged standards. Where gasoline is designated for oxygen compliance on a per-gallon basis,
the blender may take steps to ensure that 2.0 weight percent oxygen is added to each batch of gasoline produced. Where
gasoline is produced to averaged compliance, the blender is precluded from independent knowledge of whether the
average will be met.
