SUMMARY:
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
 On May 13, 1994 (57 FR 25004), the EPA proposed standards to regulate the emissions of volatile organic compounds VOC)
and hazardous air pollutants (HAP) from new and existing marine tank vessel loading and unloading operations which
are part of major sources under section 112 of the Clean Air Act (CAA). The initial public comment period closed on July
18, 1994. On July 15, 1994, (59 FR 36130), the EPA proposed standards to regulate the emissions of HAP from petroleum
refineries that are major sources under section 112 of the CAA. In the proposed rule for petroleum refineries, the
EPA requested comments on the concept of expanding the petroleum refinery source category to include marine vessel
loading and unloading operations subject to the requirements of section 112 of the CAA that occur at refineries. With
this notice, the EPA reopens the comment period on the marine tank vessel loading and unloading operations to request
comment on amending both the Marine Tank Vessel Loading and Unloading and Petroleum Refinery source categories to
move marine terminals collocated at refineries from the Marine Tank Vessel Loading and Unloading source category
to the Petroleum Refinery source category.

SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
 On May 13, 1994 (59 FR 25004), the EPA proposed standards to regulate the emissions of VOC and HAP from new and existing
marine tank vessel loading and unloading operations which are part of major sources under section 112 of the Clean
Air Act (CAA). The comment period on the proposed rule ended on July 18, 1994. This notice reopens the public comment
period for the proposed rule. However, only comments limited to the subject described below will be considered at
this time. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The category of major sources for marine vessel loading and unloading operations includes marine terminals which
emit chemicals listed under section 112 from the direct loading and unloading of bulk liquids from marine vessels
at marine terminals. With the exception of offshore vessel-to-vessel bulk liquid transfer operations (i.e., lightering
operations), all marine vessel terminals are included in the category of major sources for marine vessel loading
and unloading operations. Marine vessel terminals collocated at refineries are not part of the petroleum refinery
source category. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In the petroleum refinery rule, the EPA is proposing that emissions averaging be allowed for miscellaneous process
vents, storage tanks, and wastewater streams within petroleum refineries. The EPA requested comments on whether
emissions averaging should be included in the final rule, and on specific features of the proposed emissions averaging
provisions. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The petroleum refinery proposed rule addresses only the 4 emission points in refinery operations. The EPA requested
comments on the concept of expanding the petroleum refinery source category to include marine vessel loading and
unloading operations subject to the requirements of section 112 that occur at refineries. The marine vessel requirements
proposed for purposes of compliance with section 183(f), however, would remain unchanged. If the above change is
made to the petroleum refinery source category, the source category currently listed in accordance with section
112(c) as Marine Tank Vessel Loading and Unloading Operations would be split into two parts_those which are collocated
at refineries and those which are not. The ones collocated at refineries would be combined with and become part of the
refinery source category. The source category list would be amended accordingly. The purpose would be to allow emissions
averaging between the HAP emissions from marine vessel loading and unloading and the HAP emissions from the refinery
emission points identified in the petroleum refinery rule as suitable for emissions averaging. It appears that in
some cases, there may be opportunities to control some of these emission points (e.g. storage tanks) more cost-effectively
than marine vessel loading and unloading operations. In other cases, it may be more cost effective to control marine
vessel operation emissions than the refinery emission points. Integrating marine loading and unloading operations
into the refinery category and utilizing emissions averaging may provide an opportunity for more emissions reductions
at a lower cost than would occur if the categories remain separate. In addition, because of the 10 percent discount
factor, additional emissions reduction will be achieved if emissions averaging is used. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
If the suggested approach were adopted, the limitations of the proposed emissions averaging provisions included
in the petroleum refinery proposal would also apply to the loading and unloading operations. With regard to calculating
the emissions for purposes of averaging, the May 13 marine vessel operations proposal included procedures for determining
HAP emissions from marine vessel loading operations for purposes of determining applicability of the rule; the EPA
solicited comment on these procedures. These emission estimating procedures will also be considered for the purpose
of emission averaging. The promulgation date, and thus the compliance date, for the marine 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
vessel loading and unloading standard is currently expected to be 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
earlier than the petroleum refinery standard. The EPA requests 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
comments on whether and how these compliance dates should be made 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
consistent, and what legal factors should be considered.
