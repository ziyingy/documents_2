5. The provisions of the Administrative Procedure Act, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(5 U.S.C. 553), requiring notice of proposed rulemaking, the opportunity for public participation, and a delay in
effective date, are inapplicable because this regulation involves a military or foreign affairs function of the
United States. No other law requires that a notice of proposed rulemaking and an opportunity for public comment be
given for this rule. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
However, because of the importance of the issues raised by these regulations, this rule is issued in interim form and
comments will be considered in the development of final regulations. Accordingly, the Department encourages interested
persons who wish to comment to do so at the earliest possible time to permit the fullest consideration of their views.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The period for submission of comments will close April 18, 1994. The Department will consider all comments received
before the close of the comment period in developing final regulations. Comments received after the end of the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
comment period will be considered if possible, but their consideration cannot be assured. The Department will not
accept public comments accompanied by a request that a part or all of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the material be treated confidentially because of its business 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
proprietary nature or for any other reason. The Department will return such comments and materials to the person submitting
the comments and will not consider them in the development of final regulations. All public comments on these regulations
will be a matter of public record and will be available for public 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
inspection and copying. In the interest of accuracy and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
completeness, the Department requires comments in written form. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Oral comments must be followed by written memoranda, which will also be a matter of public record and will be available
for 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
public review and copying. Communications from agencies of the United States Government or foreign governments
will not be made available for public inspection.
