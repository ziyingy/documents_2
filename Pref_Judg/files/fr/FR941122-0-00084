 The experimental population rules did not utilize the best scientific and commercial data available to reach decisions,
as required by the Act.

The Service contends that this rule and the Secretary's decision to reintroduce wolves used the best scientific data
available and underwent peer review and scientific analysis. The EIS on the impacts of this rule includes several
appendices and a list of persons who contributed their expert opinions or relevant data to the decisionmaking process
(Service 1994a). Professional wildlife biologists and scientific organizations complimented the Service on the
depth and detail of its scientific investigation in regards to the reintroduction of wolves.

The reintroduction plan does not enhance the conservation and recovery of wolves, as required by the Act. Reintroduction,
particularly in central Idaho, should not be conducted or should be delayed for several years while a search for existing
wolves is conducted.

For the past 20 years and presently, the Service and others have searched for wolves in the northern Rocky Mountains.
Reviews of correspondence from the past 25 years show the longstanding and widespread view that wolves already occupied
Idaho and the discovery of their presence imminent. Very extensive monitoring within the experimental population
area has not confirmed the presence of wolves. This particular species is not habitat limited and if allowed to get
into the experimental area would reproduce and survive. The translocation of wild wolves from Canada to central Idaho
will provide the opportunity to start a wolf population. This translocation effort will greatly facilitate recovery
of the gray wolf. The 1987 Rocky Mountain wolf recovery plan recommended an additional 5 years of monitoring for natural
wolf recovery in Idaho. However, the recovery plan provided other options if two breeding pairs of wolves had not become
established in Idaho during the 5 years. Because no breeding pairs have been located, the draft and final EIS and Record
of Decision allow the simultaneous reintroduction of wolves into central Idaho and the Park in an effort to ensure
the viability and conservation of wolves in the Rocky Mountains (Service 1994a, Appendix 16).

The Service proposed a very liberal experimental rule to accommodate concerns of local residents and the affected
States. However, it did not make allowances for unforeseen circumstances that may impede or prevent wolf population
growth and recovery. Options such as increased management or greater numbers of reintroductions should be allowed
if required.

The Service believes that, as proposed, reintroduction and management techniques will result in wolf population
recovery and delisting by about 2002. Rulemaking language was added clarifying that take activities must lead to
eventual recovery of the wolf. Additionally, if there is no progress in achieving wolf population recovery (i.e.,
if wolves in a recovery area do not exhibit positive growth for 2 consecutive years), then factors impacting population
growth will be investigated. Information from the investigation will be made available to the public and appropriate
Federal, State, and tribal agencies. Within a year, the agencies may recommend and implement new management actions
or modifications to their wolf management plans to correct factors negatively impacting wolf recovery. Only as a
last resort would changes or modifications to sections of the experimental rule be made.

The proposed rules' requirements that ``only adult wolves (greater than 50 pounds) can be harassed'' and then ``only
for 15 minutes'' and ``only adult wolves that are witnessed attacking livestock on private land can be killed by private
parties'' are overly restrictive. The provision that wolves can only be killed under a special permit when (1) seen
attacking livestock for the third time on Federal lands, (2) six or more wolf packs are present in the experimental
population, and (3) all agency control efforts have failed does not address the issues in a timely or efficient manner.
The implication that land-use restrictions may be employed on private lands when five or fewer wolf packs are present
in the experimental area also needs clarification.

The Service agrees and has eliminated (1) the distinction between adult wolves and pups for both noninjurious harassment
and take and (2) the length of time wolves may be harassed (as long as physical injury is not incurred). Permittees with
grazing rights on public land can readily obtain a written take permit for wolves seen attacking livestock. However,
issuance criteria still require that prior to issuing the 45-day take permit (1) six or more wolf packs must be present
in the experimental population area, (2) authorized agencies must confirm that a wolf caused the livestock injury
or death, and (3) other agency control actions have failed to resolve the problem. The final rule also clarifies that
no land-use restrictions will be exercised by Federal agencies on private land at any time.

Certain parts of the rule need to be more specific, so that potential management situations are individually described
and addressed in the final rule. Commenters provided a variety of scenarios as examples.
