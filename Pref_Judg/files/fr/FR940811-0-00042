<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Several commentors wrote that the details of the SMMP should be known before the Final Rule is issued in order to assess
its scientific validity 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
and the feasibility of surveillance and monitoring.

In the Public Notice accompanying the Proposed Rule designating the SF&hyph;DODS, EPA discussed the broad outlines
of site surveillance and monitoring envisioned by EPA. EPA subsequently supplemented this step by making available
for public review and comment the proposed SMMP (see response above), and by incorporating many specific site management
and monitoring requirements into the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Final Rule itself as requested by several commentors. In EPA's view, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the public has had ample opportunity to comment upon the scientific 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
validity and the feasibility of EPA's proposed site surveillance and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
monitoring measures, and as a result these measures have been 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
strengthened. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In EPA's view, the surveillance and monitoring measures that EPA 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
will require for the SF&hyph;DODS are feasible and will provide the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
necessary scrutiny of site use for a full evaluation of the potential 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
for adverse environmental impacts. The monitoring and surveillance 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
measures for the SF&hyph;DODS are based upon successful measures taken at 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
other designated disposal sites in Region 9 and other parts of the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
United States, including those required by EPA to be implemented by 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the U.S. Navy on a project involving the disposal of dredged sediments 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
at a temporary dump site in the vicinity of the SF&hyph;DODS. The 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
monitoring measures for the SF&hyph;DODS were further developed with the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
benefit of conservative (environmentally protective) modeling of post-disposal dispersion of dredged sediments
at the site. This modeling, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
discussed in the Final EIS, has been demonstrated at other ocean 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
disposal sites to have a high degree of accuracy in predicting 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
dispersion of dumped sediments.

16. Management Action Trigger Levels and Significance Criteria 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Several commentors stated that the trigger levels or criteria for 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
determining when site use can be modified or terminated were 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
inappropriate or too vague in the site designation Proposed Rule, and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
appear to limit EPA's ability to take action to restrict ocean dumping 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
until significant adverse impacts have already occurred. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=81 g=1 f=1 -->
Response

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
EPA's authority to protect marine resources in the vicinity 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
of a disposal site is described in the Ocean Dumping regulations at 40 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
CFR 220.4, 228.3, 228.7, 228.8, 228.9, 228.10, and 228.11. EPA can 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
require that site use be modified or terminated based on several 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
factors, including: (1) exceedance of Federal water quality criteria 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
after disposal within the site or beyond the SF-DODS boundary; (2) 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
significant movement of disposed material toward important biological 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
resource areas or marine sanctuaries; (3) significant adverse changes 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
in the structure of the benthic community outside the disposal site 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
boundary; (4) significant adverse bioaccumulation in organisms 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
collected from the disposal site or areas adjacent to the site 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
boundary, compared to the reference site; and (5) significant adverse 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
impacts upon commercial or recreational fisheries resources near the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
site. EPA can take action based on these criteria at any time; the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
site designation Rule in no way restricts EPA's authorities in this 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
regard. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In addition to these existing authorities, the Final Rule now 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
includes additional authority for determining management actions, such 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
as site use modifications or even site use termination, as warranted 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
by site monitoring results. For example, clarifications have been 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
made to how sediment chemistry monitoring results would ``trigger'' 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
management actions. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
With respect to EPA taking actions before significant adverse 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
impacts have occurred, monitoring data will be collected periodically 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
i.e.,
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 there will be annual sampling of monitoring stations) and any 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
corrective management action taken following an annual review of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
monitoring data could therefore occur after some impacts have already 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
occurred. However, because of extensive physical, chemical, and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
biological testing of the sediments proposed for ocean disposal, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
potential adverse impacts, if any, are expected to be physical in 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
nature (
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
i.e.,
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 sediment textural changes and smothering of some 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
infauna) and confined within the boundaries of the disposal site. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Furthermore, if warranted by onboard observations (
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
i.e.,
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 direct 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
observations of significant disturbance of marine birds and mammals 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
near disposal operations) more immediate action can be taken.

17. Frequency of Monitoring 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
One commentor wrote that the proposed 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
frequency of monitoring (after a period of one year or after 6 million 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
cubic yards have been dumped), is not adequate and that monitoring 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
should be more frequent to determine seasonal differences in the plume 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
and sediment footprint. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
EPA's conservative modeling of the fate of dredged material 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
disposed at the alternative sites utilized current meter data from a 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
full year's deployment. Seasonal variability of oceanographic 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
conditions is therefore generally known, and was considered in the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
site designation Final EIS and in development of the SMMP. The 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
existing seasonal data, together with the monitoring requirements of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the Final Rule, are adequate to address seasonal variation in 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
oceanographic conditions.

18. Need for Periodic Review 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Several commentors objected to the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
designation of the site for a full 50 years without any stringent 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
requirement for periodic review. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=81 g=1 f=1 -->
Response 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The Final Rule now more clearly states that there will be 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
periodic review of monitoring data to determine if the site is 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
performing as predicted (
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
i.e.,
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 no significant adverse impacts outside 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
of the disposal site boundaries), if site modifications are necessary, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
or if site use should be terminated. Necessary changes in site 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
management can be made based on any of these reviews. Site monitoring 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
will be a strict requirement of site use. If site monitoring is not 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
implemented, disposal of dredged material will be prohibited at the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
ocean site. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

19. Baseline Data 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Several commentors wrote that the proposed SMMP, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
as summarized in the Proposed Rule, is flawed because of inadequate 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
baseline data. These commentors urged a rigorous monitoring program 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
during the first year of dumping in order to develop a more 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
scientifically sound baseline for the site. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=81 g=1 f=1 -->
Response 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Although the site designation studies were broad in 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
geographic scope, the data collected in these studies serve as an 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
appropriate baseline given the variability of biological parameters 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
which is typical of this oceanic area. The region, overall, is 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
significantly affected by many factors, including: interannual changes 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
in regional climate; climate-induced variability in abundance and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
spatial distribution of biological populations, and human-induced 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
impacts such as heavy vessel traffic and substantial commercial and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
recreational fishing. A focussed, localized one-year study of the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
site itself ignores the temporal and spatial complexity of the area, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
and would not produce a meaningful ``baseline'' for the site.
