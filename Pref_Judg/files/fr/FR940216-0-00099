EPA proposed test methods for the measurement of each of the parameters required in the creation of reformulated gasoline,
and received numerous comments regarding the proposed methods. Most of the comments were quite similar in their overall
character. However, one commenter seemed to summarize the prevailing recommendations quite well. API stated in
part: ``API recommends that EPA observe the following guiding principles regarding laboratory test methods: (1)

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Test methods must be proven
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
.&blank;.&blank;.&blank;. (2) 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Test methods must be reliable

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
.&blank;.&blank;.&blank;. (3) 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Test procedures must be suitable for refinery personnel

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
.&blank;.&blank;.&blank;. (4) 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Test methods must not be unnecessarily costly
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
.&blank;.&blank;.&blank;. (5) 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Test method reproducibility must be recognized
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
.&blank;.&blank;.&blank;. (6) 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Criteria for adoption of other methods should be developed
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
.&blank;.&blank;.&blank;.'' 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
EPA agrees with most of these criteria. It would be ideal to discover accurate test methods that have been proven reliable
in the industry, that are easy for personnel to operate and have a minimal cost. The new test method for Reid Vapor Pressure
(RVP) set forth in the volatility regulations (40 CFR part 80, appendix E, Method 3) is an example of such a method that
is accurate, easy to operate and is relatively inexpensive. These qualities in the RVP test method have enabled many
downstream parties to incorporate this method into their oversight program under the volatility rule. EPA believes
this improved oversight contributed significantly to the reduction in volatility violations during the 1993 high
ozone season. Ease of operation and cost were considered when EPA adopted this test method. However, it must be recognized
that the most important factors in the choice of the new RVP test method were its accuracy and precision. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
EPA would like to prescribe test methods that conform to API's criteria. However, EPA's leading priority must remain
precision and accuracy, even at the expense of other criteria. EPA is always willing to cooperate with industry to
investigate the possibility of easier and less expensive methods if the methods also are accurate and precise. To
do so not only aids industry, but also ultimately assists EPA's purpose of preventing violations. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
EPA must follow its policy in maintaining precision and accuracy with regard to any enforcement test tolerances as
well. EPA is determined to achieve the most accurate and precise result that is practical. EPA's purpose in testing
is to ensure relevant standards are being met, and to allow an enforcement action where EPA is able to establish a violation
with reasonable certainty. However, EPA does not have sufficient data at this time from the EPA laboratory to determine
the most precise test tolerances. Interim test tolerances have been established until that data becomes available.
Enforcement test tolerances are discussed more fully below. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Most commenters requested that EPA allow more than one test method for each parameter. The final rule provides for
one regulatory method for each parameter in order to assure accuracy and to avoid problems of bias between different
methods. Refiners and importers must use the regulatory method, or an alternative method in the case of two parameters
during a limited time period, when testing to meet the mandatory testing requirements of section 80.65(e). In addition,
independent laboratories, when conducting tests to verify the accuracy of the refiner and importer testing, must
use the regulatory method. EPA has learned from its experience with other motor vehicle fuel regulatory programs,
notably volatility, that it is preferable to have one regulatory testing method as opposed to multiple regulatory
test methods for each parameter because of the potential for conflicting results among methods due to bias. However,
in two cases, oxygen and aromatics, where the test methods are relatively new, the regulation provides for optional
alternative methods for refiners and importers to use to meet the testing requirements of section 80.65(e) until
January 1, 1997, providing lead-time for industry to acquire equipment and to become familiar with use of the regulatory
methods. Of course, these alternative methods can likewise be used at any time for defense purposes as long as there
is correlation with the regulatory methods.

Reid vapor pressure (RVP). 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
EPA proposed to use the ASTM method ES&hyph;15 or the procedure described in 40 CFR part 80, appendices D and E. Comments
favored the use of ASTM ES&hyph;15. However, it was noted that ES&hyph;15 is a temporary emergency ASTM standard and
will expire shortly. ASTM D&hyph;5191 is the permanent standard. It was also noted that this method is suitable for
oxygenated blends. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Commenters requested that EPA also allow the two dry methods set forth in appendices D and E in 40 CFR part 80. These methods
are the manual tank and gauge method, the Herzog analog method, and the Herzog digital method. In addition, a request
was made to include the ASTM D&hyph;5190 method, an alternative mini method. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
EPA has decided that RVP must be determined in accordance with the method in 40 CFR part 80, appendix E, Method 3. This
method, very similar to ASTM D&hyph;5191, clearly complies with many of the criteria espoused by API. The method is
simple and inexpensive. Industry has already begun to gear up for this method because of its use in the Phase II Volatility
regulations. It is appropriate to use the same RVP test method for the volatility and reformulated gasoline programs
to prevent confusion and inconsistencies. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
EPA has decided that the method in 40 CFR part 80, appendix E, Method 3 will be the only regulatory volatility test method.
As with the volatility rule, other methods may be used for defense purposes as long as the method used is properly correlated
with the regulatory method. (40 CFR part 80, appendix E, Method 3, Paragraph 9.4). See, 58 FR 14476 (March 17, 1993)
for a more thorough discussion regarding the choice of a single volatility test method.

Distillations.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
EPA proposed to use the ASTM method D&hyph;86&hyph;82 as the regulatory test method, and comments were favorable
with regard to this method. It was noted, however, that the method was updated in November 1990. This most recent revision
of this method is ASTM D&hyph;86&hyph;90. One commenter requested that the language be more specific. Another commenter
suggested that a newer method, D&hyph;3710, which is a gas chromatography method, be used. A notation was also made
that the repeatability and reproducibility figures in degrees Fahrenheit in the ASTM method D&hyph;86&hyph;90
were incorrect. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
EPA has decided that the distillation parameters must be determined in accordance with the ASTM method D&hyph;86&hyph;90.
The regulatory language has been amended to state that the figures for repeatability and reproducibility given in
degrees Fahrenheit in Table 9 in the ASTM method are incorrect, and may not be used. As with all the parameters, there
will be only one regulatory distillation test method. However, other suitable methods may be used for defense purposes
(but not to meet mandatory testing requirements) as long as they are properly correlated with the regulatory test
method. EPA is always interested in the development of alternative methods if they are as accurate and precise as the
regulatory test method. Many of the parameters in reformulated gasoline can be measured by a gas chromatograph with
an appropriate detector. For this reason, it might be appropriate to explore the development of the D&hyph;3710 method
or some alternative gas chromatographic method with an appropriate detector for future use as the distillation test
method.
