Since no substantive examination would be given to any provisional application, the filing of an information disclosure
statement in a provisional application is unnecessary and will not be permitted. Therefore, paragraph (b) of &sect;1.51
would make it clear that the Office will not accept an information disclosure statement in a provisional application.
Any information disclosure statements filed in a provisional application would either be returned or disposed of
at the convenience of the Office.

Section 1.53 would have the title and paragraph (a) revised to refer to application number, rather than application
serial number. The term ``application number'' is found in current &sect;1.5(a).
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
A new paragraph (b)(2) would be added to &sect;1.53 setting forth the requirements for obtaining a filing date for
a provisional application. Existing paragraph (b) would be redesignated as paragraph (b)(1) and would be amended
to: (1) Refer to &sect;1.17(i) rather than 1.17(i)(1) to conform to the proposed change therein; (2) delete the reference
to &sect;1.60 which is proposed to be removed; and (3) clarify that continuations, divisions and continuations-in-part
may be filed under either &sect;1.53 or &sect;1.62. Paragraph (b)(2) would state that a filing date would be accorded
to a provisional application as of the date the written description, any necessary drawings and the names of all inventors
are filed in the Office. The filing date requirements for a provisional application set forth in new paragraph (b)(2)
parallel the existing requirements set forth in current paragraph (b), except that no claim would be required. In
order to keep the cost of processing provisional applications down and to reduce the handling of the provisional applications,
amendments, other than those required to make the provisional application comply with applicable regulations,
would not be permitted after the filing date of the provisional application.

New &sect;1.53(b)(2)(i) would require all provisional applications to be filed with a cover sheet identifying the
application as a provisional application. The paragraph would also indicate that the Office will treat an application
as having been filed under paragraph (b)(1), unless the application is identified as a provisional application.
This proposal is similar to the current requirement in &sect;1.62 that the application include a specific request
for an application under &sect;1.62. The cover sheet with identification that a provisional application is intended
should greatly assist the Correspondence and Mail Division in distinguishing provisional applications from other
types of applications. A provisional application, which is identified as such, but which does not have a complete
cover sheet as required by &sect;1.51(a)(2)(i) would be treated as a provisional application. The complete cover
sheet and a surcharge would be required to be submitted at a later date.

Section 1.53(b)(2)(ii) would establish a procedure for converting an application filed under &sect;1.53(b)(1)
to a provisional application. The procedure would require the filing of a petition requesting the conversion and
the $50.00/$25.00 petition fee set forth in &sect;1.17(q). Filing of the petition in the application would be required
prior to the payment of the issue fee or prior to 12 months after its filing date, whichever event is earlier. The grant
of any such petition would not entitle applicant to a refund of the fees properly paid in the application filed under
&sect;1.53(b)(1).
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Section 1.53(b)(2)(iii) is intended to call attention to the provisions of S. 2467 and H.R. 5110 which prohibit any
provisional application from claiming a right of priority under 35 U.S.C. 119 or 365(a) or the benefit of an earlier
filing date under 35 U.S.C. 120, 121 or 365(c) of any other application. Attention would be called to the provisions
of the legislation which provide that no claim for benefit of an earlier filing date may be made in a design application
based on a provisional application and that no request for a statutory invention registration may be filed in a provisional
application. Section 1.53(b)(2)(iii) would specify that the requirements of &sect;1.821(e), relating to the filing
of a copy of the ``Sequence Listing'' in computer readable form, are not applicable to a provisional application.
It is noted that all other sequence requirements as set forth in &sect;1.821 through 1.823 and 1.825 are applicable
to a provisional application.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Section 1.53(c) would require that any request for review of a refusal to accord an application a filing date be made
by way of a petition accompanied by the fee set forth in &sect;1.17(i), i.e., $130.00, if the application was filed
under &sect;1.53(b)(1), or by the fee set forth in &sect;1.17(q), i.e., $50.00/$25.00, if the application was filed
under &sect;1.53(b)(2). This reflects the current practice set forth in section 506.02 of the Manual of Patent Examining
Procedure (MPEP) with regard to any request for review of a refusal to accord a filing date for an application. The Office
would continue its current practice of refunding the petition fee, if the refusal to accord the requested filing date
is found to have been an Office error.
