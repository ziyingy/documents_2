A. Air Impacts 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The air emission reductions discussed below, as well as all other impacts discussed in today's proposal, are nationwide
impacts that would result from full implementation of the guidelines and are relative to the current baseline MWC
population, considering in-place air pollution control devices. These are not incremental impacts relative to
the February 11, 1991 emission guidelines. The total impacts are presented because the February 11, 1991 guidelines
have not been implemented and are being significantly altered by today's proposal. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Under today's proposed emission guidelines, nationwide emissions of total dioxins/furans would be reduced by about
157 kilograms per year (kg/yr) compared with emissions in the absence of nationwide guidelines. Emissions of dioxins/furans
on a TEQ basis would be reduced by about 2,620 grams per year (g/yr). This represents a nationwide reduction of about
99 percent compared to baseline levels in the absence of the guidelines. Remaining nationwide dioxin/furan emissions
would be about 42 g/yr TEQ. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Nationwide emissions of PM would be decreased by about 3,100 megagrams per year (Mg/yr) compared with levels in the
absence of emission guidelines. This represents a reduction of just under 50 percent compared to baseline levels
in the absence of nationwide guidelines. In combination with baseline control, this would represent greater than
99-percent PM control. Emissions of Cd would be reduced by about 6 Mg/yr, Pb would be reduced by about 91 Mg/yr, and Hg
would be reduced by about 48 Mg/yr. These emission reductions represent decreases of about 70 to 80 percent for each
of these three metals. In combination with baseline control, this would represent greater than 99-percent control
for Cd and Pb and greater than 80-percent control for Hg.

 and HCl would be decreased by 43,000 Mg/yr and 56,000 Mg/yr, respectively, relative to current baseline levels. This
represents about 87-percent control of acid gases compared to baseline levels in the absence of emission guidelines.
In combination with baseline control, this would represent about 95-percent control of these acid gases.

 by 19,000 Mg/yr, representing an overall nationwide emission reduction of over 30 percent compared to baseline levels
that would be emitted without the proposed guidelines.

B. Water and Solid Waste Impacts 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Water and solid waste impacts that would result from today's proposal were determined not to be significant. No water
pollution impacts are projected because the control technologies considered would not produce a wastewater stream.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The EPA believes that MWC ash disposal is adequately addressed by current waste management standards, so that considerations
of ash quality need not play a role in this rulemaking.

C. Energy Impacts 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The energy impacts of applying add-on pollutant emission controls required as part of today's proposal would not
result in significant energy impacts. Today's proposal for MWC acid gases, MWC organics, MWC metals, and NO
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 would affect an estimated 179 MWC plants and would result in energy requirements of 400 to 500 gigawatt-hours per year
(GW-hr/yr) of electricity to operate the air pollution control devices, and about 780 terajoules per year (TJ/yr)
of natural gas to maintain combustor operating conditions that reflect GCP. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Most of the MWC's that would be affected by the proposed guidelines generate electricity for sale. For example, a large
mass burn/waterwall MWC plant would generate about 500 GW-hr/yr of electricity. The energy to operate its air pollution
control equipment would represent only about 4 percent of generation. Additionally, natural gas that is fired for
GCP requirements represents less than 0.2 percent of the annual heat input to MWC's. Considering that a large percentage
of new power plant capacity to be constructed in the next 10 years will fire natural gas, the firing of small amounts
of natural gas for GCP (while generating electricity) actually reallocates natural gas use rather than just increasing
consumption.

1. National Overview 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The EPA projects that about 33 million Mg of MSW will be combusted in the year 2000 in existing MWC plants subject to the
guidelines being proposed today. The EPA estimates that there would be 179 existing MWC plants in operation that would
be subject to the subpart Cb guidelines: 60 in the 35- to 225-Mg/day capacity range and 119 in the larger than 225-Mg/day
capacity range. The typical plant has two or three MWC units. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The cost estimates given below are in 1990 dollars and are for emission control and compliance testing. The estimates
do not include costs for such things as permitting and enforcement. To estimate the costs of the guidelines being proposed
today, the EPA has taken into account all existing control equipment. Cost estimates are incremental over costs associated
with the control equipment in current use and include retrofit premiums. Cost estimates are total costs for the revised
MWC guidelines and are not incremental to the February 11, 1991 guidelines. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The nationwide annual cost of the guidelines including testing, reporting, and recordkeeping for acid gas, PM, Hg,
and NO

 control would be about $445 million. The national average annual cost of the guidelines per unit of MSW combusted would
be about $14/Mg.
