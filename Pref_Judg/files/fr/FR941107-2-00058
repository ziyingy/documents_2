Purpose
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
If an unsafe product is found with no identifying information on it, the Commission may be unable to determine its manufacturer,
private labeler or importer. Corrective action may therefore not occur, and consumers will remain at risk. One purpose
of this proposal is to assure that the Commission will be able to identify the firms responsible for all unsafe products,
and be able to pursue corrective actions.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
When firms do take corrective actions, such as warning the public and recalling unsafe products, the lack of inadequacy
of identifying information may prevent consumers from knowing whether they have the product in question. Many products
look the same or similar, and their markings may be the only practicable way to identify them. A second purpose of this
proposal is to assure that consumers will be able to identify products that are the subject of warnings and recalls.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
If a product has been coded by date and/or production run, the scope of any recall of that product can be limited and its
cost reduced. A third purpose of this proposal is to achieve this result.

Marking Provisions
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Every children's product and fireworks product shall be permanently marked to indicate: the name of the U.S. firm
that is the manufacturer or private labeler of the product; the location or business address in the United States,
including the city, state and zip code, of the U.S. firm; a number (such as a model number or stock number) or symbol that
identifies the product and distinguishes it from all other products which are not of identical construction, composition
and dimensions; and a date or number or symbol that identifies the production run or date of manufacture of the product.
The packaging of every product shall also be marked or printed with the same information. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The information described above must be in letters and numbers that are at least one-sixteenth inch high and must be
able to be read without any disassembly of the product.

Exceptions
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
A U.S. firm that would be identified on a product may notify the Commission's Office of the Secretary that it intends
to use a registered trademark, a corporate symbol or some other unique code instead of the firm's name and address.
If the Commission does not object within ten working days after receiving such notification on grounds that the chosen
code would not adequately distinguished the firm from another company, the firm nay use that code.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The model and production run information may also be coded if the code and/or the uncoded information is available
to any Consumer Product Safety Commission representative immediately upon request at the specified address.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
If it is physically or technologically impracticable to permanently mark a children's product or fireworks product,
the required information shall be permanently marked or printed on (1) the immediate container of the product, (2)
any container sold with and intended to be used with the product, and (3) any container sold with and intended to be used
for storage of the product after purchase.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
If a children's product or fireworks product is as set or collection, only the largest component must be permanently
marked. If all of the components are the same size, or if multiple components are ``the largest,'' all such components
must be marked. Unless every component of a set or collection is marked, the containers of the product must also be marked.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
