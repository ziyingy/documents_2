I. Background
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Pursuant to Public Law 97-415, the U.S. Nuclear Regulatory Commission (the Commission or NRC staff) is publishing
this regular biweekly notice. Public Law 97-415 revised section 189 of the Atomic Energy Act of 1954, as amended (the
Act), to require the Commission to publish notice of any amendments issued, or proposed to be issued, under a new provision
of section 189 of the Act. This provision grants the Commission the authority to issue and make immediately effective
any amendment to an operating license upon a determination by the Commission that such amendment involves no significant
hazards consideration, notwithstanding the pendency before the Commission of a request for a hearing from any person.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
This biweekly notice includes all notices of amendments issued, or proposed to be issued from July 11, 1994, through
July 22, 1994. The last biweekly notice was published on July 20, 1994 (59 FR 37060).

Notice Of Consideration Of Issuance Of Amendments To Facility Operating Licenses, Proposed No Significant Hazards
Consideration Determination, Opportunity For A Hearing
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The Commission has made a proposed determination that the following amendment requests involve no significant hazards
consideration. Under the Commission's regulations in 10 CFR 50.92, this means that operation of the facility in accordance
with the proposed amendment would not (1) involve a significant increase in the probability or consequences of an
accident previously evaluated; or (2) create the possibility of a new or different kind of accident from any accident
previously evaluated; or (3) involve a significant reduction in a margin of safety. The basis for this proposed determination
for each amendment request is shown below. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Commission is seeking public comments on this proposed determination. Any comments received within 30 days after
the date of publication of this notice will be considered in making any final determination. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Normally, the Commission will not issue the amendment until the expiration of the 30-day notice period. However,
should circumstances change during the notice period such that failure to act in a timely way would result, for example,
in derating or shutdown of the facility, the Commission may issue the license amendment before the expiration of the
30-day notice period, provided that its final determination is that the amendment involves no significant hazards
consideration. The final determination will consider all public and State comments received before action is taken.
Should the Commission take this action, it will publish in the 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 -->
Federal Register 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
a notice of issuance and provide for opportunity for a hearing after issuance. The Commission expects that the need
to take this action will occur very infrequently. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Written comments may be submitted by mail to the Rules Review and Directives Branch, Division of Freedom of Information
and Publications Services, Office of Administration, U.S. Nuclear Regulatory Commission, Washington, DC 20555,
and should cite the publication date and page number of this 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 -->
Federal Register 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
notice. Written comments may also be delivered to Room 6D22, Two White Flint North, 11545 Rockville Pike, Rockville,
Maryland from 7:30 a.m. to 4:15 p.m. Federal workdays. Copies of written comments received may be examined at the NRC
Public Document Room, the Gelman Building, 2120 L Street, NW., Washington, DC 20555. The filing of requests for a hearing
and petitions for leave to intervene is discussed below.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
By September 2, 1994, the licensee may file a request for a hearing with respect to issuance of the amendment to the subject
facility operating license and any person whose interest may be affected by this proceeding and who wishes to participate
as a party in the proceeding must file a written request for a hearing and a petition for leave to intervene. Requests
for a hearing and a petition for leave to intervene shall be filed in accordance with the Commission's ``Rules of Practice
for Domestic Licensing Proceedings'' in 10 CFR Part 2. Interested persons should consult a current copy of 10 CFR 2.714
which is available at the Commission's Public Document Room, the Gelman Building, 2120 L Street, NW., Washington,
DC 20555 and at the local public document room for the particular facility involved. If a request for a hearing or petition
for leave to intervene is filed by the above date, the Commission or an Atomic Safety and Licensing Board, designated
by the Commission or by the Chairman of the Atomic Safety and Licensing Board Panel, will rule on the request and/or
petition; and the Secretary or the designated Atomic Safety and Licensing Board will issue a notice of a hearing or
an appropriate order. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
As required by 10 CFR 2.714, a petition for leave to intervene shall set forth with particularity the interest of the
petitioner in the proceeding, and how that interest may be affected by the results of the proceeding. The petition
should specifically explain the reasons why intervention should be permitted with particular reference to the following
factors: (1) the nature of the petitioner's right under the Act to be made a party to the proceeding; (2) the nature and
extent of the petitioner's property, financial, or other interest in the proceeding; and (3) the possible effect
of any order which may be entered in the proceeding on the petitioner's interest. The petition should also identify
the specific aspect(s) of the subject matter of the proceeding as to which petitioner wishes to intervene. Any person
who has filed a petition for leave to intervene or who has been admitted as a party may amend the petition without requesting
leave of the Board up to 15 days prior to the first prehearing conference scheduled in the proceeding, but such an amended
petition must satisfy the specificity requirements described above.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Not later than 15 days prior to the first prehearing conference scheduled in the proceeding, a petitioner shall file
a supplement to the petition to intervene which must include a list of the contentions which are sought to be litigated
in the matter. Each contention must consist of a specific statement of the issue of law or fact to be raised or controverted.
In addition, the petitioner shall provide a brief explanation of the bases of the contention and a concise statement
of the alleged facts or expert opinion which support the contention and on which the petitioner intends to rely in proving
the contention at the hearing. The petitioner must also provide references to those specific sources and documents
of which the petitioner is aware and on which the petitioner intends to rely to establish those facts or expert opinion.
Petitioner must provide sufficient information to show that a genuine dispute exists with the applicant on a material
issue of law or fact. Contentions shall be limited to matters within the scope of the amendment under consideration.
The contention must be one which, if proven, would entitle the petitioner to relief. A petitioner who fails to file
such a supplement which satisfies these requirements with respect to at least one contention will not be permitted
to participate as a party. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Those permitted to intervene become parties to the proceeding, subject to any limitations in the order granting leave
to intervene, and have the opportunity to participate fully in the conduct of the hearing, including the opportunity
to present evidence and cross-examine witnesses. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
If a hearing is requested, the Commission will make a final determination on the issue of no significant hazards consideration.
The final determination will serve to decide when the hearing is held. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
If the final determination is that the amendment request involves no significant hazards consideration, the Commission
may issue the amendment and make it immediately effective, notwithstanding the request for a hearing. Any hearing
held would take place after issuance of the amendment. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
If the final determination is that the amendment request involves a significant hazards consideration, any hearing
held would take place before the issuance of any amendment. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
A request for a hearing or a petition for leave to intervene must be filed with the Secretary of the Commission, U.S.
Nuclear Regulatory Commission, Washington, DC 20555, Attention: Docketing and Services Branch, or may be delivered
to the Commission's Public Document Room, the Gelman Building, 2120 L Street, NW., Washington DC 20555, by the above
date. Where petitions are filed during the last 10 days of the notice period, it is requested that the petitioner promptly
so inform the Commission by a toll-free telephone call to Western Union at 1-(800) 248-5100 (in Missouri 1-(800) 342-6700).
The Western Union operator should be given Datagram Identification Number N1023 and the following message addressed
to

notice. A copy of the petition should also be sent to the Office of the General Counsel, U.S. Nuclear Regulatory Commission,
Washington, DC 20555, and to the attorney for the licensee. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Nontimely filings of petitions for leave to intervene, amended petitions, supplemental petitions and/or requests
for a hearing will not be entertained absent a determination by the Commission, the presiding officer or the Atomic
Safety and Licensing Board that the petition and/or request should be granted based upon a balancing of factors specified
in 10 CFR 2.714(a)(1)(i)-(v) and 2.714(d). 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

The proposed amendment will delete the requirement to perform alternate train testing to demonstrate that other,
similar, safety-related components are operable when components are found, or made, inoperable in the safety injection,
residual heat removal, and containment spray systems. The surveillance requirements, which the licensee refers
to as accelerated testing requirements, affect the following components:

Basis for proposed no significant hazards consideration determination: 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
As required by 10 CFR 50.91(a), the licensee has provided its analysis of the issue of no significant hazards consideration,
which is presented below:
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->
1. The proposed amendment does not involve a significant increase in the probability or consequences of an accident
previously evaluated.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The proposed amendment does not involve a significant increase in the probability of an accident previously evaluated
because the availability of the subject components will not be reduced and the design and performance of the components
are not being changed. The subject components are provided to mitigate the consequences of analyzed accidents; therefore
their availability has no bearing on the probability of occurrence of these accidents.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The proposed amendment does not involve a significant increase in the consequences of an accident previously evaluated.
This change deletes alternate train testing requirements which, if maintained, could result in loss of the safety
function. Elimination of the requirements will serve to ensure that one train of safety equipment is always available
to mitigate the consequences of an analyzed accident. The remaining surveillance requirements provide adequate
assurance that the components will be operable when required. Therefore the consequences of previously evaluated
accidents will not be increase.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
2. The proposed amendment does not create the possibility of a new or different kind of accident from any previously
evaluated because these proposed changes do not introduce any new modes of operation or testing, and no physical changes
are being made to the plant. Therefore no new or different kind of accident could be initiated by this amendment.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
3. The proposed revisions do not involve a significant reduction in the margin of safety since the routine testing
requirements that remain in the Technical Specifications provide adequate assurance that the components will be
operable when needed. Since the elimination of this accelerated testing will decrease component wear and improve
availability, the margin of safety should be increased. Since accelerated testing may still occur when component
problems involve a potential common mode failure, margins of safety associated with the components' abilities to
perform their design functions will not be affected. Therefore, the proposed changes do not involve a significant
reduction in a margin of safety.

The NRC staff has reviewed the licensee's analysis and, based on this review, it appears that the three standards of
10 CFR 50.92(c) are satisfied. Therefore, the NRC staff proposes to determine that the amendment request involves
no significant hazards consideration.

The proposed amendment would make several changes to the Administrative Controls in Section 6 of Technical Specifications
(TS) for Byron and Braidwood stations. The proposed changes include: (1) a change to the submittal frequency of the
Radiological Effluent Release Report, (2) a revision to the Shift Technical Advisor description, (3) clarification
of the Shift Engineer's responsibilities, and (4) editorial changes. The references to the Semiannual Radiological
Effluent Release Report are also revised in other sections of the TS.

As required by 10 CFR 50.91(a), the licensee has provided its analysis of the issue of no significant hazards consideration,
which is presented below:
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->
A. The proposed changes do not involve a significant increase in the probability or consequences of an accident previously
evaluated. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The proposed changes to Section 6 of Technical Specifications do not affect any accident initiators or precursors
and do not change or alter the design assumptions for the systems or components used to mitigate the consequences of
an accident. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The proposed changes are administrative in nature and provide clarification. These changes provide consistency
with station procedures, programs, the Code of Federal Regulations, other Technical Specifications, and Standard
Technical Specifications. These changes do not impact any accident previously evaluated in the UFSAR. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
B. The proposed changes do not create the possibility of a new or different kind of accident from any accident previously
evaluated. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The proposed changes do not affect the design or operation of any system, structure, or component in the plant. There
are no changes to parameters governing plant operation; no new or different type of equipment will be installed. The
proposed changes are considered to be administrative changes. All responsibilities described in Technical Specifications
for management activities will continue to be performed by qualified individuals. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
C. The proposed changes do not involve a significant reduction in a margin of safety. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The proposed changes do not affect the margin of safety for any Technical Specification. The initial conditions and
methodologies used in the accident analyses remain unchanged, therefore, accident analysis results are not impacted.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The proposed changes are administrative in nature and have no impact on the margin of safety of any Technical Specification.
They do not affect any plant safety parameters or setpoints. The descriptions for the Shift Technical Advisor and
Shift Engineer are clarified, however, include no reduction to their responsibilities.

Description of amendment request: 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The proposed amendments would revise Technical Specification (TS) 3/4.4.5, ``Steam Generators,'' and the associated
bases. Previously the NRC granted amendments to the TSs which authorized the use of selected steam generator sleeving
processes. In authorizing use of the processes, the amendments cited references to specific NRC approved vendor
technical reports, including revision number. The proposed changes reference the reports in generic terms as those
that have been approved by the NRC, subject to limitations and restrictions as noted by the NRC staff. While the licensee
will still have to request NRC approval for application of the technologies as referenced in vendor reports, the licenses
will not have to be amended each time.

Basis for proposed no significant hazards consideration determination: 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
As required by 10 CFR 50.91(a), the licensee has provided its analysis of the issue of no significant hazards consideration,
which is presented below:
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->
1. The proposed change does not involve a significant increase in the probability or consequences of an accident previously
evaluated.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The proposed changes to the Steam Generator section of Technical Specifications do not affect any accident initiators
or precursors and do not alter the design assumptions for the systems or components used to mitigate the consequences
of an accident. These changes are editorial changes to the requirements currently identified in the Technical Specifications.
The requirements approved by the NRC will not be reduced by this request. The proposed change maintains the administrative
controls necessary to ensure safe plant operation.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The original amendment requested tubesheet sleeves and tube support plate sleeves as an alternate tube repair method
for Bryon and Braidwood Units 1 and 2. The steam generator sleeves approved for installation use the Westinghouse
process (laser welded joints) or the Babcock &amp; Wilcox Nuclear Technologies (BWNT) process of kinetically welded
joints. The sleeve configuration was designed and analyzed in accordance with the criteria of Regulatory Guide (RG)
1.121 and the design requirements of Section III of the American Society of Mechanical Engineers (ASME) Code. Fatigue
and stress analyses of the sleeved tube assemblies for both processes produced acceptable results documented in
the current Westinghouse and BWNT Technical Reports. The proposed Technical Specifications change to allow the
use of the current NRC approved laser welded or kinetically welded sleeving process does not adversely impact any
other previously evaluated design basis accident or the results of these analyses. Therefore, the editorial changes
to the referenced sleeving Technical Reports will not increase the probability of occurrence of an accident previously
evaluated.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
2. The proposed change does not create the possibility of a new or different kind of accident from any accident previously
evaluated.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The proposed changes are considered to be administrative changes. All the requirements described in Technical Specifications
``Acceptance Criteria'' for the Steam Generators will continue to be implemented as described in the current Technical
Reports.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Referencing the current Westinghouse or BWNT Sleeving Technical Reports currently approved by the NRC and subject
to the limitations and restrictions as noted by the NRC, has no effect upon any design transient or accident analyses.
The proposed changes do not affect the design or operation of any system, structure, or component in the plant. There
are no changes to parameters governing plant operation and no new or different type of equipment will be installed.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The use of the proposed sleeving processes will not introduce significant or adverse changes to the plant design basis.
Stress and fatigue analyses of the repair have shown the ASME Code and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
RG 1.121 allowable values are met. Implementation of the currently approved laser welded or kinetically welded sleeving
will continue to maintain the overall tube bundle structural integrity at a level consistent with that of the originally
supplied tubing. Repair of a tube with a sleeve does not provide a mechanism which would result in an accident outside
of the area affected by the sleeve. Any hypothetical accident as a result of potential tube or sleeve degradation in
the repaired portion of the tube is bounded by the existing steam generator tube rupture accident analysis. The tube
rupture accident analysis accounts for the installation of sleeves and the impact on current plugging level analyses.
The sleeve design does not affect any other component or location on the tube outside of the immediate area repaired.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Thus, the possibility of a new or different type of accident from any accident previously evaluated is not created.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
3. The proposed change does not involve a significant reduction in a margin of safety.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The proposed change is administrative in nature and has no impact on the margin of safety of any Technical Specification.
Specific technical reports are no longer referenced in Technical Specifications. An editorial change is made to
TS referencing the current NRC approved vendor Technical Report, subject to the limitations and restrictions noted
by the NRC. The initial conditions and methodologies used in the accident analyses remain unchanged.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The laser welded and kinetically welded sleeving repair of degraded steam generator tubes has been shown by analysis
to restore the integrity of the tube bundle to its original design basis condition. The safety factors used in the design
of sleeves for the repair of degraded tubes are consistent with the safety factors in the ASME Boiler and Pressure Vessel
Code used in steam generator design. The design of the tube sleeves has been verified by testing to preclude leakage
during normal and postulated accident conditions. Installation of either type of vendor sleeve using the current
approved process will continue to maintain the structural integrity of the steam generator tubes.

Description of amendment request: 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The proposed amendments would revise the LaSalle County Station, Units 1 and 2, Technical Specifications (TS), Appendix
A, in order to facilitate implementation of the Thermal Limits portion of the General Electric Average Power Range
Monitor (APRM)/Rod Block Monitor (RBM)/TS Improvement Program (ARTS).
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

As required by 10 CFR 50.91(a), the licensee has provided its analysis of the issue of no significant hazards consideration,
which is presented below:

The proposed changes do not involve a significant increase in the probability or consequences of an accident previously
evaluated because:
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The probability of an accident previously evaluated will not increase as a result of this change, because no changes
to plant systems will occur. All changes are related to core monitoring software, and there will be no physical changes
to equipment.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The consequences of an accident previously evaluated will not increase as a result of the proposed changes. The power-
and flow-dependent MCPR and MAPLHGR limits incorporate sufficient conservatism so the safety limit MCPR [SLMCPR]
(operating limit MCPR [OLMCPR] for automatic flow control) and the fuel thermal-mechanical limits will not be violated
for any power and flow condition. Because these limits are protected during normal operation, the consequences of
any transient will not increase with this change in limit definition. General Electric has verified in Attachment
E that the introduction of Arts will not cause any change in the Licensing Basis PCT [Peak Centerline Temperature]
resulting from a Loss-Of-Coolant Accident [LOCA], nor any change in the results satisfying the other LOCA acceptance
criteria of 10 CFR 50.46 and Section 15.6.5 of NUREG-0800 (Standard Review Plan), which are: cladding oxidation,
metal-water reaction (hydrogen generation), coolable geometry and long-term cooling.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The proposed changes do not create the possibility of a new or different kind of accident from any accident previously
evaluated because:
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Since no physical changes to any plant system are occurring, there will be no new or different types of accidents created
by this change. No interactions between equipment systems will be changed in any manner. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The proposed changes do not involve a significant reduction in a margin of safety because:
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The power- and flow-dependent MCPR and MAPLHGR limits will sufficiently protect the SLMCPR (OLMCPR for automatic
flow control) and the fuel thermal-mechanical limits at all power and flow conditions. The ARTS limits conservatively
assure that all licensing criteria are satisfied without setdown of the flow referenced APRM scram and rod block trips.
The limits were developed using NRC approved methods, and satisfy the same NRC approved criteria that the APRM setdown
requirement does.

Criterion 1
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The requested amendments will not involve a significant increase in the probability or consequences of an accident
previously evaluated. Increasing the surveillance interval of TS [Technical Specification] 4.6.2d from five to
ten years will have no impact upon the probability of any accident, since the NS [containment spray] system is not accident
initiating equipment. Also, since Catawba's... flow test histor[y] support[s] making the proposed change, system
response following an accident will not be adversely affected. Therefore, the requested amendments will not result
in increased accident consequences. Deletion of the obsolete footnote as indicated in the Catawba TS markup is purely
an administrative change, and therefore will have no impact upon either the probability or consequences of any accident.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Criterion 2
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The requested amendments will not create the possibility of a new or different kind of accident from any accident previously
evaluated. As stated above, the NS system is not accident initiating equipment. No new failure modes can be created
from an accident standpoint. The plant will not be operated in a different manner. Deletion of the Catawba obsolete
footnote has no bearing on any accident initiating mechanisms.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Criterion 3
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The requested amendments will not involve a significant reduction in a margin of safety. Plant safety margins will
be unaffected by the proposed changes. The NS system will still be capable of fulfilling its required safety function,
since plant operating experience supports the proposed change. Finally, the proposed amendments are consistent
with the NRC position and guidance set forth in NUREG-1366 and Generic Letter 93-05. Deletion of the Catawba obsolete
footnote will not result in any impact to plant safety margins.

The amendments would revise Technical Specification (TS) 3.4 to address the need to bypass automatic initiation
of the Emergency Feedwater (EFW) system when the main feedwater pump discharge pressure is below actuation setpoint
during startup and shutdown in order to prevent inadvertent actuation. The proposed amendment is in response to NRC
Inspection Report 50-269, 50-270, 50-287/90-30 (Inspector Followup Item 90-30-02), which determined that the
existing TSs regarding initiation circuitry for the EFW system were inadequate. The amendments would also delete
operability requirements for the Emergency Condenser Cooling Water (ECCW) system. The licensee determined that
the ECCW system is not required to remove decay heat following any design basis event.

(1) [The amendment request would not] involve a significant increase in the probability or consequences of an accident
previously evaluated.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Each accident analysis addressed within the Oconee FSAR [Final Safety Analysis Report] has been examined with respect
to changes proposed within this amendment request. The design basis of the Emergency Feedwater (EFW) System is to
supply feedwater to the steam generators in the event Main Feedwater is lost. The EFW system provides the required
flow rate to cool the RCS [reactor coolant system] down to the point at which the Decay Heat Removal System is designed
to operate. The EFW system is also designed to cool the RCS following a small break LOCA [loss of coolant accident].
Changes included within this amendment request are provided to clarify requirements for the operability of EFW.
Specifically, theses changes clarify that automatic initiation circuitry due to low main feedwater pump discharge
pressure or low hydraulic oil pressure may be bypassed when the reactor is shutdown to prevent inadvertent actuation.
In addition, these changes provide that if an EFW pump is inoperable due only to the inoperability of automatic initiation,
cooldown to below 250
<!-- PJG 0017 degreeslatlong -->
&cir;F is not necessary after the reactor is shutdown. Accident analysis for the loss of main feedwater, and subsequent
initiation of EFW, assumes initial conditions of the reactor at full power operation. The utilization of criticality
for this specific automatic initiation circuitry to be operable ensures the EFW system is operated within the boundaries
of design basis for Oconee while also providing a reasonable margin to prevent inadvertent actuation. It is not possible
to place this automatic initiation circuitry in service prior to exceeding 250
<!-- PJG 0017 degreeslatlong -->
&cir;F because the main feedwater pump discharge pressure is well below the initiation setpoint at this value. Manual
initiation circuitry operability is required prior to exceeding an RCS temperature of 250
<!-- PJG 0017 degreeslatlong -->
&cir;F. This change only clarifies existing configuration and control for the Oconee units and does not increase
the probability or consequences of any accident previously evaluated.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
This change also removes the requirement for Emergency Condenser Cooling Water (ECCW) System operability for the
removal of decay heat using the secondary systems. The ability to provide flow through the condenser from the ECCW
system is a preferred method for decay heat removal. However, this mode of operation is not necessary to prevent or
mitigate any accident previously evaluated. The primary success path for decay heat removal following loss of station
power events, and thus loss of normal CCW flow, is the use of the turbine driven EFW pump providing flow to the steam generators
and heat removal via the main steam safety relief valves to the atmosphere. Analysis has shown that sufficient inventory
exists in secondary systems, as limited by Technical Specification 3.4.4, to provide for decay heat removal.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Therefore, this proposed change deletes the requirement for ECCW for secondary systems decay heat removal. The probability
or consequences of any design basis accident are not increased by this change. As such, this change will not involve
a significant increase in the probability or consequences of an accident previously evaluated.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(2) [The amendment request would not] create the possibility of a new or different kind of accident from any kind of
accident previously evaluated.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Changes included within this amendment request are provided to clarify existing requirements for operability of
the EFW System and remove the requirement for ECCW flow through the condenser for decay heat removal. Operation of
Oconee units in accordance with these Technical Specifications will not create any failure modes not bounded by previously
evaluated accidents. Previously evaluated accidents assume an initial condition of power operation for loss of
main feedwater events. Providing for automatic initiation prior to criticality ensures operation within the bounds
of design analysis. Previously evaluated accidents also assume the removal of decay heat, following loss of normal
CCW flow, to be via the main steam safety relief valves to the atmosphere which eliminates the need for ECCW operability.
Consequently, this change will not create the possibility of a new or different kind of accident from any kind of accident
previously evaluated.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(3) [The amendment request would not] involve a significant reduction in a margin of safety.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The design basis of the EFW system is to supply feedwater to the steam generators in the event Main Feedwater is lost.
By providing clarification that manual initiation circuitry is operable prior to exceeding an RCS temperature of
250
<!-- PJG 0017 degreeslatlong -->
&cir;F and automatic initiation circuitry, due to low main feedwater discharge pressure or low hydraulic oil pressure,
is operable prior to criticality, there is no significant reduction in the margin of safety associated with this amendment
request. The ECCW system is designed to provide a means to remove decay heat without a loss of secondary side inventory.
However, analysis has shown that sufficient secondary side inventory exist, as specified by Technical Specification
3.4.4, to provide for coping with loss of station power events. Furthermore, even though this method of decay heat
removal is desirable, Oconee PRA [probabilistic risk assessment] studies do not model the loss of ECCW for accident
precursors since it is not required and margins of safety are not reduced if it is not available. Changes included within
this amendment request clarify existing requirements for the operability of secondary system for decay heat removal
based on previously evaluated accidents. As such, all margins of safety are preserved. Therefore, there will be no
reduction in any margin of safety.

The proposed amendment would revise Technical Specification (TS) sections 3.4.6.1 and 3.4.6.2 related to reactor

and definition sections. A new TS, section 3/4.5.4, is proposed to address reactor coolant pump seal injection flow.

As required by 10 CFR 50.91(a), the licensee has provided its analysis of the issue of no significant hazards consideration,
which is presented below:
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->
1. Does the change involve a significant increase in the probability or consequences of an accident previously evaluated?
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The probability of occurrence of a previously evaluated accident, i.e., loss of coolant accident (LOCA), is not increased
because the ability of the plant operators to detect RCS leakage and take appropriate corrective action is not changed.
The proposed change will continue to ensure that diverse means for detecting extremely small leaks are available
to plant operators. In 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
addition, the proposed amendment does not change the operational leakage limits. The seal injection flow limit is
not affected by this proposed change. Due to these three factors, the probability of occurrence of a LOCA is not increased.
The consequences of an accident previously evaluated are not significantly increased because the proposed changes
do not affect the ability of the various safety systems to perform their intended function. The leakage detection
monitors do not initiate any automatic function to mitigate the consequences of a LOCA. They provide an early indication
of RCS leakage. The operational leakage limits are not affected by this proposed change and they do not initiate any
automatic function to mitigate the consequences of a LOCA. The proposed change to the seal injection flow requirement
will continue to ensure that ECCS flow will be as assumed in the accident analyses.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Therefore, based on the continued ability of the leakage detection monitors and independent monitoring capabilities
to detect extremely small leaks, the fact that this proposed amendment does not change the operational leakage limits,
the seal injection flow limit is not affected by this proposed change, and that the proposed changes do not affect the
ability of the various safety systems to perform their intended functions, this proposed change does not involve
a significant increase in the probability or consequences of an accident previously evaluated.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
2. Does the change create the possibility of a new or different kind of accident from any accident previously evaluated?
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The proposed amendment does not change the plant configuration in a way which introduces a new potential hazard to
the plant. Since design requirement[s] continue to be met and the integrity of the RCS pressure boundary is not challenged,
no new failure mode has been created. As a result, an accident which is different than any already evaluated in the Updated
Final Safety Analysis Report (UFSAR) will not be created due to this change.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Therefore, the proposed change does not create the possibility of a new or different kind of accident from any accident
previously evaluated.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
3. Does the change involve a significant reduction in a margin of safety?
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The proposed change does not involve a significant reduction in a margin of safety since the operational leakage limits
will not be affected. Continued plant operation will not be permitted if operational leakage exceeds the current
technical specification limits. The operational leakage limits establish limits which ensure that any RCS leakage
does not compromise safety. The protection of the RCS pressure boundary from degradation and the core form [from]
inadequate cooling, in addition to preventing the accident analyses radiation release assumptions from being exceeded,
is the main purpose of the operational leakage limits. The ability to detect and quantify operational leakage allows
plant operators to perform actions to place the plant in a safe condition when leakage rate indicates possible RCS
pressure boundary degradation. The proposed change will continue to ensure that diverse measurement means are available
to provide the plant operators with an early indication of extremely small RCS leakage. Therefore, [the change is]
allowing action to be taken to place the plant in a safe condition when RCS leakage indicates possible RCS pressure
boundary leakage.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The proposed addition of the separate seal injection specification will not change the flow limit on seal injection.
The new specification will continue to ensure that seal injection flow is limited. This will ensure that sufficient
flow to the reactor core is provided during accident conditions. The proposed elimination of the Mode 4 applicability,
for seal injection flow specification, will not involve a significant reduction in the margin of safety since high
seal injection flow is less critical as a result of the lower initial RCS pressure and decay heat removal requirements
in Mode 4. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Therefore, this proposed change does not involve a significant reduction in a margin of safety.

The proposed admendment would revise the technical specifications (TSs) by relocating the seismic and meteorological
monitoring instrumentation and their associated requirements from the TSs to the Waterford 3 updated final safety
analysis report and plant procedures pursuant to the NRC final policy statement on TSs improvements for nuclear power
reactors. The final policy statement was published in the

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->
The proposed change relocates Seismic and Meteorological Monitoring Instrumentation requirements from the TS
to licensee controlled documents consistent with the NRC Policy Statement on Technical Specification Improvements.
Criterion 1 of the Policy Statement indicates that the TS should include installed instrumentation that is used to
detect, and indicate in the control room, a significant abnormal degradation of the reactor coolant pressure boundary.
This criterion is intended to ensure that the TS control those instruments specifically installed to detect excessive
reactor coolant system leakage. This criterion is not interpreted to include instrumentation used to detect precursors
to reactor coolant pressure boundary leakage (e.g., loose parts monitor, seismic instrumentation, valve position
indicators). Combustion Engineering and the NRC have previously determined that relocating Seismic and Meteorological
Monitoring Instrumentation requirements from the TS does not affect any material condition of the plant that could
directly contribute to causing or mitigating the effects of an accident.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Therefore, the proposed change will not involve a significant increase in the probability or consequences of any
accident previously evaluated.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The proposed change will not involve any design change or modification to the plant. The proposed change will not alter
the operation of the plant or the manner in which it is operated. Any subsequent change to the Seismic or Meteorological
Monitoring Instrumentation requirements will undergo a review in accordance with the criteria of 10 CFR 50.59 to
ensure that the change does not involve an unreviewed safety question. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Therefore, the proposed change will not create the possibility of a new or different kind of accident from any accident
previously evaluated.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The proposed change will relocate Seismic and Meteorological Monitoring Instrumentation requirements from the
TS to licensee controlled documents subject to the criteria of 10 CFR 50.59. The proposed change will have no adverse
impact on any protective boundary or safety limit.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

Description of amendment request:

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The proposed amendment would revise the technical specifications (TSs) to change three plant protection system
(PPS) trip setpoints to be consistent with the current setpoint/uncertainty methodology being implemented at Waterford

which is presented below:
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->
Implementing the proposed change will not affect any design basis accident. The revised trip and actuation setpoints
are based upon the same analytical limits that form the basis for the current trip and actuation setpoints. The design
basis for each trip and actuation setpoint was verified to be consistent with the appropriate accident analyses as
part of the process of revising the PPS setpoint analysis. The proposed changes in trip and actuation setpoints are
all in the conservative (away from the analytical limits) direction. Therefore, the proposed change will not involve
a significant increase in the probability or consequences of any previously analyzed accident.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Plant operation and the manner in which the plant is operated will not be altered as a result of implementing the proposed
change since no new system or design change is being implemented. Therefore, the proposed change will not create the
possibility of a new or different kind of accident from any accident previously evaluated.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The current safety margins of the affected trip setpoints and allowable values is preserved by the proposed change.
This is assured by retaining the current analytical limit for the affected parameters. Since the analytical limits
are not affected and the total channel uncertainty is increased, the margin of safety for the affected trip setpoints
and allowable values is preserved. Therefore, the proposed change will not involve a significant reduction in a margin
of safety.

(1) Operation of the facility in accordance with the proposed amendments would not involve a significant increase
in the probability or consequences of an accident previously evaluated.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The removal of cycle-specific Rod Bank Insertion limits and the K(Z) curve from the Turkey Point Units 3 and 4 Technical
Specifications is administrative in nature and has no impact on the probability or consequences of any Design Bases
Event (DBE) occurrences which was previously evaluated. The determination of the Rod Bank Insertion limits and K(Z)
curve will be performed using methodology approved by the NRC and poses no significant increase in the probability
or consequences of any accident previously evaluated. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Rod Bank Insertion limits and K(Z) curve will be evaluated every cycle to ensure proper compliance with the Updated
Final Safety Analysis Report (UFSAR). These limits will be evaluated in accordance with 10 CFR 50.59, which ensures
that the reload will not involve an increase in the probability of occurrences or consequences of an accident previously
evaluated. 10 CFR 50.59 (2) states that a proposed change involves an unreviewed safety question (i) if the probability
of occurrence or the consequences of an accident or malfunction of equipment important to safety previously evaluated
in the safety analysis report may be increased. Consequently, since any change to the reload core design analysis
must be evaluated relative to the more restrictive evaluation criterion of 10 CFR 50.59, then operation of the facility
in accordance with the proposed amendments would not involve a significant increase in the probability or consequences
of an accident previously evaluated.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(2) Operation of the facility in accordance with the proposed amendments would not create the possibility of a new

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The removal of the Rod Bank Insertion limits and K(Z) curve from the Technical Specifications is administrative in
nature and has no impact, nor does it contribute in any way to the possibility of a new or different kind of accident from
any accident previously evaluated. No new accident scenarios, failure mechanisms or limiting single failure events
are introduced as a result of the proposed change. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The generation of the Rod Bank Insertion limits and K(Z) curve will be performed using NRC-approved methodology and
are submitted to the NRC, as a revision to the COLR, to allow the NRC staff to trend. The Technical Specifications will
continue to require operation within the core operating limits and appropriate actions will be taken if these limits
are exceeded. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
10 CFR 50.59 permits a licensee to make changes in the facility as described in the safety analysis report without prior
Commission approval, provided that the proposed changes does not involve an unreviewed safety question. 10 CFR 50.59
(2) states that a proposed change involves an unreviewed safety question (ii) if a possibility for an accident or malfunction
of a different type than any evaluated previously in the safety analysis report may be created. Consequently, since
any change to the reload core design analysis must be evaluated relative to the more restrictive evaluation criterion
of 10 CFR 50.59, then operation of the facility in accordance with the proposed amendments would not create the possibility
of a new or different kind of accident from any accident previously evaluated. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(3) Operation of the facility in accordance with the proposed amendments would not involve a significant reduction
in a margin of safety.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The margin of safety is not affected by the removal of the Rod Bank Insertion limits and K(Z) curve from the Technical
Specifications. The methodology for the reload core design analysis have been approved by the NRC and does not constitute
a significant reduction in the margin of safety. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The supporting Technical Specification values are defined by the accident analyses which are performed to conservatively
bound the operating conditions defined by the Technical Specifications. The development of the limits for future
reloads will continue to conform to the methodology described in NRC approved documentation. In addition, each future
reload will involve a 10 CFR 50.59 review to assure that operation of the units within the cycle specific limits will
not involve a reduction in a margin of safety. 10 CFR 50.59 (2) states that a proposed change involves an unreviewed
safety question (iii) if the margin of safety as defined in the basis for any technical specification is reduced. Consequently,
since any change to the reload core design analysis must be evaluated relative to the more restrictive evaluation
criterion of 10 CFR 50.59, then operation of the facility in accordance with the proposed amendments would not involve
a significant reduction in a margin of safety.

Description of amendment request: 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The licensee proposes to change Turkey Point Units 3 and 4 Technical Specifications and its associated BASES, which
address the maximum allowed reactor thermal power operation with inoperable main steam safety valves (MSSVs). Westinghouse
issued Nuclear Safety Advisory Letter (NSAL) 94-001 which notified the licensee of a deficiency in the basis of the
Turkey Point Technical Specification 3/4.7.1, which allows the plant to operate at reduced power levels with a specified
number of MSSVs inoperable. This amendment request corrects the allowable power level with inoperable MSSVs.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The licensee also proposed changes to the TS 3.7.1.1 applicability statement to indicate that, for mode 3 only, the
actions are required when the Reactor Trip System breakers are in the closed position and the Control Rod Drive System
is capable of rod withdrawal.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Basis for proposed no significant hazards consideration determination: 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
As required by 10 CFR 50.91(a), the licensee has provided its analysis of the issue of no significant hazards consideration,
which is presented below:
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->
(1) Operation of the facility in accordance with the proposed amendments would not involve a significant increase
in the probability or consequences of an accident previously evaluated.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The proposed changes do not involve a significant increase in the probability or consequences of an accident previously
evaluated. The new power range neutron flux high setpoint values will ensure that the secondary side steam pressure
will remain below 110 percent of the design value following a Loss of Load/Turbine Trip event, when one or more main
steam safety valves (MSSVs) are declared inoperable. The proposed change will not impact the classification of the
Loss of Load/Turbine Trip event as a Condition II probability event (faults of moderate frequency) per ANSI - N18.2,
1973. Accordingly, since the new power range neutron flux setpoints will maintain the capability of the MSSVs to perform
their pressure relief function associated with a Loss of Load/Turbine Trip event, there will be no effect on the probability
or consequences of an accident previously evaluated.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In addition, the proposed change to the applicability statement of TS 3.7.1.1, will not effect the probability or
consequences of an accident previously evaluated, since the proposed plant condition with the reactor trip breakers
open and the rod control system not capable of withdrawing rods is an analyzed safe shutdown condition.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(2) Operation of the facility in accordance with the proposed amendments would not create the possibility of a new
or different kind of accident from any accident previously evaluated.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The proposed changes do not create the possibility of a new or different kind of accident from any accident previously
evaluated. The proposed changes do not involve any change to the configuration or method of operation of any plant
equipment, and no new failure modes have been defined for any plant system or component. The new power range neutron
flux high setpoints will maintain the capability of the MSSVs to perform their pressure relief function to ensure
the secondary side steam design pressure is not exceeded following a Loss of Load/Turbine Trip event. Therefore,
since the function of the MSSVs is unaffected by the proposed changes, the possibility of a new or different kind of
accident from any accident previously evaluated is not created.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In addition, the proposed change to the applicability statement of TS 3.7.1.1, will not create the possibility of
a new or different kind of accident from any accident previously evaluated, since the proposed plant condition with
the reactor trip breakers open and the rod control system not capable of withdrawing rods is an analyzed safe shutdown
condition.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(3) Operation of the facility in accordance with the proposed amendments would not involve a significant reduction
in a margin of safety.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The proposed changes to the Technical Specifications [do] not involve a significant reduction in a margin of safety.
The algorithm methodology used to calculate the new power range neutron flux high setpoints is conservative and bounding
since it is based on a number of inoperable MSSVs per loop; i.e., if only one MSSV in one loop is out of service, the applicable
power range setpoint would be the same as if one MSSV in each loop were out of service. Another conservatism with the
algorithm methodology is with the assumed minimum total steam flow rate capability of the operable MSSVs. The assumption
is that if one or more MSSVs are inoperable per loop, the inoperable MSSVs are the largest capacity MSSVs, regardless
of which capacity MSSVs are actually inoperable. Therefore, since the power range neutron flux setpoints calculated
for the proposed changes using the algorithm methodology are more conservative and ensure the secondary side steam
design pressure is not exceeded following a Loss of Load/Turbine Trip event, this proposed license amendment will
not involve a significant reduction in a margin of safety.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In addition, the proposed change to the applicability statement of TS 3.7.1.1, does not involve a significant reduction
in a margin of safety, since the proposed plant condition with the reactor trip breakers open and the rod control system
not capable of withdrawing rods is an analyzed safe shutdown condition.

Description of amendment request: 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The licensee proposes to change Turkey Point Units 3 and 4 Technical Specifications (TS) by revising Surveillance
Requirements 4.8.1.1.2e. and 4.8.1.1.2f., to delete the specific reference in the TS of the American Society for
Testing and Materials (ASTM) testing standard being used to meet TS testing requirements. The Emergency Diesel Generator
(EDG) fuel oil TS Surveillance Requirements will be replaced with a requirement to test the EDG fuel oil in accordance
with the Turkey Point Units 3 and 4 Diesel Fuel Oil Testing Program.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The licensee proposes the addition of ACTION statements g. and h. of TS 3.8.1.1 to address the required action in the
event the diesel fuel oil does not meet the Diesel Fuel Oil Testing Program limits. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Basis for proposed no significant hazards consideration determination: 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
As required by 10 CFR 50.91(a), the licensee has provided its analysis of the issue of no significant hazards consideration,
which is presented below:
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->
(1) Operation of the facility in accordance with the proposed amendments would not involve a significant increase
in the probability or consequences of an accident previously evaluated.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The proposed changes to the Technical Specifications will permit the Technical Specification required testing
of Emergency Diesel Generator (EDG) fuel oil in accordance with the Turkey Point Units 3 and 4 Diesel Fuel Oil Testing
Program. The proposed change will permit FPL to use more recent editions of the American Society for Testing and Materials
(ASTM) standards currently listed in Technical Specification Surveillance Requirements 4.8.1.1.2e. and 4.8.1.1.2f.
Prior to changing the Diesel Fuel Oil Testing Program, the proposed change will be evaluated pursuant to Title 10 Code
of Federal Regulations 50.59 (10 CFR 50.59), ``Changes, tests, and experiments.'' Title 10 CFR 50.59 permits a licensee
to make changes in the procedures as described in the safety analysis report without prior Commission approval, provided
that the proposed changes [do] not involve an unreviewed safety question.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Title 10 CFR 50.59(a)(2) states that a proposed change involves an unreviewed safety question (i) if the probability
of occurrence or the consequences of an accident or malfunction of equipment important to safety previously evaluated
in the safety analysis report may be increased. Consequently, since any change to the Diesel Fuel Oil Testing Program,
including the ASTM standard or ASTM edition standard to be used to evaluate EDG fuel oil acceptability, the change
must be evaluated relative to the more restrictive evaluation criterion of 10 CFR 50.59, then operation of the facility
in accordance with the proposed amendments would not involve a significant increase in the probability or consequences
of an accident previously evaluated. The EDG fuel oil TS Surveillance Requirements will be replaced with a requirement
to test the EDG fuel oil in accordance with the Turkey Point Units 3 and 4 Diesel Fuel Oil Testing Program.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
ACTION statement g. of TS 3.8.1.1 is added to address the required action in the event the new fuel oil properties do
not meet the Diesel Fuel Oil Testing Program limits. A failure to meet the API gravity, kinematic viscosity, flash
point or clarity limits is cause for rejecting the new fuel oil prior to the addition to the Diesel Fuel Oil Storage Tanks,
but does not represent a failure to meet the Limiting Condition for Operation (LCO) of TS 3.8.1.1, since the new fuel
oil has not been added to the storage tanks. Provided these new fuel oil properties are met subsequent to the addition
of the new fuel oil to the storage tanks, 30 days is provided to complete the analyses of the other fuel oil properties
specified in Table 1 of ASTM-D975-81, except sulfur which may be performed in accordance with ASTM-D1552-79 or ASTM-D2622-82.
In the event the other new fuel oil properties specified in Table 1 of ASTM-D975-81 are not met, ACTION statement g.
of TS 3.8.1.1 provides an additional 30 days to meet the Diesel Fuel Oil Testing Program limits. This additional 30
day period is acceptable because the fuel oil properties of interest, even if they are not within limits, would not
have an immediate effect on EDG operation.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
ACTION statement h. of TS 3.8.1.1 is added to address the required action in the event the stored fuel oil total particulates
does not meet the Diesel Fuel Oil Testing Program limits. Fuel oil degradation during long term storage shows up as
an increase in particulate, due mostly to oxidation. The presence of particulate does not mean the fuel oil will not
burn properly in a diesel engine. The frequency for performing surveillance on stored fuel oil is based on stored fuel
oil degradation trends which indicate that particulate concentration is unlikely to change significantly between
surveillances.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Prior to changing the Turkey Point Units 3 and 4 Diesel Fuel Oil Testing Program, FPL will need to determine if the proposed
program change is at least as, if not more, effective, in detecting unsatisfactory fuel oil. The EDGs will thus continue
to function as designed and the probability or consequences of previously evaluated accidents will be unaffected.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(2) Operation of the facility in accordance with the proposed amendments would not create the possibility of a new
or different kind of accident from any accident previously evaluated.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The proposed changes to the Technical Specifications will permit the Technical Specification required testing
of Emergency Diesel Generator fuel oil using more recent editions of the American Society for Testing and Materials
standards listed in Technical Specification Surveillance Requirements 4.8.1.1.2e. and 4.8.1.1.2f. Prior to changing
the edition of the previously approved ASTM standard being used to evaluate the EDG fuel oil, the proposed edition
standard will be evaluated pursuant to 10 CFR 50.59, ``Changes, tests, and experiments.'' Title 10 CFR 50.59 permits
a licensee to make changes in the procedures as described in the safety analysis report without prior Commission approval,
provided that the proposed changes does not involve an unreviewed safety question. Title 10 CFR 50.59(a)(2) states
that a proposed change involves an unreviewed safety question (ii) if a possibility for an accident or malfunction
of a different type than any evaluated previously in the safety analysis report may be created. Consequently, since
any change to the edition of the ASTM standard to be used to evaluate EDG fuel oil acceptability must be evaluated relative
to the more restrictive evaluation criterion of 10 CFR 50.59, then operation of the facility in accordance with the
proposed amendments would not create the possibility of a new or different kind of accident from any accident previously
evaluated.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
ACTION statement g. of TS 3.8.1.1 is added to address the required action in the event the new fuel oil properties do

do not involve a change in the design of any plant system or component, and since the proposed changes will need to evaluate
the effect of any ASTM standard edition change on the level of EDG reliability, the change proposed will not create
the possibility of a new or different kind of accident from any accident previously evaluated.

permits a licensee to make changes in the procedures as described in the safety analysis report without prior Commission
approval, provided that the proposed changes [do] not involve an unreviewed safety question. Title 10 CFR 50.59(a)(2)
states that a proposed change involves an unreviewed safety question (iii) if the margin of safety as defined in the
basis for any technical specification is reduced. Consequently, since any change to the edition of the ASTM standard

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The proposed amendments would revise Technical Specification (TS) 3/4.8.1.1, ``AC Sources Operating,'' and the
associated TS Bases for demonstrating the operability of the diesel generators (DGs), based upon three NRC guidelines:
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
A. Generic Letter (GL) 93-05, ``Line-Item Technical Specifications Improvements to Reduce Surveillance Requirements
for Testing During Power Operation.''
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
1. Delete from TS action statement a the requirement to test the DGs in the event of an inoperable offsite circuit.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
2. Eliminate from TS action statement b the need to test the operable DG if the other DG became inoperable due to an inoperable
support system or an independently testable component in addition to the existing provision excluding preplanned
preventive maintenance or testing. Furthermore, if
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the operable DG must be tested, it would be tested within 8 hours (rather than 24 hours) unless the absence of any potential
common mode failure for the remaining DG is demonstrated.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
3. Also eliminate from TS action statement c the need to test the operable DG if the other DG became inoperable due to
an inoperable support system or an independently testable component in addition to the existing provision excluding
preplanned preventive maintenance or testing. In addition, the operable DG would not have to be tested if the absence
of any potential common mode failure for the remaining DG is demonstrated. A reference to TS action statement a would
be deleted because of the proposed change to TS action statement a described above.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
4. Eliminate from TS action statement e the need to test the DGs when two offsite circuits are inoperable.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
5. Revise TS 4.8.1.1.2.g.2 to allow the DG to be gradually loaded, as opposed to a fast loading of 60 seconds or less to
an indicated value of 6100-7000 kw. This change would extend gradual loading of DGs (that GL 93-05 recommends for routine
monthly surveillance) to the 6-month surveillance.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
B. Regulatory Guide (RG) 1.9, Revision 3, ``Selection, Design, Qualification, and Testing of Emergency Diesel Generator
Units Used as Class 1E Onsite Electric Power Systems at Nuclear Power Plants,'' (insofar as this guide relates to reducing
DG stress and wear due to testing and the elimination of certain reporting requirements).
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
1. Incorporate into TS 4.8.1.1.2.a.4 the provision to perform routine monthly testing by gradually accelerating
the DG to operating speed, rather than requiring the DG to attain rated voltage and frequency within 11.4 seconds.
As a direct result of this proposed change, TS action statements b, c, and f would be revised to reference TS 4.8.1.1.2.g.1
instead of TS 4.8.1.1.2.a.4 in the event that an operable DG must be tested when the other DG is inoperable. This has
the effect of requiring the operable DG to be fast-started for testing pursuant to the action statement. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
2. In TS 4.8.1.1.2.h.7, separate the 24-hour endurance run from the hot restart test. As a result, create new TS 4.8.1.1.2.h.8
to require the hot restart test. The DG would be operated for a minimum of 2 hours at a load of 6800-7000 kw, and the DG would
be shut down. Within 5 minutes of shutdown, the DG would be restarted and required to attain rated voltage and frequency
within 11.4 seconds. Delete existing TS footnote ## (which provides for reperforming the hot restart test without
repeating the 24-hour endurance test) which is no longer required. Renumber existing TSs 4.8.1.1.2.h.8, .9, .10,
.11, and .12 to accommodate the addition of new TS 4.8.1.1.2.h.8. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
3. Delete TS 4.8.1.1.3, ``Reports.'' (This is also in accordance with the Improved Technical Specifications, Revision
0, dated September 28, 1992).
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
4. In TS 4.8.1.2, ``A. C. Sources Shutdown,'' delete the reference to deleted TS 4.8.1.1.3.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
C. NUMARC 87-00, Revision 1, ``Guidelines and Technical Bases for NUMARC Initiatives Addressing Station Blackout
at Light Water Reactors,'' (insofar as it relates to the test frequency for a problem DG). Specifically, TS Table 4.8-1,
``Diesel Generator Test Schedule,'' would be revised to incorporate the test schedule of Section D.2.4.4 of Appendix
D to NUMARC 87-00, Revision 1. Under the proposed schedule, testing pursuant to TS 4.8.1.1.2.a would be conducted
monthly provided the number of valid failures in the last 25 demands for a given DG is no more than 3. If the number of valid
failures is 4 or more, testing would be conducted at least once per 7 days (but at intervals of no less than 24 hours) until
7 consecutive failure-free starts from standby conditions and load-run demands have been performed. Note that both
NUMARC 87-00, Revision 1, and RG 1.9, Revision 3, use and define the terms ``start demand, start failure, load-run
demand, and load-run failure'' rather than the old RG 1.108 terminology of valid tests. In fact, Section D.2.4.4 of
Appendix D to NUMARC 87-00 refers to the last 25 ``demands'' rather than tests. Therefore, the proposed change to TS
Table 4.8-1 would count valid failures in terms of demands rather than valid tests. The criteria for determining the
number of valid failures and demands would be in accordance with RG 1.9, Revision 3.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->
1. The proposed changes do not involve a significant increase in the probability or consequences of an accident previously
evaluated. The proposed changes affect the required actions in response to inoperable offsite and onsite ac sources,
surveillance requirements for the emergency diesel generators, and reporting requirements for diesel generator
failures. The proposed changes are based on the recommendations of Regulatory Guide 1.9, Revision 3, NUMARC 87-00,
Revision 1, and Generic Letter 93-05. They are expected to result in improvements in diesel generator testing and
failure reporting and reduce diesel generator aging due to excessive testing. As such, the proposed changes should
result in improved diesel generator reliability, thereby providing additional assurance that the diesel generators
will be capable of performing their safety function. Therefore, the proposed changes will not significantly increase
the probability or consequences of any accident previously evaluated.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
2. The proposed changes do not create the possibility of a new or different kind of accident from any accident previously
evaluated. The proposed changes affect the action and surveillance requirements for the onsite and offsite ac sources.
Accordingly, the proposed changes do not involve any change to the configuration or method of operation of any plant
equipment, and no new failure modes have been defined for any plant system or component nor has any new limiting failure
been identified as a result of the proposed changes. Therefore, the proposed changes do not create the possibility
of a new or different kind of accident from any previously evaluated.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
3. The proposed changes do not involve a significant reduction in a margin of safety. The proposed changes are based
on existing regulatory guidance. Under the proposed changes, the emergency diesel generators will remain capable
of performing their safety function, and the effects of aging on the diesel generators will be reduced by eliminating
unnecessary testing. Therefore, the proposed changes do not involve a significant reduction in a margin of safety.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
DPR-73, a possession only license for the TMI-2 facility, held by General Public Utilities Nuclear Corporation (GPU

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
DPR-73 for TMI-2 to April 19, 2014. No other changes to the license or the Technical Specifications are proposed.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The TMI-2 facility is currently in long term storage. GPU Nuclear, the licensee, has named this storage period Post
Defueling Monitored Storage or PDMS. The licensee plans to maintain TMI-2 in PDMS until Three Mile Island Nuclear
Station Unit No. 1 (TMI-1) permanently ceases operation, at which time both TMI-1 and TMI-2 will be decommissioned
simultaneously. The TMI-1 Operating License expires on April 19, 2014.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->
10 CFR 50.92 provides the criteria which the Commission uses to perform a No Significant Hazards Consideration. 10
CFR 50.92 states that an amendment to a facility license involves No Significant Hazards if operation of the facility
in accordance with the proposed amendment would not:
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
1. Involve a significant increase in the probability or consequences of an accident previously evaluated, or
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
2. Create the possibility of a new or different kind of accident from any accident previously evaluated, or
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
3. Involve a significant reduction in a margin of safety.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The proposed modification of the expiration date of the TMI-2 License does not involve any physical changes to the
facility. All that is involved is an extension of the time TMI-2 would be in a monitored storage condition. Based on
this, GPU Nuclear concludes that the proposed change does not:
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
1. Involve a significant increase in the probability or consequences of an accident previously evaluated. Accident
evaluations for PDMS are provided in the PDMS Safety Analysis Report (SAR) and the PDMS Final Programmatic Environmental
Impact Statement, Supplement 3 (PEIS) dated August 1989. These documents evaluated monitored storage of TMI-2 for
extended periods of time and provide for surveillances to ensure monitored storage conditions are appropriately
maintained. The PDMS PEIS specifically evaluated monitored storage until 2014. No evaluated accident has a probability
or consequence that are increased significantly during the period 2009 to 2014 over the period before 2009. Therefore,
it can be concluded that this change does not involve a significant increase in the probability or consequences of
an accident previously evaluated.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
2. Create the possibility of a new or different kind of accident from any accident previously evaluated. As previously
stated, the act of modifying the expiration date of the TMI-2 License does not involve any physical changes to the facility
and therefore, the possibility of a new or different kind of accident is not created.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
3. Involve a significant reduction in the margin of safety during PDMS. The surveillances identified in the PDMS SAR
will be performed to ensure that the facility is maintained in the condition defined by the SAR. These conditions and
surveillances will continue to apply during the extended license. Therefore, there will not be a reduction in the
margin of safety.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Based on the above analysis, it is concluded that the proposed changes involve No Significant Hazards Consideration
as defined by 10 CFR 50.92.

As required by 10 CFR 50.91(a), the licensee has provided its analysis of the issue of no significant hazards consideration,
which is presented below:
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->
1) The proposed amendment does not involve a significant increase in the probability or consequences of an accident
previously evaluated. No physical changes will result from this amendment. The ESW system will still maintain its
ability to support various safety related equipment which is designed to mitigate the consequences of certain accidents
and transients. These safety related systems play no part in the probability of these accidents or transients occurring.
Since the ESW system will continue to fully support the cooling requirements of the safety related equipment which
mitigate the consequences of certain accidents and transients, this amendment will not affect the consequences
of these accidents and transients. The re-analysis of the component heat loads assumed worst case conditions and
involved conservative assumptions. Our continuing program for monitoring heat exchanger performance, which was
established in response to Generic Letter 89-13, ``Service Water System Problems Affecting Safety-Related Equipment,''
will continue to verify that the individual components are capable of performing their design function. Therefore,
the proposed amendment does not involve a change in the probability or consequences of an accident previously evaluated.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
2) The proposed license amendment does not create the possibility of a new or different kind of accident from any previously
evaluated. The safety function of the ESW system is unchanged. The revised flow requirements for the system have been
established using conservative assumptions and worst case heat loads and are appropriately documented in the FSAR
and plant procedures. This amendment will result in no physical changes to the ESW system and therefore, will not affect
its ability to continue to provide reliable cooling water. Consequently, the proposed license amendment does not
create the possibility of a new or different kind of accident from any previously evaluated.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
3) The proposed amendment will not reduce the margin of safety. The re-analysis of the ESW flow rate requirements and
component heat loads was performed using conservative assumptions and maximum component heat loads. The actual
operation of the ESW system will not be changed. Any degradation of ESW pump performance would be detected by the IST
program which requires quarterly testing of these pumps and monitoring of the pump's differential pressure and flow.
Deleting the requirement to perform the surveillance each week when river water temperature exceeds 80
<!-- PJG 0017 degreeslatlong -->
&cir;F will not reduce the margin of safety because even at a river water temperature of 95
<!-- PJG 0017 degreeslatlong -->
&cir;F, the required ESW flow to supply all the branches is well below the normal system flow rate of approximately
1100 gpm. Deleting the weekly surveillance will eliminate unnecessary testing of the ESW pumps, thereby reducing
wear on the pumps. Adding a surveillance requirement for river water temperature will formalize the recording of
water temperature every hour to assure acceptable ESW performance.

The proposed amendment would revise Technical Specification (TS) 3.2.7.1, ``Primary Coolant System Pressure Isolation
Valves.'' Specifically, TS Table 3.2.7.1, ``Primary Coolant System Pressure Isolation Valves,'' would be revised
to add Shutdown Cooling System (SCS) check valves 38-165, 166, 167, 168, 169, 170, 171, and 172 each with a maximum allowable
leakage rate of less than or equal to 0.375 gpm. The proposed amendment would add the check valves in lieu of replacing
the SCS isolation valves with ones that are 10 CFR Part 50, Appendix J, Type C air testable. The added check valves would
provide high pressure/low pressure interfaces between the high pressure Reactor Coolant System and the low pressure
Core Spray System. The addition of the check valves will allow utilization of the Core Spray System as a seal water system
for sealing the Shutdown Cooling isolation valves as permitted by Section III.C.3 of 10 CFR Part 50, Appendix J.

The operation of Nine Mile Point Unit 1, in accordance with the proposed amendment, will not involve a significant
increase in the probability or consequences of an accident previously evaluated.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The proposed change requires the addition of Primary Coolant System pressure isolation valves for the prevention
of an intersystem LOCA [loss-of-coolant accident]. The proposed addition does not affect operation of either the
Shutdown Cooling or Core Spray Systems. These changes do not alter any accident initiators or precursors and therefore
does not affect the probability of a previously evaluated accident.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Testing these valves in accordance with Specification 3.2.7.1 provides assurance that the Core Spray System will
not be damaged by an overpressurization event which could lead to potential loss of integrity of the system and subsequent
release of radioactivity. Thus, the addition of the valves would not increase the consequences of any accident. Therefore,
the operation of Nine Mile Point Unit 1, in accordance with the proposed amendment, will not involve a significant
increase in the probability or consequences of an accident previously evaluated.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The operation of Nine Mile Point Unit 1, in accordance with the proposed amendment, will not create the possibility
of a new or different kind of accident from any accident previously evaluated.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The proposed addition of Primary Coolant System pressure isolation valves, although a physical change, does not
alter the initial conditions used for any design basis accident. The check valves provide the high pressure/low pressure
isolation between the Reactor Coolant and Core Spray Systems. These valves will be subject to leak rate testing in
accordance with Specification 3.2.7.1. This ensures that an intersystem LOCA is prevented. The proposed change
has no effect on operation of either the Shutdown Cooling or Core Spray Systems. Therefore, the design capabilities
of these systems are not challenged in a manner previously assessed so as to create the possibility of a new or different
kind of accident. Accordingly, operation of Nine Mile Point Unit 1, in accordance with the proposed amendment, will
not create the possibility of a new or different kind of accident from any accident previously analyzed.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The proposed change which requires the addition of Primary Coolant System pressure isolation valves, ensures proper
isolation of a high pressure/low pressure interface between the Reactor Coolant and Core Spray Systems. The pressure
isolation valves will be leak tested in accordance with Specification 3.2.7.1. This provides assurance that the
Core Spray System will not be damaged by an overpressurization event and will not result in loss of integrity of the
system. Thus, the results of any event previously analyzed remains unchanged. Therefore, the operation of Nine Mile
Point Unit 1, in accordance with the proposed amendment will not involve a significant reduction in a margin of safety.

The proposed change will revise the current surveillance frequency which verifies area temperature limits at least

which is presented below:
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->
...The proposed change does not involve an SHC [significant hazards consideration] because the change would not:
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
1. Involve a significant increase in the probability or consequences of an accident previously evaluated. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The proposed change reduces the frequency at which area temperature monitoring must be verified when the temperature
data-logger alarm function is operable. For conditions where the temperature data-logger alarm function is inoperable,
the frequency at which normal ambient temperature is verified remains unchanged. In addition, the proposed change
does not affect any system, equipment, or component credited in any previous accident evaluation, any environmental
qualification or post-accident profiles. Therefore, the proposed change will not involve a significant increase
in the probability or consequences of an accident previously evaluated. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
2. Create the possibility of a new or different kind of accident from any previously evaluated. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The proposed change does not alter or affect the design, function, failure mode, or operation of the plant. There is
no change to the way in which the plant is operated and, therefore, no increase in the probability of plant operation
with any area temperature outside of its limits. Therefore, this change does not create the possibility of a new or
different kind of accident from those previously evaluated. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
3. Involve a significant reduction in a margin of safety.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The proposed change does not challenge or affect the performance of any of the protective boundaries, revise temperature
limits in the technical specifications, or perform any modifications that would increase the likelihood of technical
specification temperature limits being exceeded. The proposed change requires the data-logger alarm function
to be operable in order to relax the surveillance frequency. This alarm function provides continuous monitoring
that would detect temperature excursions prior to the current surveillance which does not credit operability of
the data-logger alarm function. Also, the proposed change does not increase the interval for which temperatures
could exceed technical specification limits. Therefore, the proposed change does not cause a reduction in the margin
of safety.

Description of amendment request: 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The proposed change revises the Technical Specifications to change the trip setpoint for the 4kV bus undervoltage
relay (for the grid degraded voltage) from its current value of [greater than or equal to] 3710 volts to its new setting
of [greater than or equal to] 3730 volts.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
As required by 10 CFR 50.91(a), the licensee has provided its analysis of the issue of no significant hazards consideration,
which is presented below:
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->
...The proposed change does not involve an SHC [significant hazards consideration] because the change does not:

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
1. Involve a significant increase in the probability or consequences of an accident previously evaluated. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The proposed change involves the modification of the undervoltage relay setpoint from 3710V to 3730V. The protection
provided by this system in unaffected and is still in accordance with the guidance provided in NRC Branch Technical
Position PSB-1. This refinement increases the Technical Specification minimum trip setpoint for the degraded voltage
relays on the 4kV safety buses. It does not detrimentally affect the safe operation of the plant, nor does this proposed
modification increase the probability or consequences of an accident previously evaluated. The actual trip setpoints
of the subject relays do not require any changes and are currently conservatively set at 3745V. The allowable value
of [greater than or equal to] 3706V remains unchanged. This slightly higher than required setting was chosen by NNECO
to provide added margin should an undervoltage condition be present. This higher setting will not cause more actuations
of the ESF [engineered safety feature] systems.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
2. Create the possibility of a new or different kind of accident from any accident previously evaluated. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The undervoltage protection system is provided to address the concerns identified in NRC Branch Technical Position
PSB-1 by providing a scheme to detect the loss of offsite power at the class 1E buses, and a second level of undervoltage
protection to protect class 1E equipment. The change in the setpoint will not affect the ability of this circuitry
to detect a loss of offsite power or to respond to an undervoltage condition.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Since the equipment will operate as previously described in the FSAR [Final Safety Analysis Report], and there are
no physical plant modifications required (the current setting at the undervoltage relay is 3745V), the proposed
amendment will not create the possibility of a new or different kind of accident from any accident previously evaluated.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
3. Involve a significant reduction in a margin of safety.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
These relays do not cause a loss of offsite power, nor do they cause a degraded voltage condition. These relays react
to conditions that have been placed upon the Plant. In the event that a degraded voltage condition exists on the 4kV
safety buses, alarms in the control room alert the operators of this condition. In addition, the Connecticut Valley
Electric Exchange (CONVEX), the system dispatch center for generation and VAR/voltage control, is aware of the minimum
voltage requirements for the three nuclear plants at the Millstone station and has a minimum target switchyard voltage
of 345kV. Under normal operation conditions the switchyard voltage would have to degrade below 328kV before one of
the 4kV safety buses would start to enter the degraded voltage level and trip the degraded voltage circuit. These administrative
controls help preclude a degraded voltage condition on the 4kV safety buses prior to actuation of the degraded voltage
protection circuits.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The proposed change of the 4kV degraded voltage minimum trip setpoint to 3730V from 3710V will not result in any physical
relay setting change. The existing trip setting for the 4kV degraded voltage relays have been conservatively set
at 3745V, while the existing allowable value remains unchanged at 3706V. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The response times or actuation logic of the degraded voltage protection circuit remains unaffected, therefore
revising the trip setpoint value in the Technical Specifications will not involve a significant reduction in the
margin of safety.

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
As required by 10 CFR 50.91(a), the licensee has provided its analysis of the issue of no significant hazards consideration,
which is presented below:
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->
1. The proposed amendment will not involve a significant increase in the probability or consequences of an accident
previously evaluated.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The purpose of the post accident monitoring equipment is to display unit variables that provide information required
by the control room operators during accident situations and as such help limit the consequences of an accident. The
proposed changes, which will allow continued plant operation with less than four core exit thermocouples per core
quadrant, have no impact on the probability of an accident because they are only used in response to accident situations.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Continued plant operation with the core exit thermocouple system in the degraded condition as allowed by the proposed
core exit thermocouple action statements would not affect the operators ability to monitor for inadequate core cooling
following an accident. At least two core exit thermocouples would be operable per core quadrant, a minimum of four
thermocouples would be available in the center region of the core and at least one thermocouple would be available
in each quadrant of the outside core region. The smaller size of the Prairie Island core, and therefore higher density
of thermocouples per unit of core area, provides additional assurance that core exit temperatures can be adequately
monitored with a reduced number of core exit thermocouples.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Alternate means of monitoring for inadequate core cooling would also be available. These include the reactor vessel
water level indication system, the subcooling margin monitors and wide range reactor coolant system temperature.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The combination of the remaining operable core exit thermocouples and the alternate monitoring capability will
ensure that the operators ability to identify inadequate core cooling in a timely manner and take appropriate corrective
action will not be impaired, and therefore; the proposed changes will have no significant impact on the consequences
of an accident.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The core exit thermocouples perform no active role in the mitigation of an accident. Their inoperability will not
affect the operability of any engineered safety features equipment or that equipments ability to mitigate the consequences
of an accident.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Therefore, for the reasons discussed above, the proposed changes will not significantly affect the probability
or consequences of an accident previously evaluated.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
2. The proposed amendment will not create the possibility of a new or different kind of accident from any accident previously
analyzed.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
There are no new failure modes or mechanisms associated with the proposed changes. The proposed changes do not involve
any modification of plant equipment or any changes in operational limits. The proposed changes only modify the requirements
for instrumentation used to monitor plant parameters during an accident. The core exit thermocouples are passive
monitoring devices, their failure or inoperability cannot result in a plant accident of any kind.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Therefore, for the reasons discussed above, the proposed changes do not create the possibility of a new or different
kind of accident from any previously evaluated, and the accident analyses presented in the Updated Safety Analysis
Report will remain bounding.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
3. The proposed amendment will not involve a significant reduction in the margin of safety.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Continued plant operation with the core exit thermocouple system in the degraded condition as allowed by the proposed

As required by 10 CFR 50.91(a), the licensee has provided its analysis of the issue of no significant hazards consideration,
which is presented below:
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->
1. The proposed Technical Specifications (TS) changes do not involve a significant increase in the probability or
consequences of an accident previously evaluated.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The TS change proposed is the relocation of the recirculation pump Motor-Generator (MG) set mechanical and electrical
stop and control rod block recirculation flow upscale trip setpoint values to the COLR. No physical plant equipment
change is proposed. The TS requirements for the setpoints and the associated surveillance requirements remain unchanged.
Only the location of the setpoint values will be changed. The subject setpoint values will become cycle depend[e]nt
and will be determined by NRC approved methods, as are the balance of setpoints and thermal limits found in the COLR.
However, the subject setpoint values are not modified as part of this TS change.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Therefore, the proposed TS change does not involve an increase in the probability or consequences of an accident previously

2. The proposed TS changes do not create the possibility of a new or different kind of accident from any accident previously

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The TS changes proposed are the relocation of the recirculation pump MG set mechanical and electrical stop and control
rod block recirculation flow upscale trip setpoint values to the COLR. No physical plant equipment change is part
of the proposed TS changes. The TS LCOs and surveillance requirements remain unchanged. The only change proposed
is the relocation of the subject setpoint values as noted above. These setpoint values have been determined in accordance
with previously NRC approved methods and assure sufficient operating margins in accordance with existing core design
methodology. Therefore, the proposed TS changes do not create the possibility of a new or different kind of accident
from any previously evaluated.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
This amendment will change the Technical Specification 4.0.5 for each unit to reflect NRC's policy with respect to
relief requests for the inservice inspection programs. Specifically, the change would clarify the fact that relief
requests for impracticable testing or surveillance requirements can be implemented prior to the Commission approval
of such requests.

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
As required by 10 CFR 50.91(a), the licensee has provided its analysis of the issue of no significant hazards consideration
which is presented below: 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->
1. Involve a significant increase in the probability or consequences of an accident previously evaluated.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The proposed changes are administrative in nature in that the changes eliminate any possibility of misinterpretation
of the ASME Code requirements that allow for a utility to submit relief requests to the Commission within one year and
allows for the implementation of these request[s] prior to Commission review and approval. The relief requests are
based on and provide for alternative testing based on industry practice that provides an equivalent level of quality
and safety as the Code requirement. The Commission will still provide acceptance of the relief requests in writing.
Therefore, it can be concluded that the proposed changes do not involve a significant increase in the probability
or consequences of an accident previously evaluated. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
2. Create the possibility or a new or different kind of accident from any accident previously evaluated.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
No new failure modes have been defined for any plant system or component important to safety nor has any new limiting
failure been identified as a result of the proposed changes. Therefore, it can be concluded that the proposed changes
do not create the possibility of a new or different kind of accident from those previously evaluated. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
3. Involve a significant reduction in a margin of safety.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The proposed changes are administrative in nature and do not adversely impact the plant's ability to meet applicable
regulatory requirements related to inservice testing or inspection. The proposed changes eliminate any possible
misinterpretation of the Code requirements regarding relief requests and do not reduce the protection of public
health and safety. Therefore, it can be concluded that the proposed changes do not involve a significant reduction
in a margin of safety.

The proposed amendment would change the requirement to perform the Channel Functional Test of the Power Operated

As required by 10 CFR 50.91(a), the licensee has provided its analysis of the issue of no significant hazards consideration,
which is presented below:
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->
1. Does not involve a significant increase in the probability or consequences of an accident previously evaluated.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
A change from quarterly (Q) to at least every 18 months (R) may appear to be non-conservative, at first; however, by
extending the surveillance requirement to cycle the PORV during non-power conditions, the change eliminates the
potential risk and consequences of having the valve sticking open at power or not fully closing (leaking). Therefore,
by extending the surveillance the probability and consequences of any previously analyzed accident is reduced,
since the testing would now be conducted in a non-power condition, and the margin to safety is increased. Consequently,
a net safety gain is realized by eliminating or minimizing these risks.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The added note for PORV block valve is included for consistency and alignment between the surveillance requirement
under this T/S (Table 4.3-11) with that of T/S surveillances 4.4.3.2 and 4.4.5.2 for Units 1 and 2 respectively.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Therefore, the proposed amendment does not involve a physical or procedural change to any structure, component,
or system that significantly affects accident/malfunction probabilities or consequences previously evaluated
in the UFSAR.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
2. Does not create the possibility of a new or different kind of accident from any accident previously evaluated.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The proposed changes do not introduce any design or physical configuration changes to the facility which could create
new accident scenarios.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
3. Does not involve a significant reduction in a margin of safety.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
As stated in response to question number 1 above, the proposed changes do not eliminate the required T/S surveillance
requirements. The first change eliminates the need to cycle the PORV valves through one complete cycle of full travel
at power. The second change allows for not having to perform a surveillance on a valve that it is being used as an isolation
point. The valve has been closed to comply with requirements of another T/S action statement. Therefore, the probability
and consequences of any previously analyzed accident is reduced, thus increasing the margin to safety.

1. The proposed amendment does not involve a significant increase in the probability or consequences of an accident
previously evaluated.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
This proposed change establishes a surveillance testing requirement and limiting condition for operation for the
Unit 3 480-volt load shedding logic system. This Technical Specification change will not introduce any new failure
mode and will not alter any assumptions previously made in evaluating the consequences of an accident. Accordingly,
this change does not affect any design limiting safety system settings or operating parameters. Furthermore, the
change does not modify or add any accident initiating events or parameters. Therefore, these proposed changes do
not involve an increase in the probability or consequences of an accident previously evaluated.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
2. The proposed amendment does not create the possibility of a new or different kind of accident from any accident previously
evaluated.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
This proposed change establishes a limiting condition for operation and a surveillance requirement for the Unit
3 480-volt load shedding logic system. The addition of a limiting condition for operation and surveillance requirement
will not adversely affect the operation of Unit 3 or the manner in which it is operated. Furthermore, the change does
not create a failure mode that can lead to an accident of a different type than previously evaluated. Therefore, the
proposed change does not create the possibility of a new or different kind of accident from any accident previously
evaluated.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
3. The proposed amendment does not involve a significant reduction in a margin of safety.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The addition of a limiting condition for operation and surveillance requirement will not reduce the margin of safety.
The testing of the 480-volt load shedding logic on an 18-month interval is consistent with BWR/4 (NUREG-1433) Standard
Technical Specifications. These are based on the guidance set forth in NRC Regulatory Guide 1.108, ``Periodic Testing
of Diesel Generator Units Used as Onsite Electric Power Systems at Nuclear Power Plants.'' The addition of a limiting
condition for operation establishes a minimum acceptable level of performance for the 480-volt load shedding logic
system. Thus, the ability of the Emergency Diesel Generators to supply power during a loss of offsite power coincident
with a design basis accident is assured.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Furthermore, no reductions in the requirements or setpoints of the equipment supplied by the Emergency Diesel Generators
are made which could result in a reduction in the margin of safety. Therefore, this proposed change does not involve
a reduction in the margin of safety.

Brief description of amendments:

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The proposed changes would revise the Comanche Peak Steam Electric Station (CPSES), Units 1 and 2, Technical Specifications
(TS) to (1) allow a one-hour allowed outage time (AOT) following discovery of a closed cold leg injection accumulator
discharge isolation in Modes 1, 2, or 3; (2) eliminate the redundant requirement to reverify accumulator boron concentration
following fill from the refueling water storage tank (RWST); (3) relocate the accumulator water level and pressure
channel analog channel operational test (ACOT) and channel calibration from the CPSES Technical Specifications
to an administratively controlled program; (4) change the accumulator limits to analysis values rather than indicated
values; and (5) reduce the inspection frequency following containment entries.

Basis for proposed no significant hazards consideration determination: 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
As required by 10 CFR 50.91(a), the licensee has provided its analysis of the issue of no significant hazards consideration,
which is presented below:
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->
1. The proposed changes do not involve a significant increase in the probability or consequences of a previously evaluated
accident.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The current requirement to immediately open a cold leg accumulator discharge isolation valve (or shut down the unit)
upon discovery that the valve is closed is modified by the requested change to provide a one hour allowed outage time
(AOT) prior to requiring a unit shutdown. This change is consistent with NUREG-1431. The currently required action
is more restrictive than that required by CPSES Technical Specification 3.0.3, that specifies the action required
if an LCO [Limiting Condition for Operation] and its associated action requirements are not met and which provides
a one hour AOT prior to taking steps to place the plant in Mode 3 within the following 6 hours. Following this requested
change, the required actions for an accumulator declared inoperable due to a closed discharge isolation valve will
be identical to those actions required for inoperability for other reasons, with the exception of the accumulator
boron concentration being out of specification that has an AOT of 72 hours. Changing the AOT from ``immediate'' to
one hour does not affect the probability of an accident. The only previously evaluated accident that is potentially
impacted is the Loss of Coolant Accident (LOCA). With all valves open and thus all accumulators available, a potential
LOCA is bounded by the existing accident analyses. With one accumulator discharge isolation valve closed and thus
one accumulator not available, the consequences of a LOCA could be more severe; however, this requested amendment
does not create this scenario. In other words, although the change in AOT may slightly increase the probability that,
were a LOCA to occur, an accumulator would not be available (see the response to [number] 3 below), it does not involve
a significant increase in the consequences of an accident previously evaluated.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The requirement to test the accumulator boron concentration following a 101 gallon or greater solution volume increase
is modified by the requested change to exclude volume additions from the Refueling Water Storage Tank (RWST). Since
the RWST boron concentration must be confirmed to satisfy the limits for the accumulators, there is no impact on the
probability or consequences of any accident.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The relocation of the accumulator water level and pressure channel ACOT and Channel Calibration from CPSES Technical
Specifications to an administratively controlled program is essentially an administrative change. Because proper
tests will still be performed, there is no impact on the probability or consequences of any accident.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

The requested change to reduce the containment debris inspections from ``at the completion of every entry'' to ``[a]t
least once daily'' will require fewer inspections and is consistent with SR [Surveillance Requirement] 4.6.1.3
for the containment air locks. The accident of concern is a LOCA and these inspections have no impact on the probability
of a LOCA. Performing fewer inspections would slightly increase the possibility that, should a LOCA occur, there
could be debris in containment which could be transported to and partially clog the containment sump. However, inspecting
at least daily if containment entries have been made is adequate and is justified by the reduced total radiation exposure
for plant personnel. The inspections conducted at least daily assures that there is not a significant increase in
the consequence of any accident.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The requested changes do not modify the existing LCOs for Technical Specifications 3.5.1 and 3.5.2 with the exception
of the replacement of ``indicated'' values with analysis values in LCO 3.5.1, consistent with the relocation of the
SRs for accumulator instrumentation. The requested changes are consistent with NUREG-1431 and GL 93-05, and, as
such, have already been generically assessed by the NRC. It is concluded that the requested changes do not involve
a significant increase in the probability or consequences of an accident previously evaluated.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
2. The proposed changes do not create the possibility of a new or different kind of accident from any previously evaluated
accident.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The only requested change that modifies current operation of the plant is the requested one hour alowed outage time
for action following discovery of a closed cold leg accumulator discharge isolation valve. The requested one hour
completion time to open the valve continues to ensure that prompt action will be taken to return the inoperable accumulator
to an operable status, minimizing the potential for exposure of the plant to a LOCA under this condition. In addition,
as LCO 3.5.1a will continue to require that the accumulator discharge isolation valve be open with power removed from
the valve operator, the probability of the discharge isolation valve being closed in Modes 1, 2, or 3 will remain low.
This change in current operation does not create the possibility of a new or different kind of accident.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The requested slight reduction in the containment inspection frequencies specified in SR 4.5.2 only serves to reduce
the number of unnecessary inspections. It does not make substantial changes to the inspection requirements, nor
does it change the method of performing these requirements. Thus, the requested change does not create the possibility
of a new or different kind of accident.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
No significant changes to the limiting conditions for operation of the accumulators or the emergency core cooling
system are requested as part of this amendment request. The requested changes do not involve any physical changes
to the plant. The requested changes are consistent with NUREG-1431 and GL 93-05, and, as such, have already been generically
assessed by the NRC. Thus, the requested changes do not create the possibility of a new or different kind of accident
from any accident previously evaluated.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
3. The proposed changes do not involve a significant reduction in the margin of safety.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The only requested change that modifies current operation of the plant is the requested one hour allowed outage time
for action following discovery of a closed cold leg accumulator discharge isolation valve. As noted in the response
to [number] 1 above, this requested change in AOT does not significantly affect the probability or consequences of
an accident, but does increase the possibility that, should a LOCA occur, one of the accumulators may not be available
to help mitigate the consequences of the accident. However, the requested one hour completion time to open the valve
continues to ensure that prompt action will be taken to return the inoperable accumulator to an operable status, minimizing
the potential for exposure of the plant to a LOCA under this condition. In addition, as LCO 3.5.1a will continue to require
that the accumulator discharge isolation valve be open with power removed from the valve operator, the probability
of the discharge isolation valve being closed in Modes 1, 2, or 3 will remain low. Considering the controls above and
the fact that the requested action statement is consistent with TS 3.0.3, it is concluded that the requested change
does not involve a significant reduction in the margin of safety.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The requested slight reduction in the containment inspection frequencies specified in SR 4.5.2 only serves to reduce
the number of unnecessary inspections conducted and reduce the personnel exposure associated with the inspections.
As adequate inspections will continue to be conducted, this requested change does not involve a significant reduction
in a margin of safety.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
No significant changes to the limiting conditions for operation of the accumulators or the emergency core cooling
systems are requested as part of this amendment request. The requested changes are consistent with NUREG-1366, NUREG-1431
and GL 93-05, and, as such, have already been generically assessed by the NRC. Thus, it is concluded that the requested
changes do not involve a significant reduction in the margin of safety.

Brief description of amendments: 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The proposed amendments would revise the technical specifications by changing the frequency of auxiliary feedwater
pump operational testing from monthly to quarterly.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Basis for proposed no significant hazards consideration determination: 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
As required by 10 CFR 50.91(a), the licensee has provided its analysis of the issue of no significant hazards consideration,
which is presented below:
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->
1. The proposed change does not involve a significant increase in the probability or consequences or a previously
evaluated accident.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Because the Auxiliary Feedwater System pumps are provided to mitigate certain accidents, altering the test frequency
of the pumps will not impact the probability of an accident. The Auxiliary Feedwater System pumps will continue to
be tested quarterly on a staggered basis to the same standards applied to safety-related pumps as defined by ASME Section
XI. Satisfactory completion of the testing in accordance with the Code is used as verification that safety-related
pumps will be available to perform their intended function. Quarterly testing of the Auxiliary Feedwater System
pumps on a staggered basis, therefore, will continue to assure that the Auxiliary Feedwater System will be capable
of performing its intended function. It is thus concluded that the requested change will not involve a significant
increase in the probability of occurrence or consequences of an accident previously evaluated.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
2. The proposed changes do not create the possibility of a new or different kind of accident from any accident previously
evaluated.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Changing the surveillance test frequency of the Auxiliary Feedwater Pumps does not involve any physical modification
of the plant or result in a change in a method of operation. Therefore, it is concluded that the requested change does
not create the possibility of a new or different kind of accident from any accident previously evaluated.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
3. The proposed changes do not involve a significant reduction in a margin of safety.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Changing the surveillance testing frequency of the Auxiliary Feedwater System pumps does not affect any safety limits
or any limiting safety system settings. System operating parameters are unaffected. The availability of equipment
required to mitigate or assess the consequence of an accident is not reduced; in fact the availability is increased
because the system is rendered inoperable on a quarterly basis to perform pump testing, rather than a monthly basis.
Further, vibration testing being the most effective early indication of gradual pump degradation continues to be
performed on the same frequency. Quarterly testing of the Auxiliary Feedwater pumps on a staggered basis in accordance
with the criteria specified in the ASME Section XI code provides adequate assurance that the Auxiliary Feedwater
System pumps are capable of performing their intended function. Thus, its [sic] is concluded that the requested change
does not involved [sic] a significant reduction in a margin of safety.

Brief description of amendments:

The proposed amendments would revise the technical specifications to reduce the number of fast starts currently

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Basis for proposed no significant hazards consideration determination: 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
As required by 10 CFR 50.91(a), the licensee has provided its analysis of the issue of no significant hazards consideration,
which is presented below:
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->
1. The proposed changes do not involve a significant increase in the probability or consequences of a previously evaluated
accident.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
This change reduces the number of ``fast starts'' required on the EDGs and allows the EDGs to be tested using ``slow
starts.'' Reducing the number of ``fast starts'' (required to start in 10 seconds or less) will reduce the wear on the
EDGs primarily by minimizing coking of fuel in the cylinder and preventing premature wearing of the turbocharger
thrust bearing. This increases engine reliability and availability. A ``slow start'' may require that the EDG be
taken out of service to perform the test if the EDG start time is not 10 seconds or less. TU Electric feels that testing
the ``fast start'' capability of the EDG every 184 days will maintain its present level of reliability. The period
of time in which the EDG is actually inoperable due to testing (i.e., may not start and be ready to load in 10 seconds)
is quite short. Overall the reliability and the availability of the EDG will be increased.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The impact of the EDGs on the postulated accidents is directly related to their reliability and availability. Therefore,
the proposed reduction in the number of ``fast starts'' does not involve a significant increase in the probability
or consequences of any previously evaluated accident.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
2. The proposed changes do not create the possibility of a new or different kind of accident from any previously evaluated
accident. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The revised testing allowed by this Technical Specification change does not create a new or different kind of accident.
The EDGs are primarily accident mitigation components. The potential failure of EDGs have already been assessed
in the CPSES design.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
3. The proposed changes do not involve a significant reduction in the margin of safety.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The only aspect of this change that could adversely affect the margin of safety is the potential impact on the start
time of the engine. The start time of the engine is not expected to exceed the assumption in the accident analyses except
possibly in the short period of time required to perform the ``slow start'' test. If the EDG does not start in 10 seconds
or less under these conditions, the EDG is declared inoperable, as allowed by the Technical Specifications, to perform
the ``slow start'' test. Because these periods of inoperability are only implemented as allowed by the Technical
Specifications, there is no impact on the margin of safety. The margin of safety established by the assumed EDG availability
will be enhanced by the increased reliability and availability of the EDGs.

1. The proposed changes do not involve a significant increase in the probability or consequences of a previously evaluated
accident.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
This proposed amendment involves a consolidation of previous unit staff qualification requirements into one source
document, and a relocation of training requirements to a more appropriate license basis document. The qualification
requirements of the unit staff remains the same as the existing requirements, and the relocation of the training requirements
does not change the scope of the program as it now exists. The relocated training program requirements retain adequate
administrative and regulatory controls to ensure the plant is not placed in an unanalyzed condition.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
These changes are administrative in nature. They remain within the assumptions of the current accident analysis.
As a result, they do not increase the probability or consequences of an accident previously evaluated.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
2. The proposed changes do not create the possibility of a new or different kind of accident from any previously evaluated
accident.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
These changes are administrative in nature. They merely consolidate qualification requirements and relocate training
requirements. The relocated program requirements retain adequate administrative and regulatory controls to ensure
the plant is not introduced to an unreviewed safety question.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
These changes are administrative in nature. They do not introduce any new initiating events. As a result, they do not
create a new or different kind of accident from any accident previously evaluated.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
3. The proposed changes do not involve a signficant reduction in a margin of safety.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
These changes are administrative in nature and have no impact on actual plant protection or safety actuation systems,
or the assumed actions performed in accordance with normal, abnormal, or emergency operating procedures. There
are adequate regulatory and plant configuration controls existing to ensure there is no impact on the plant margin
of safety.

Description of amendment request: 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The proposed amendment would revise Kewaunee Nuclear Power Plant (KNPP) Technical Specification (TS) by adding
requirements for the steam exclusion system. The new TS addresses the steam exclusion system (TS 3.15) and the surveillance
on the steam exclusion system (TS 4.15). This system was not previously addressed by the TS.

Basis for proposed no significant hazards consideration determination: 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
As required by 10 CFR 50.91(a), the licensee has provided its analysis of the issue of no significant hazards consideration
which is presented below:
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->
A) TS 3.15 Steam Exclusion System (New)
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The proposed change was reviewed in accordance with the provisions of 10 CFR 50.92 to show no significant hazards exist.
The proposed change will not:
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
1) Involve a significant increase in the probability or consequences of an accident previously evaluated. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The intent of this new specification is to specify the operability requirements for the Steam Exclusion System and
to demonstrate the acceptability of removing the Steam Exclusion System from service for short periods of time.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The proposed change will not significantly increase the probability of an accident previously evaluated. The accident
under consideration is a high energy line break outside of containment. Allowing a steam exclusion boundary to be
inoperable for a short period of time has no effect on the probability of occurrence of a high energy line break outside
of containment.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The proposed change will not significantly increase the consequences of an accident previously evaluated. Again,
the accident under consideration is a high energy line break outside of containment. Calculations conclude that
the core damage frequency for a high energy line break outside of containment with a non-redundant steam exclusion
boundary open is 2.57E-8 per 12-hour period. Further conservative assumptions of one non-redundant steam exclusion
boundary being open 12 hours per day, 5 days per week, 52 weeks per year results in a core damage frequency of 6.68E-6
per year. This analysis was conservatively calculated taking minimal credit for mitigating the accident, and is
considered to be an acceptable level of risk on an annual basis. A safety factor of five was applied to NUREG/CR-4550
data to determine the initiating event frequency of a high energy line break. This calculation supports the conclusion
that this addition to the Technical Specifications will not result in a significant increase in the probability or
consequences of an high energy line break outside of containment.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Furthermore, calculations conclude that the core damage frequency for a high energy line break outside of containment
with one of two redundant steam exclusion boundaries open is 4.62E-10 per 72-hour period. Further conservative assumptions
of one redundant steam exclusion damper being open 24 hours per day, 5 days per week, 52 weeks per year results in a core
damage frequency of 4.00E-8 per year. This analysis was conservatively calculated taking minimal credit for mitigating
the accident, and is also considered to be an acceptable level of risk on an annual basis. Again, a safety factor of five
was applied to NUREG/CR-4550 data to determine the initiating event frequency of a high energy line break. This calculation
also supports the conclusion that this addition to the Technical Specifications will not result in a significant
increase in the probability or consequences of an high energy line break outside of containment.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Specific requirements for the Steam Exclusion System do not currently exist in the Technical Specifications. Addition
of TS 3.15 is an enhancement to the Kewaunee Technical Specifications, and providing this information for the plant
staff and operators will not significantly increase the probability or consequences of an accident previously evaluated,
nor will it adversely affect the health and safety of the public.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
2) Create the possibility of a new or different kind of accident from any accident previously evaluated.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The proposed amendment does not alter the plant configuration, operating setpoints or overall plant performance.
Therefore, it cannot create the possibility of a new or different kind of accident from any accident previously evaluated.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
3) Involve a significant reduction in the margin of safety. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Addition of the specification is an enhancement to the Technical Specifications and does not alter input to the safety
analysis. Furthermore, the supporting analysis demonstrates an acceptable level of risk for removing components
from service for limited periods of time. Therefore, it will not involve a significant reduction in the margin of safety.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Additionally, the proposed change is similar to example C.2.e(ii) in 51 FR 7751. Example C.2.e(ii) states that changes
that constitute an additional limitation, restriction or control not presently included in the TS's are not likely
to involve a significant hazard.

B) S 4.15 Steam Exclusion System (New) 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The proposed change was reviewed in accordance with the provisions of 10 CFR 50.92 to show no significant hazards exist.
The proposed change will not:
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
1) Involve a significant increase in the probability or consequences of an accident previously evaluated. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The proposed change will not significantly increase the probability or consequences of an accident previously evaluated.
The accident under consideration is a high energy line break outside of containment. The performance of periodic
surveillance requirements, testing which verifies that components in the Steam Exclusion System are operating
properly, cannot significantly increase the probability or consequences of a high energy line break, nor will it
adversely affect the health and safety of the public.

2) Create the possibility of a new or different kind of accident from any accident previously evaluated.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The proposed amendment does not alter the plant configuration, operating setpoints or overall plant performance.
Therefore, it cannot create the possibility of a new or different kind of accident from any accident previously evaluated.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
3) Involve a significant reduction in the margin of safety. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Addition of the specification is an enhancement to the Kewaunee Technical Specifications and does not alter input
to the safety analysis. Therefore, it will not involve a significant reduction in the margin of safety.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Additionally, the proposed change is similar to example C.2.e(ii) in 51 FR 7751. Example C.2.e(ii) states that changes

Description of amendment request: 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The proposed amendment would revise Kewaunee Nuclear Power Plant (KNPP) Technical Specification (TS) Sections
2.3, 3.6, and 4.6 by correcting minor typographical errors and format inconsistencies. These changes are being proposed
as a part of the licensee's ongoing effort to revise each section of the KNPP TS to achieve a consistent format and to
convert the entire document to Word Perfect. In addition, changes to the basis for TS Sections 2.3, 3.6, and 4.6 have
also been proposed.

Basis for proposed no significant hazards consideration determination: 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
As required by 10 CFR 50.91(a), the licensee has provided its analysis of the issue of no significant hazards consideration
which is presented below:
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->
The proposed changes were reviewed in accordance with the provisions of 10 CFR 50.92 to show no significant hazards
exist. The proposed changes will not:
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
1) involve a significant increase in the probability or consequences of an accident previously evaluated.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
2) create the possibility of a new or different kind of accident from any accident previously evaluated.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
3) involve a significant reduction in the margin of safety.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
These proposed changes involve the conversion of the TS to the Word Perfect format now being used at WPSC. Minor typographical
errors and format inconsistencies were corrected. These proposed changes are administrative in nature; accordingly,
these proposed changes do not involve a significant hazards consideration. Additionally, the proposed changes
are similar to example C.2.e.(i) in 51 FR 7751. Example C.2.e.(i) states that changes which are purely administrative
in nature; i.e., to achieve consistency throughout the Technical Specifications, correct an error, or a change in
nomenclature, are not likely to involve a significant hazard.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The proposed amendment would modify Technical Specification (TS) Figure 3.2-1, ``Reactor Coolant Cold Leg Temperature
vs. Core Power Level.'' Specifically, the minimum cold leg temperature for core power levels between 90 percent and
100 percent would be changed to 552
<!-- PJG 0017 degreeslatlong -->
&cir;F (which is a reduction of 10
<!-- PJG 0017 degreeslatlong -->
&cir;F from the previous TS requirement). This TS change permits reactor operation at full power with a lower reactor
coolant temperature to minimize potential steam generator tube degradation.

plan for the protection of cultural resources on the Callaway Plant site. The amendment request summarizes the plan
that provides the status and disposition of each portion of the current Appendix B sections related to cultural resources.

Finally, the amendments eliminate fast loading of EDGs except for the Loss of Offsite Power test and separate the hot
restart test from the 24-hour loaded test run of the EDGs. The changes are consistent with NRC Generic Letter 93-05
dated September 27, 1993.

Notice Of Issuance Of Amendments To Facility Operating Licenses And Final Determination Of No Significant Hazards
Consideration And Opportunity For A Hearing (Exigent Public Announcement Or Emergency Circumstances)
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
During the period since publication of the last biweekly notice, the Commission has issued the following amendments.
The Commission has determined for each of these amendments that the application for the amendment complies with the
standards and requirements of the Atomic Energy Act of 1954, as amended (the Act), and the Commission's rules and regulations.
The Commission has made appropriate findings as required by the Act and the Commission's rules and regulations in
10 CFR Chapter I, which are set forth in the license amendment. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Because of exigent or emergency circumstances associated with the date the amendment was needed, there was not time
for the Commission to publish, for public comment before issuance, its usual 30-day Notice of Consideration of Issuance
of Amendment, Proposed No Significant Hazards Consideration Determination, and Opportunity for a Hearing. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
For exigent circumstances, the Commission has either issued a 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 -->
Federal Register 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
notice providing opportunity for public comment or has used local media to provide notice to the public in the area
surrounding a licensee's facility of the licensee's application and of the Commission's proposed determination
of no significant hazards consideration. The Commission has provided a reasonable opportunity for the public to
comment, using its best efforts to make available to the public means of communication for the public to respond quickly,
and in the case of telephone comments, the comments have been recorded or transcribed as appropriate and the licensee
has been informed of the public comments.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In circumstances where failure to act in a timely way would have resulted, for example, in derating or shutdown of a
nuclear power plant or in prevention of either resumption of operation or of increase in power output up to the plant's
licensed power level, the Commission may not have had an opportunity to provide for public comment on its no significant
hazards consideration determination. In such case, the license amendment has been issued without opportunity for
comment. If there has been some time for public comment but less than 30 days, the Commission may provide an opportunity
for public comment. If comments have been requested, it is so stated. In either event, the State has been consulted
by telephone whenever possible.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Under its regulations, the Commission may issue and make an amendment immediately effective, notwithstanding the
pendency before it of a request for a hearing from any person, in advance of the holding and completion of any required
hearing, where it has determined that no significant hazards consideration is involved. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Commission has applied the standards of 10 CFR 50.92 and has made a final determination that the amendment involves
no significant hazards consideration. The basis for this determination is contained in the documents related to
this action. Accordingly, the amendments have been issued and made effective as indicated. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Unless otherwise indicated, the Commission has determined that these amendments satisfy the criteria for categorical
exclusion in accordance with 10 CFR 51.22. Therefore, pursuant to 10 CFR 51.22(b), no environmental impact statement
or environmental assessment need be prepared for these amendments. If the Commission has prepared an environmental
assessment under the special circumstances provision in 10 CFR 51.12(b) and has made a determination based on that
assessment, it is so indicated.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
For further details with respect to the action see (1) the application for amendment, (2) the amendment to Facility
Operating License, and (3) the Commission's related letter, Safety Evaluation and/or Environmental Assessment,
as indicated. All of these items are available for public inspection at the Commission's Public Document Room, the
Gelman Building, 2120 L Street, NW., Washington, DC 20555, and at the local public document room for the particular
facility involved. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Commission is also offering an opportunity for a hearing with respect to the issuance of the amendment. By September
2, 1994, the licensee may file a request for a hearing with respect to issuance of the amendment to the subject facility
operating license and any person whose interest may be affected by this proceeding and who wishes to participate as
a party in the proceeding must file a written request for a hearing and a petition for leave to intervene. Requests for
a hearing and a petition for leave to intervene shall be filed in accordance with the Commission's ``Rules of Practice
for Domestic Licensing Proceedings'' in 10 CFR Part 2. Interested persons should consult a current copy of 10 CFR 2.714
which is available at the Commission's Public Document Room, the Gelman Building, 2120 L Street, NW., Washington,
DC 20555 and at the local public document room for the particular facility involved. If a request for a hearing or petition
for leave to intervene is filed by the above date, the Commission or an Atomic Safety and Licensing Board, designated
by the Commission or by the Chairman of the Atomic Safety and Licensing Board Panel, will rule on the request and/or
petition; and the Secretary or the designated Atomic Safety and Licensing Board will issue a notice of a hearing or
an appropriate order. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
As required by 10 CFR 2.714, a petition for leave to intervene shall set forth with particularity the interest of the
petitioner in the proceeding, and how that interest may be affected by the results of the proceeding. The petition
should specifically explain the reasons why intervention should be permitted with particular reference to the following
factors: (1) the nature of the petitioner's right under the Act to be made a party to the proceeding; (2) the nature and
extent of the petitioner's property, financial, or other interest in the proceeding; and (3) the possible effect
of any order which may be entered in the proceeding on the petitioner's interest. The petition should also identify
the specific aspect(s) of the subject matter of the proceeding as to which petitioner wishes to intervene. Any person
who has filed a petition for leave to intervene or who has been admitted as a party may amend the petition without requesting
leave of the Board up to 15 days prior to the first prehearing conference scheduled in the proceeding, but such an amended
petition must satisfy the specificity requirements described above.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Not later than 15 days prior to the first prehearing conference scheduled in the proceeding, a petitioner shall file
a supplement to the petition to intervene which must include a list of the contentions which are sought to be litigated
in the matter. Each contention must consist of a specific statement of the issue of law or fact to be raised or controverted.
In addition, the petitioner shall provide a brief explanation of the bases of the contention and a concise statement
of the alleged facts or expert opinion which support the contention and on which the petitioner intends to rely in proving
the contention at the hearing. The petitioner must also provide references to those specific sources and documents
of which the petitioner is aware and on which the petitioner intends to rely to establish those facts or expert opinion.
Petitioner must provide sufficient information to show that a genuine dispute exists with the applicant on a material
issue of law or fact. Contentions shall be limited to matters within the scope of the amendment under consideration.
The contention must be one which, if proven, would entitle the petitioner to relief. A petitioner who fails to file
such a supplement which satisfies these requirements with respect to at least one contention will not be permitted
to participate as a party. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Those permitted to intervene become parties to the proceeding, subject to any limitations in the order granting leave
to intervene, and have the opportunity to participate fully in the conduct of the hearing, including the opportunity
to present evidence and cross-examine witnesses. Since the Commission has made a final determination that the amendment
involves no significant hazards consideration, if a hearing is requested, it will not stay the effectiveness of the
amendment. Any hearing held would take place while the amendment is in effect. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
A request for a hearing or a petition for leave to intervene must be filed with the Secretary of the Commission, U.S.
Nuclear Regulatory Commission, Washington, DC 20555, Attention: Docketing and Services Branch, or may be delivered
to the Commission's Public Document Room, the Gelman Building, 2120 L Street, NW., Washington, DC 20555, by the above
date. Where petitions are filed during the last 10 days of the notice period, it is requested that the petitioner promptly
so inform the Commission by a toll-free telephone call to Western Union at 1-(800) 248-5100 (in Missouri 1-(800) 342-6700).
The Western Union operator should be given Datagram Identification Number N1023 and the following message addressed
to 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 -->
(Project Director)
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
notice. A copy of the petition should also be sent to the Office of the General Counsel, U.S. Nuclear Regulatory Commission,
Washington, DC 20555, and to the attorney for the licensee. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Nontimely filings of petitions for leave to intervene, amended petitions, supplemental petitions and/or requests
for a hearing will not be entertained absent a determination by the Commission, the presiding officer or the Atomic
Safety and Licensing Board that the petition and/or request should be granted based upon a balancing of the factors
specified in 10 CFR 2.714(a)(1)(i)-(v) and 2.714(d).
