I. Background
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Pursuant to Public Law 97-415, the U.S. Nuclear Regulatory Commission (the Commission or NRC staff) is publishing
this regular biweekly notice. Public Law 97-415 revised section 189 of the Atomic Energy Act of 1954, as amended (the
Act), to require the Commission to publish notice of any amendments issued, or proposed to be issued, under a new provision
of section 189 of the Act. This provision grants the Commission the authority to issue and make immediately effective
any amendment to an operating license upon a determination by the Commission that such amendment involves no significant
hazards consideration, notwithstanding the pendency before the Commission of a request for a hearing from any person.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
This biweekly notice includes all notices of amendments issued, or proposed to be issued from September 30, through
October 14, 1994. The last biweekly notice was published on October 12, 1994 (59 FR 51616).

Notice Of Consideration Of Issuance Of Amendments To Facility Operating Licenses, Proposed No Significant Hazards
Consideration Determination, And Opportunity For A Hearing
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The Commission has made a proposed determination that the following amendment requests involve no significant hazards
consideration. Under the Commission's regulations in 10 CFR 50.92, this means that operation of the facility in accordance
with the proposed amendment would not (1) involve a significant increase in the probability or consequences of an
accident previously evaluated; or (2) create the possibility of a new or different kind of accident from any accident
previously evaluated; or (3) involve a significant reduction in a margin of safety. The basis for this proposed determination
for each amendment request is shown below. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Commission is seeking public comments on this proposed determination. Any comments received within 30 days after
the date of publication of this notice will be considered in making any final determination. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Normally, the Commission will not issue the amendment until the expiration of the 30-day notice period. However,
should circumstances change during the notice period such that failure to act in a timely way would result, for example,
in derating or shutdown of the facility, the Commission may issue the license amendment before the expiration of the
30-day notice period, provided that its final determination is that the amendment involves no significant hazards
consideration. The final determination will consider all public and State comments received before action is taken.
Should the Commission take this action, it will publish in the 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 -->
Federal Register 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
a notice of issuance and provide for opportunity for a hearing after issuance. The Commission expects that the need
to take this action will occur very infrequently. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Written comments may be submitted by mail to the Rules Review and Directives Branch, Division of Freedom of Information
and Publications Services, Office of Administration, U.S. Nuclear Regulatory Commission, Washington, DC 20555,
and should cite the publication date and page number of this 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

notice. Written comments may also be delivered to Room 6D22, Two White Flint North, 11545 Rockville Pike, Rockville,
Maryland from 7:30 a.m. to 4:15 p.m. Federal workdays. Copies of written comments received may be examined at the NRC
Public Document Room, the Gelman Building, 2120 L Street, NW., Washington, DC 20555. The filing of requests for a hearing
and petitions for leave to intervene is discussed below.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
By November 25, 1994, the licensee may file a request for a hearing with respect to issuance of the amendment to the subject
facility operating license and any person whose interest may be affected by this proceeding and who wishes to participate
as a party in the proceeding must file a written request for a hearing and a petition for leave to intervene. Requests
for a hearing and a petition for leave to intervene shall be filed in accordance with the Commission's ``Rules of Practice
for Domestic Licensing Proceedings'' in 10 CFR Part 2. Interested persons should consult a current copy of 10 CFR 2.714
which is available at the Commission's Public Document Room, the Gelman Building, 2120 L Street, NW., Washington,
DC 20555 and at the local public document room for the particular facility involved. If a request for a hearing or petition
for leave to intervene is filed by the above date, the Commission or an Atomic Safety and Licensing Board, designated
by the Commission or by the Chairman of the Atomic Safety and Licensing Board Panel, will rule on the request and/or
petition; and the Secretary or the designated Atomic Safety and Licensing Board will issue a notice of a hearing or
an appropriate order. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
As required by 10 CFR 2.714, a petition for leave to intervene shall set forth with particularity the interest of the
petitioner in the proceeding, and how that interest may be affected by the results of the proceeding. The petition
should specifically explain the reasons why intervention should be permitted with particular reference to the following
factors: (1) the nature of the petitioner's right under the Act to be made a party to the proceeding; (2) the nature and
extent of the petitioner's property, financial, or other interest in the proceeding; and (3) the possible effect
of any order which may be entered in the proceeding on the petitioner's interest. The petition should also identify
the specific aspect(s) of the subject matter of the proceeding as to which petitioner wishes to intervene. Any person
who has filed a petition for leave to intervene or who has been admitted as a party may amend the petition without requesting
leave of the Board up to 15 days prior to the first prehearing conference scheduled in the proceeding, but such an amended
petition must satisfy the specificity requirements described above.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Not later than 15 days prior to the first prehearing conference scheduled in the proceeding, a petitioner shall file
a supplement to the petition to intervene which must include a list of the contentions which are sought to be litigated
in the matter. Each contention must consist of a specific statement of the issue of law or fact to be raised or controverted.
In addition, the petitioner shall provide a brief explanation of the bases of the contention and a concise statement
of the alleged facts or expert opinion which support the contention and on which the petitioner intends to rely in proving
the contention at the hearing. The petitioner must also provide references to those specific sources and documents
of which the petitioner is aware and on which the petitioner intends to rely to establish those facts or expert opinion.
Petitioner must provide sufficient information to show that a genuine dispute exists with the applicant on a material
issue of law or fact. Contentions shall be limited to matters within the scope of the amendment under consideration.
The contention must be one which, if proven, would entitle the petitioner to relief. A petitioner who fails to file
such a supplement which satisfies these requirements with respect to at least one contention will not be permitted
to participate as a party. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Those permitted to intervene become parties to the proceeding, subject to any limitations in the order granting leave
to intervene, and have the opportunity to participate fully in the conduct of the hearing, including the opportunity
to present evidence and cross-examine witnesses. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
If a hearing is requested, the Commission will make a final determination on the issue of no significant hazards consideration.
The final determination will serve to decide when the hearing is held. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
If the final determination is that the amendment request involves no significant hazards consideration, the Commission
may issue the amendment and make it immediately effective, notwithstanding the request for a hearing. Any hearing
held would take place after issuance of the amendment. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
If the final determination is that the amendment request involves a significant hazards consideration, any hearing
held would take place before the issuance of any amendment. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
A request for a hearing or a petition for leave to intervene must be filed with the Secretary of the Commission, U.S.
Nuclear Regulatory Commission, Washington, DC 20555, Attention: Docketing and Services Branch, or may be delivered
to the Commission's Public Document Room, the Gelman Building, 2120 L Street, NW., Washington DC 20555, by the above
date. Where petitions are filed during the last 10 days of the notice period, it is requested that the petitioner promptly
so inform the Commission by a toll-free telephone call to Western Union at 1-(800) 248-5100 (in Missouri 1-(800) 342-6700).
The Western Union operator should be given Datagram Identification Number N1023 and the following message addressed

Description of amendments request: 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The proposed amendments would revise the Unit 2 Shutdown AC Sources Technical Specifications (TSs) to allow a one-time
extension from 7 to 14 days of the allowed outage time (AOT) for the dedicated Class 1E emergency power source during
the upcoming Unit 2 1995 Refueling Outage (RFO-10). The proposed amendments would also revise the Unit 1 Control Room
Emergency Ventilation System (CREVS) TSs to provide a one-time extension from 7 to 30 days of the AOT for one train of
the CREVS to be inoperable. As noted, these extensions will be needed during the upcoming 1995 Unit 2 RFO-10 to support
the modifications scheduled for the onsite electrical distribution system in response to the Station Blackout (SBO)
Rule, 10 CFR 50.63, and the upgrade of No. 21 Emergency Diesel Generator (EDG).
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The specific changes requested are: 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Unit 2 TSs 3.8.1.2 and 3.8.2.2 will include a footnote indicating that the AOT for aligning an operable emergency diesel
generator (EDG) to provide power to the emergency busses within 14 days during the Unit 2 RFO-10.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Unit 1 TS 3.7.6.1 will be modified to indicate that during the No. 21 EDG upgrade, the time to restore the No. 21 filter
train of the air conditioning unit to operable status may be extended to 30 days (for loss of emergency power only) if:
1) A temporary diesel generator is demonstrated to be available by starting it at least once per 7 days and 2) if action
1 is not met, restore compliance with the action within 7 days or be at least in hot standby within the next 6 hours and
in cold shutdown within the following 30 hours.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Basis for proposed no significant hazards consideration determination: 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
As required by 10 CFR 50.91(a), the licensee has provided its analysis of issue of no significant hazards consideration
for each of the proposed changes, which is presented below:
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->
In relation to the requested changes to the Unit 2 TSs: 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
1. Would not involve a significant increase in the probability or consequences of an accident previously evaluated.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Requiring one Class 1E Emergency Diesel Generator (EDG) to be available for a shutdown unit ensures that AC power will
be available for a loss of offsite power event, a boron dilution event, or a fuel handling incident. There is a very low
probability that a loss of offsite power will occur due to severe weather or inadvertent damage to the switchyard during
the 14-day period that the temporary splice box is being installed and No. 12 EDG is out-of-service. The Calvert Cliffs
offsite power supply is highly redundant and has significant capability in withstanding severe weather events,
such as tornadoes. In addition, Calvert Cliffs Emergency Response Plan Implementation Procedures requires that
certain actions be taken, up to and including shutdown of both units, on the approach of a severe storm, such as a hurricane.
The probability of a loss of offsite power is maintained low by prohibiting planned maintenance on two of the three
500 kV transmission lines and associated relaying and devices within the switchyard. Availability of the required
offsite power sources will be verified once per shift. In addition to the offsite power sources, a temporary diesel
generator will also be installed to provide a backup onsite power source with the capacity to support the safety-related
loads of the shutdown unit.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The boron dilution event and the fuel handling incident are the only two accidents that are explicitly analyzed in
the Updated Final Safety Analysis Report for a shutdown unit. The potential accident precursors such as core alterations,
positive reactivity insertions, movement of irradiated fuel and movement of heavy loads over irradiated fuel, will
be prohibited while No. 12 EDG is out-of-service for the temporary splice box installation. Therefore the probability
of a boron dilution event or fuel handling incident is decreased during the operations allowed by this change. The
requirement to maintain containment penetration closure ensures that the consequences of an accident would not
be significantly increased.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Therefore, the proposed change does not involve a significant increase in the probability or consequences of an accident
previously evaluated.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
2. Would not create the possibility of a new or different type of accident from any accident previously evaluated.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
A temporary diesel generator is being installed onto a 4 kV bus of the shutdown unit while the dedicated EDG for this
unit is transferred to the operating unit for up to 14 days. This is an extension of the same configuration allowed by
Action Statements 3.8.1.2.b and 3.8.2.2.b with additional provision taken for the Control Room Emergency Ventilation
System (CREVS). The EDGs will be aligned so that each train of the CREVS will have an emergency power supply available.
The proposed change has been evaluated and it has been determined that it does not impair any existing safety-related
equipment needed to maintain the unit in a safe shutdown condition, and does not create any new accident initiators.
The operation of the temporary diesel generator is familiar to the operators and is not significantly different from
typical operator activities.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Therefore, the proposed change does not create the possibility of a new or different type of accident from any accident
previously evaluated.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
3. Would not involve a significant reduction in a margin of safety.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The safety function provided by the AC electrical power sources and associated distribution systems for a shutdown
unit is to ensure that the unit can be maintained in a safe shutdown condition, and there is sufficient instrumentation
and control capability available for monitoring and maintaining the unit status. The proposed change would allow
the shutdown unit to be without a dedicated Class 1E emergency power source for up to 14 days. This is an extension of
the outage time of seven days allowed by the Technical Specifications for performing maintenance and inspections
on No. 12 EDG. This proposed change will have no impact on the offsite power sources.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Several compensatory measures will be taken during this period to ensure that a power source will be available for
the shutdown unit. These measures include requiring that two offsite power sources are available, and a temporary
diesel generator will be installed capable of supplying the loads necessary to maintain the unit in a safe condition.
In addition, Technical Specifications require several compensatory measures to reduce the potential for a fuel
handling incident and a boron dilution event. These measures include prohibiting positive reactivity changes,
suspending core alterations, movement of irradiated fuel, and the movement of heavy loads over irradiated fuel.
Establishing containment penetration closure further ensures that adequate margin of safety is maintained. In
addition, reduced inventory conditions of the Reactor Coolant System will be prohibited during the 14-day period.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Therefore, the proposed change does not involve a significant reduction in a margin of safety.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In relation to the requested changes in the Unit 1 TSs:
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
1. Would not involve a significant increase in the probability or consequences of an accident previously evaluated.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Control Room Emergency Ventilation System (CREVS) is designed so that the Control Room can be occupied under all
plant conditions. The CREVS is required to maintain the Control Room temperature and to filter the Control Room air
in the event of a radioactive release. When No. 21 Emergency Diesel Generator (EDG) is being upgraded, No. 12 CREVS
will be without a Class 1E emergency power source. The CREVS is not an initiator in any previously evaluated accidents.
Therefore, the proposed change does not involve an increase in the probability of an accident previously evaluated.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The CREVS is required to maintain the Control Room habitable following a radioactive release from a loss of coolant
accident, a main steam break, or a steam generator tube rupture. There is a very low probability of an event occurring
requiring Control Room isolation during the 30-day period that it will take to upgrade No. 21 EDG. Requiring that the
CREVS have both a normal power source and an emergency power source available ensures that one train of the system will
be available so that the Control Room can be occupied under these conditions. The probability of a loss of offsite power
is very low due to the highly redundant design of the offsite power supply. Planned maintenance on three of the offsite
power supplies and associated relaying and devices within the switchyard will be prohibited during the upgrade period
to maintain the low probability of a loss of offsite power event. Number 12 CREVS train will continue to have its normal
power source for all but approximately four days when the bus will be de-energized to allow bus work that is necessary
to the tie-in of the Alternate AC diesel generator. Number 11 CREVS will have both its normal and emergency power supply
available and this train is capable of maintaining the Control Room habitable. In addition, a temporary diesel generator
will be installed to provide assurance that an emergency power source will be available to No. 12 CREVS. The compensatory
measures that will be taken during this period will ensure that the proposed change does not involve a significant
increase in the consequences of an accident previously evaluated.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Therefore, the proposed change does not involve a significant increase in the probability or consequences of an accident
previously evaluated.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
2. Would not create the possibility of a new or different type of accident from any accident previously evaluated.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The CREVS is not being modified by this proposed change. The system will continue to operate in the same manner. Number
21 EDG will operate in a similar manner after the upgrade and will be able to support unit operation after all the testing
is completed. The installation of the temporary diesel generator during the upgrade period has been evaluated to
ensure that it does not create any new accident initiators. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Therefore, the proposed change does not create the possibility of a new or different type of accident from any accident
previously evaluated.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
3. Would not involve a significant reduction in a margin of safety.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The operability of the CREVS during Modes 1 through 4 ensures that the Control Room will remain habitable under all
plant conditions. The proposed change does not affect the function of the CREVS. The proposed change will allow one
train of the CREVS to be without a Class 1E emergency power supply for up to 30 days. This train will have the normal power
supply available for all but approximately four days to allow necessary bus work. The other train of the CREVS will
have both its normal and emergency power supplies during this period. Compensatory measures that will be taken include
prohibiting planned maintenance on the required offsite power sources and installing a temporary diesel generator
of sufficient capacity as a backup to the affected train. These measures will maintain the current margin of safety.
The upgrade to the existing EDGs will provide additional margin for the electrical loading of 4 kV safety-related
busses. The completion of the No. 21 EDG upgrade will improve the margin of safety for the onsite electrical distribution
system.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Therefore, the proposed change does not involve a significant reduction in a margin of safety.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The proposed amendment changes the Pilgrim Nuclear Power Station Technical Specifications Sections 3.7.B.1.a,
3.7.B.1.c, 3.7.B.1.e, 3.7.B.2.a, and 3.7.B.2.c. The proposed changes also add new sections 3.7.B.1.f and 3.7.B.2.e.
These sections require both trains of the Standby Gas Treatment (SGTS) and Control Room High Efficiency Air Filtration
(CRHEAF) System to be operable for the initiation of fuel movement and during fuel handling operations involving
irradiated fuel.

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Basis for proposed no significant hazards consideration determination: 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
As required by 10 CFR 50.91(a), the licensee has provided its analysis of the issue of no significant hazards consideration,
which is presented below:
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->
1. The operation of Pilgrim Station in accordance with the proposed amendment will not involve a significant increase
in the probability or consequences of an accident previously evaluated.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Technical Specifications 3.7.B.1 and 3.7.B.2.e restrict the movement of irradiated fuel when only one train of SGTS
or one train of CRHEAF are operable. Irradiated fuel movement may not begin and may only continue for seven days when
the Limiting Condition of Operation is entered.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Removing these restrictions during refueling operations does not involve a significant increase in the probability
or consequences of an accident previously evaluated because compensatory measures will be in place.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
When sections 3.7.B.1.f and 3.7.B.2.e are invoked fuel movement will not commence until 5 days following plant shutdown
and reactor vessel will be flooded-up to elevation 114''. The 5 day period provides decay-time before irradiated
fuel movement begins. Flooding-up elevation 114'' provides an enlarged inventory reducing the possibility of a
loss-of-coolant event exposing fuel such that radioactive gasses are produced, an event SGTS and CRHEAF are designed
to mitigate.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Other compensatory measures include requiring the SBO [station blackout] diesel or the shutdown transformer to
be operable prior to and during the fuel movement. This adds defense-in-depth by making available another power supply
to the in-service safety-related bus. Also, the substitution of a non-safety power supply to the SGTS and CRHEAF ``inoperable''
systems while their safety-grade bus is out-of-service for maintenance will provide offsite power to the ``inoperable''
train. While this electrical supply is not safety-grade, it is reliable and capable of powering the SGTS and CRHEAF
systems. The components of the ``inoperable'' trains will be available with power from an alternate power source.
The compensatory connection to the non-safety grade bus gives added confidence these trains can perform the design
function although they are not ``operable'' as defined by Technical Specifications.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Operating Pilgrim in accordance with this proposed change does not involve a significant increase in the probability
or consequence of an accident previously analyzed because compensatory measures will be in force to: restrict the
commencement of irradiated fuel handling or new fuel handling over the spent fuel or core until 5 days following reactor
shutdown; provide a reliable source of power to the ``inoperable'' SGTS and CRHEAF systems; provide an enlarged coolant
inventory to protect irradiated fuel from the effects of an inadvertent draindown of the vessel; and provide an additional
source of emergency power to the active SGTS and CRHEAF systems by ensuring the operability of the SBO diesel generator
or the Shutdown Transformer.

2. The operation of Pilgrim Station in accordance with the proposed amendment will not create the possibility of a
new or different kind of accident from any accident previously evaluated.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Planned maintenance activities require removing a safety-related bus and emergency diesel generator powering
a train of SGTS and CRHEAF from service. The redundant trains are not affected. The affected trains of SGTS and CRHEAF
will be connected to a non-safety bus, allowing them to operate but not allowing them to be considered operable under
the purview of Technical Specifications. The proposed change allows refueling activities to commence with one train
of SGTS and CRHEAF fully operable and the other train available but not powered by its safety grade bus and associated
emergency diesel generator. Compensatory measures will be in effect during refueling activities involving this
configuration. The proposed changes do not create the possibility of a new or different kind of accident from the fuel-drop
accident previously analyzed. Therefore, operating Pilgrim in accordance with this change will not create the possibility
of a new or different kind of accident from any accident previously analyzed.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
3. The operation of Pilgrim Station in accordance with the proposed amendment will not involve a significant reduction
in the margin of safety.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
SGTS and CRHEAF contribute to the margin of safety during fuel handling by mitigating the consequences of a fuel-handling
event. Allowing an exception to the requirement of both trains of SGTS and CRHEAF operable prior to or during fuel movement
activities does not involve a significant reduction in the margin of safety because the first line of defense, the
other SGTS and CRHEAF trains, will be operable. The redundant trains will also be powered and operable in all ways except
the ``operable'' concept required by Technical Specification.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Hence, the actual condition of the equipment allows it to meet its design function except under the strict Technical
Specification interpretation of operable, and the described compensatory measures that will be in effect when the
exception is employed, constrain the potential impact on the margin of safety caused by using the exception; therefore,
operating Pilgrim in accordance with this proposed Technical Specification request does not involve a significant
reduction in the margin of safety.

The proposed amendment would reduce the Reactor Pressure Setpoint at which the shutdown cooling system automatically

which is presented below:
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->
1. The operation of Pilgrim Station in accordance with the proposed amendment will not involve a significant increase
in the probability or consequences of an accident previously evaluated.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Technical Specification Table 3.2.A lists the instrumentation that initiates primary containment isolation and
also lists the trip level setting (setpoints) for that instrumentation. The setpoint for reactor high pressure is
presently [less than or equal to] 110 psig which was selected to provide protection for the RHR [residual heat removal]
low pressure suction piping against possible overpressurization. This signal initiates a group 3 containment isolation
by closing the shutdown cooling isolation valves and the Low Pressure Coolant Injection (LPCI) valves. To provide
an optimal solution to address Generic Letter 89-10, the motor-operated valves which effect the isolation of the
RHR suction piping (MO1001-47 and MO1001-50) are being modified based on a lower differential pressure in the design
calculations. The setpoint is being reduced to ensure plant operation is maintained in accordance with the new design
and to continue to provide the protection necessary against overpressurization. This does not involve an increase
in the probability or consequences of an accident previously analyzed because reducing the setpoint to less than
what the technical specifications currently requires is a change in the conservative direction relative to protection
of the piping. The LPCI injection valves are designed for higher pressures and the proposed setpoint change does not
involve an increase in the probability or consequences of an accident previously evaluated.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Technical Specification Table 3.2.B lists instrumentation that initiates or controls the core and containment
cooling systems and also lists the trip level settings (setpoints) for that instrumentation. The setpoint for reactor
low pressure [less than or equal to] 110 psig, is a permissive for the group 3 isolation of the RHR inboard injection
valves. Reducing the setpoint to [less than or equal to] 76 psig is consistent with the design of the other group 3 isolation
valves that receive the same signal and accomplishes the isolation of the shutdown cooling system when there is a system
breach. Thus, revising this setpoint does not increase the probability or consequences of an accident previously
evaluated.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
2. The operation of Pilgrim Station in accordance with the proposed amendment will not create the possibility of a
new or different kind of accident from any accident previously evaluated.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The proposed setpoint change supports modifications made to the shutdown cooling isolation valves to provide additional
margin to address Generic Letter 89-10 concerns. Reducing the setpoint for this function continues to provide protection
of the RHR suction piping and ensures closure of the isolation valves. Therefore, revising the reactor high pressure
setpoint to [less than or equal to] 76 psig for instrumentation that initiates primary containment isolation (Table
3.2.A) does not create the possibility of a new or different kind of accident previously evaluated. Similarly, the
revision of the reactor low pressure setpoint to [less than or equal to] 76 psig for instrumentation that initiates
or controls the core and containment cooling systems does not create the possibility of a new or different kind of accident
from any accident previously evaluated.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
3. The operation of Pilgrim Station in accordance with the proposed amendment will not involve a significant reduction
in a margin of safety. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The purpose of the setpoint for reactor pressure in Table 3.2.A and 3.2.B is to provide protection for the RHR suction
piping and ensure proper isolation for unlikely piping breaches. Changing the setpoint to a lower value is consistent
with modifications being made to the shutdown cooling isolation valves. The margin of safety for this setpoint was
established to protect the RHR suction piping from overpressurization and to ensure that primary containment integrity
could be established by the isolation valves on a Group 3 isolation. A margin of safety for protecting the RHR suction
piping exists due to the difference between the design pressure of the piping and the setpoint specified in the technical
specifications. Reducing the setpoint increases the difference between the design pressure of the piping and the
setpoint hence, this margin of safety is increased. The margin of safety established for primary containment isolation
valves is maintained by specifying a setpoint which corresponds to the closing differential pressure of the valves
under postulated accident conditions. The setpoint change does not reduce the design margins established to ensure
the valves perform their design isolation function when required. The low pressure coolant injection valves that
receive this same signal are designed for higher pressures than the current setpoint of [less than or equal to] 110
psig and, therefore, a lower setpoint increases the margin of safety. Thus, the proposed amendment does not involve
a significant reduction in a margin of safety.

which is presented below:
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->
1. The Operation of Pilgrim Station in accordance with the proposed amendment will not involve a significant increase
in the probability or consequences of an accident previously evaluated. [***].
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The discharge piping for ECC systems is maintained filled to prevent water hammer during automatic pump starts. Monthly
venting is the primary means of ensuring filled discharge piping. The pressure switches are an adjunct to such venting.
Hence, piping in the Core Spray System, the Low Pressure Coolant Injection System (LPCI), the High Pressure Coolant
Injection (HPCI) system, and the Reactor Core Isolation Coolant (RCIC) system are all equipped with pressure switches
that detect pressure decay in the discharge piping of these systems.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
This proposed change does not change Pilgrim's configuration or equipment. The switches perform a surveillance
function and do not provide a signal needed to prevent or mitigate an accident. The switches will continue to perform
their surveillance function and their surveillance and calibration will be performed in accordance with Pilgrim
procedures. Removal of section 4.5.H.4 eliminates the possibility of inoperable switches forcing the shutdown
of Pilgrim or the alternative of declaring an operable safety system inoperable because of its association with these
switches.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Technical Specifications will continue to require venting the discharge piping high point when the systems are configured
such that water hammer can occur. (sections 4.5.H.1, 4.5.H.2 and 4.5.H.3). Thus, the application of this proposed
change does not reduce the Technical Specifications intent of reducing the likelihood of discharge piping water
hammer. Therefore, operating Pilgrim Station in accordance with the proposed amendment will not involve a significant
increase in the probability or consequences of an accident previously analyzed.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
2. The operation of Pilgrim Station in accordance with the proposed amendment will not create the possibility of a
new or different kind of accident from any accident previously evaluated.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Section 4.5.H's purpose is to maintain the ECCS discharge piping filled to prevent water hammer. The purpose of the
pressure switches is to detect voids in ECCS discharge piping to prevent the possibility of damage due to water hammer.
These switches are not safety-related, have no automatic functions, and are not relied on to prevent or mitigate an
accident. Instead, they enhance the existing discharge pipe venting surveillance requirements by detecting void
formation in discharge pipe.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The switches will continue to perform their surveillance function through Pilgrim procedures. Venting will continue
to be required by Technical Specifications. Therefore, operating Pilgrim in accordance with this proposed change
does not create the possibility of a new or different kind of accident from any accident previously evaluated because
the proposed change does not impair the detection of conditions necessary to produce a water hammer in the discharge
piping.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
3. The operation of Pilgrim Station in accordance with the proposed amendment will not involve a significant reduction
in a margin of safety.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The discharge piping pressure switches are surveillance instruments and act as a secondary means of protecting the
discharge piping from conditions that can produce water hammer. They are not relied on to prevent or mitigate accidents.
Hence, these switches do not significantly impact safety because they are not the primary means of preventing discharge
piping water hammer. Therefore, removing the pressure switches from Technical Specifications potentially contributes
to plant availability but does not involve a significant reduction in a margin of safety because the primary method
of detection (venting) remains and the switches will continue to be subject to procedural controls. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
As required by 10 CFR 50.91(a), the licensee has provided its analysis of the issue of no significant hazards consideration,
which is presented below:
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->
1. The proposed change does not involve a significant increase in the probability or consequences of an accident previously
evaluated. The proposed change involves replacement of concentrated NaOH injected via the containment spray system
with trisodium phosphate (TSP) stored in the containment and dissolved in the sump recirculation solution to maintain
acceptable post accident spray/recirculation solution chemistry. Deletion of the concentrated NaOH will eliminate
a personnel hazard. The pH control system functions in response to an accident and does not involve or have any effect
on any initiating event for any accident previously evaluated. Operation under the proposed amendment will continue
to ensure that iodine potentially released post-LOCA is retained in the sump solution, and resultant offsite and
control room thyroid doses are within the limits of 10 CFR 100 and 10 CFR 50, Appendix A, General Design Criterion 19,
respectively.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
2. The proposed change does not create the possibility of a new or different kind of accident from any accident previously
evaluated. The deleted equipment is isolated from the remaining equipment by blind flanges, locked closed valves,
cut and capped piping, determinated and/or spared cables; and interfaces are analyzed to ensure the remaining required
equipment meets applicable original design requirements. The new equipment (TSP and baskets) is a passive pH control
system and is supported and analyzed to ensure there are no adverse interfaces (e.g. pipe break, jet impingement,
seismic) with existing equipment, systems, or structures. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
3. The proposed change does not involve a significant reduction in a margin of safety. The slight change in recirculation
solution pH maintains adequate protection against chloride induced stress corrosion cracking of austenitic stainless
steel and maintains the capability of the solution to retain iodine. It results in an insignificant increase in the
post-accident rate of hydrogen generation, which remains well within the existing capacity of the hydrogen recombiners.
The increased mass in the containment will have no significant impact on post-accident flood levels, recirculation
solution boron concentration, or peak clad temperatures. No other operating parameters for systems, structures,
or components assumed to operate in the safety analysis are changed. The offsite and control room doses meet the limits
of 10 CFR 100 and GDC 19 respectively. Because the trisodium phosphate is nonvolatile and the baskets are protected
with solid covers and are located slightly above the floor in the containment where access is strictly controlled,
a surveillance interval of once per refueling outage provides assurance that the TSP will be available when required.

The proposed amendment would revise the Cooper Nuclear Station (CNS) Technical Specifications, Section 3.5.C ``HPCI

Evaluation
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The change in the reactor vessel pressure at which the High Pressure Coolant Injection (HPCI) System must be operable
from 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
113 psig to 150 psig will not result in a significant increase in the probability or consequences of an accident previously
evaluated. The HPCI System is designed to provide adequate reactor vessel coolant injection for small break accidents
where the reactor vessel remains pressurized. Therefore, the HPCI System provides a means of responding to previously
analyzed accidents. Changing the lower bound reactor vessel pressure limit at which the HPCI System must be operable
does not affect any of the accident initiation sequences previously analyzed, and therefore this proposed change
will not result in an increase in the probability of any accident previously analyzed.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The change in the required pressure at which the HPCI System must be operable from 113 psig to 150 psig will not involve
a significant increase in the consequences of any accident previously evaluated. Increasing this minimum pressure
at which the HPCI System must be OPERABLE will not affect the availability of other systems which provide standby core
cooling. The CNS Core Standby Cooling Systems (CSCS), which consist of the HPCI System, the Automatic Depressurization
System (ADS), the Low Pressure Coolant Injection (LPCI) System, and the Core Spray (CS) System, are designed to cover
the spectrum of loss-of-coolant accidents. For large break events, the reactor vessel will depressurize below the
point where the HPCI System is OPERABLE, and single failure proof core cooling is provided by a combination of the LPCI
and CS systems. For small break events wherein the reactor vessel does not rapidly depressurize, the HPCI System is
designed to provide core cooling with a reactor vessel pressure range of 1120 psig to 150 psig. Upon failure of the HPCI
System to provide adequate core cooling, the ADS in conjunction with the LPCI and CS systems provide single failure
proof assurance of adequate core cooling. The Low Pressure Systems (LPCI and CS) are designed and required to provide
core cooling at reactor pressures below 150 psig.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The District performed calculations which have determined that the low pressure Core Standby Cooling systems are
capable of providing adequate core cooling with a reactor pressure of 150 psig under the most degraded pump conditions,
i.e., pump performance at minimum Technical Specifications requirements. Additionally, the District reviewed
applicable engineering calculations to ensure that no calculations were relying on the HPCI System to provide degraded
flow to the reactor vessel during any accident scenario or transient. Based on the diverse means of providing adequate
core cooling for the spectrum of loss-of-coolant accidents, and the capability of the low pressure core cooling systems
to provide adequate core cooling at 150 psig and below, changing the required pressure at which HPCI must be operable
from 113 psig to 150 psig will not change the capability to provide adequate core cooling following postulated events.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The proposed changes do not alter the conditions or assumptions in any of the Updated Safety Analysis Report (USAR)
accident analyses. Since the USAR accident analyses remain bounding, the radiological consequences previously
evaluated are not adversely affected by the proposed changes. Therefore, it can be concluded
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
that the proposed changes do not involve a significant increase in the probability or consequences of an accident
previously evaluated.

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=3 -->
Evaluation
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The proposed changes introduce no new failure modes for any plant system or component important to safety nor has any
new limiting failure been identified as a result of the proposed changes. Increasing the minimum reactor pressure
at which the HPCI System is required to be OPERABLE will not cause an unplanned initiation of the HPCI System or any other
plant system or equipment, nor will the change impede the initiation of any required safety system. The HPCI System
relies on the containment suppression pool, emergency condensate storage tanks, plant D.C. electrical system,
and the reactor low water level and high drywell pressure instrumentation to adequately operate. The proposed increase
in the minimum reactor pressure at which the HPCI System would be required OPERABLE will not affect the equipment of
these systems, nor will the change affect the physical configuration of the HPCI System. There will be no change in
the types or increase in the amount of effluents released offsite. Therefore, the proposed change does not create
the possibility of a new or different kind of accident from any accident previously evaluated.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=3 -->
Evaluation
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Changing the reactor vessel pressure at which the HPCI System must be OPERABLE from 113 psig to 150 psig will not constitute
a significant reduction in the margin of safety. As stated in the Technical Specifications Bases Section 3.5.C, the
HPCI System is designed to provide rated cooling water flow for reactor pressures ranging from 1120 psig to 150 psig.
The HPCI is not designed to provide rated cooling water flow at reactor pressures below 150 psig. At reactor operating
pressures below 150 psig, the low pressure core cooling systems are required to be available, are capable of fulfilling
their functions, and provide the required flow in the low pressure regions below 150 psig. Additionally, the combination
of the ADS, LPCI and CS systems provide additional means of providing adequate core cooling at any reactor pressure.
Therefore the proposed change to increase the minimum reactor pressure at which the HPCI System is required to be operable
to greater than 150 psig will not significantly reduce the margin of safety.

Basis for proposed no significant hazards consideration determination: 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
As required by 10 CFR 50.91(a), the licensee has provided its analysis of the issue of no significant hazards consideration,
which is presented below:
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->
NNECO has reviewed the proposed changes in accordance with 10CFR50.92 and concludes that the changes do not involve
a significant hazards consideration (SHC). The basis for this conclusion is that the three criteria of 10CFR50.92(c)
are not compromised. The proposed changes do not involve an SHC because the changes would not:
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
1. Involve a significant increase in the probability or consequences of an accident previously analyzed.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The proposed changes do not affect the operation of the APR [automatic pressure relief] or FWCI [feedwater coolant
injection] subsystems, nor the SBGT [standby gas treatment] system. The proposed changes do not modify the required
actions described in the LCOs [limiting conditions for operation] when either one or both circuits of SBGT or an APR
valve are determined to be inoperable. The proposed changes will increase the availability of the APR subsystem by
eliminating a surveillance requirement that causes the actuation logic to be taken out of service for testing when
one valve is determined to be inoperable. The proposed changes will not affect the availability of the remaining circuit
of SBGT since testing does not remove the train from service.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Both the SBGT and APR systems function to mitigate the consequences of postulated accidents. As such, modification
to the surveillance requirements does not create a significant increase in the probability of an accident. Eliminating
the alternate train testing requirement will not significantly increase the consequences of a postulated accident.
The added assurance that the APR actuation logic is operable which is provided by Section 4.5.D.2 is not sufficient
to justify the loss of safety function during testing, or the increased risk of inadvertent operation of the APR valves
or the FWCI subsystem. While Technical Specification 4.7.B.3.c does not remove the remaining SBGT circuit from service,
reasonable assurance of operability is provided by Technical Specification 4.7.B.2.d which requires a monthly
demonstration of operability of each train of the SBGT system.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Therefore, no significant increase in the probability or consequences of an accident previously analyzed would
occur.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
2. Create the possibility of a new or different kind of accident from any previously analyzed.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The proposed changes delete the requirement to demonstrate the operability of the remaining APR valves actuation
logic, the FWCI subsystem, and the alternate circuit of SBGT immediately and daily thereafter when one APR valve or
one circuit of SBGT is determined to be inoperable. The proposed changes do not add or change any equipment or logic.
The proposed changes also do not alter any system operability requirements. These changes only affect the number
of surveillance tests which must be performed. They do not affect the test methodology for any of these systems.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Since there are no changes to the function, operation, or surveillance test methodology of any of these systems, the
possibility of a new or different kind of accident is not created.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
3. Involve a significant reduction in the margin of safety.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The proposed changes delete the requirement to demonstrate the operability of the remaining APR valves actuation
logic, the FWCI subsystem, and the alternate circuit of SBGT immediately and
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
daily thereafter when one APR valve or one circuit of SBGT is determined to be inoperable. The elimination of the additional
assurance that the actuation logic for the remaining APR valves and the FWCI subsystem is operable is more than offset
by the increase in the margin of safety which is created by eliminating a requirement to remove the safety system from
service for testing. The margin of safety for the SBGT system is not significantly reduced since this system is tested
monthly in accordance with Technical Specification 4.7.B.2.d.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Assurance of operability is provided by the normal, scheduled surveillances which have been established at a sufficient
interval to provide reasonable assurance of operability. Therefore, the proposed changes do not involve a significant
reduction in the margin of safety.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Description of amendment requests: 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The proposed amendments would revise the combined Technical Specifications (TS) for the Diablo Canyon Power Plant
Unit Nos. 1 and 2 to revise surveillance requirements (SRs) as recommended by NRC Generic Letter (GL) 93-05, ``Line-Item
Technical Specification Improvements to Reduce Surveillance Requirements for Testing During Power Operation.''
The specific TS changes proposed are as follows:
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(1) TS SR 4.1.3.1.2 would be revised to change the frequency for testing the movability of the control rods from at least
once per 31 days to at least once per 92 days.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(2) TS 3/4.3.2, Table 4.3-2, ``Engineered Safety Features Actuation System Instrumentation Surveillance Requirements,''
Functional Unit 3.c.4), and TS 3/4.3.3.1, Table 4.3-3, ``Radiation Monitoring Instrumentation for Plant Operations
SRs,'' would be revised to change the monthly channel functional test to a quarterly channel functional test.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(3) The proposed changes to TS 3/4.5.1 are as follows: (a)TS SR 4.5.1.1a.1) would be revised to more clearly state that
the accumulator water volume and pressure must be verified to be within their limits. (b) TS SR 4.5.1.1b. would be revised
to specify that the boron concentration surveillance is not required to be performed if the accumulator makeup source
was the refueling water storage tank (RWST). (c) TS SR 4.5.1.2 would be relocated to plant procedures.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(4) TS SR 4.5.2c.2) would be revised to clarify that a separate containment entry to verify the absence of loose debris
is not required after each containment entry.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(5) TS SR 4.6.2.1d. would be revised to change the frequency for a containment spray header flow test from at least once
per 5 years to at least once per 10 years.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(6) TS SR 4.6.4.2a. would be revised to change the verification of the minimum hydrogen recombiner sheath temperature
from at least once per 6 months to at least once each refueling interval. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(7) TS SR 4.7.1.2.1 would be revised to change the surveillance frequency for testing each auxiliary feedwater (AFW)
pump from at least once per 31 days to at least once per 92 days on a staggered test basis. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(8) TS SR 4.10.1.2 would be revised to lengthen the allowed period of time for a rod drop test from 24 hours to 7 days prior
to reducing shutdown margin to less than the limits of TS 3.1.1.1.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(9) TS SR 4.11.2.6 would be revised to change the surveillance frequency from 24 hours to 7 days when radioactive material
is being added to the gas decay tanks and to add a requirement to monitor radioactive material concentrations in the
gas decay tanks at least once per 24 hours when system degassing operations are in progress.

As required by 10 CFR 50.91(a), the licensee has provided its analysis of the issue of no significant hazards consideration,
which is presented below:
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->
a. Does the change involve a significant increase in the probability or consequences of an accident previously evaluated?
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The changes proposed in this LAR [license amendment request] are consistent with the guidance provided in GL 93-05.
The proposed changes eliminate testing that is likely to cause transients or excessive wear of equipment. An evaluation
of these changes indicates that they result in a net benefit to plant safety. The evaluation considered: 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(i) Unavailability of safety equipment due to testing
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(ii) Initiation of significant transients due to testing
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(iii) Actuation of engineered safety features that unnecessarily cycle safety equipment
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(iv) Importance to safety of that system or component
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(v) Failure rate of that system or component
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(vi) Effectiveness of the test in discovering the failure
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
As a result of the decrease in the testing frequencies, the risk of testing causing a transient and equipment degradation
will be decreased, and the reliability of the equipment will not be significantly decreased.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Therefore, the proposed changes do not involve a significant increase in the probability or consequences of an accident
previously evaluated.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
b. Does the change create the possibility of a new or different kind of accident from any accident previously evaluated?
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The proposed changes do not affect the method of operating any equipment at DCPP. Additionally, the proposed changes
do not result in a physical modification to any plant equipment.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Therefore, the proposed changes do not create the possibility of a new or different kind of accident from any accident
previously evaluated. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
c. Does the change involve a significant reduction in a margin of safety?
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The proposed changes affect the surveillance requirements. There is no decrease in equipment reliability by the
elimination of unnecessary testing that increases the risk of transients or equipment degradation. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Therefore, the proposed changes do not involve a significant reduction in a margin of safety.

Description of amendment request: 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The proposed license amendment would revise Technical Specification (TS) 3/4.7.4, ``Snubbers,'' and its bases,
in accordance with NRC Generic Letter (GL) 90-09, ``Alternative Requirements for Snubber Visual Inspection Intervals
and Corrective Actions.'' One difference from GL 90-09 is that the initial inspection interval using the new criteria
would be 18 months from the conclusion of the visual inspection conducted during the recently completed refueling
outage. Additional changes to the TS would be made to ensure consistency with the revised snubber visual inspection
interval schedule.

Basis for proposed no significant hazards consideration determination: 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
As required by 10 CFR 50.91(a), the licensee has provided its analysis of the issue of no significant hazards consideration,
which is presented below:
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->
The proposed change has been reviewed for PNPP and has been determined not to involve a significant hazards consideration
based on the following:
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
1. The proposed change does not involve a significant increase in the probability or consequences of an accident previously
evaluated.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Implementing the guidance recommended in a GL 90-09 will not introduce any new failure mode and will not alter any assumptions
previously made in evaluating the consequences of an accident. As stated in the GL, the proposed alternate schedule
for visual inspections of snubbers will maintain the same operability confidence level as the existing schedule.
Also, the surveillance requirements and schedule for snubbers functional testing remains the same, providing a
95 percent confidence level that 90 percent to 100 percent of the snubbers operate within the specified acceptance
limits. The proposed visual inspection schedule is separate from the functional testing and provides additional
confidence that the installed snubbers will serve their design function and are being maintained operable. The proposed
change does not affect limiting safety system settings or operating parameters, and does not modify or add any accident
initiating events or parameters. No hardware modifications are associated with these changes. Therefore, the proposed
change does not significantly increase the probability or consequences of an accident previously evaluated.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
2. The proposed change does not create the possibility of a new or different kind of accident from any accident previously
evaluated.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Implementing the recommendations provided in GL 90-09 does not involve any physical alterations to plant equipment,
changes to setpoints or operating parameters, nor does it involve any accident initiating event. As stated in the
GL, the alternate schedule for snubber visual inspections maintains the same confidence level as the existing schedule.
In addition to the visual inspections, functional testing of snubbers, which provides a 95 percent confidence level
that 90 percent to 100 percent of the snubbers operate within specified acceptance limits, will continue to be performed.
Since this TS change does not physically alter the plant equipment and the snubber confidence level remains the same
there will not be any new or different accident resulting from snubber failure from any accident previously evaluated.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
3. The proposed change does not involve a significant reduction in a margin of safety.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The proposed change incorporates surveillance requirements for snubber visual inspection intervals that are consistent
with the guidance provided in GL 90-09. As stated in the GL, the proposed snubber visual inspection interval maintains
the same confidence level as the existing snubber visual inspection interval. This surveillance requirement does
not alter the current Limiting Condition for Operation or the accompanying actions for the snubber(s). The requirement
for functional testing of safety-related snubbers is unchanged and remains the basis for the established margin
of safety and assures a 95 percent confidence level that 90 percent to 100 percent of the snubbers operate within the
specified acceptance limits. The functional testing along with the proposed visual inspection provides adequate
assurance that the snubber will perform its intended function. Therefore, the proposed change does not involve a
significant reduction in a margin of safety.

CRITERION 1 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Operation of this facility under the proposed Technical Specifications change will not create a significant increase
in the probability or consequences of an accident previously evaluated. The proposed changes to the allowed out of
service times have no impact on the probability of an accident occurring. This equipment being out of service is not
an initiator for any accident previously evaluated. There is no physical change to the facility, its systems or its
operation. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The clarification of service water pump operability requirements will ensure redundant train capability to mitigate
the consequences of an accident which has been previously evaluated. Extending the allowed out of service times for
the safety injection, residual heat removal, and containment spray pumps and valves and residual heat removal heat
exchangers does not create a significant increase in the consequences of an accident previously evaluated. The proposed
changes are consistent with the Westinghouse Improved Standard Technical Specifications, NUREG 1431, Revision
0. Plant specific analysis demonstrates the proposed changes do not pose an undue risk and thus will not result in a
significant increase in the consequences of an accident.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
CRITERION 2
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Operation of this facility under the proposed Technical Specifications change will not create the possibility of
a new or different kind of accident from any accident previously evaluated. The safety injection, containment spray,
and residual heat removal pumps and valves and residual heat removal heat exchangers are used to mitigate the consequences
of an accident and are not normally in use during power operation. The availability of these components does not effect
the possibility of a new or different type of accident. The service water pumps are normally in use during power operation.
The proposed change will ensure that redundant train capability exists. Minimum service water pump requirements
remain the same. The failure modes of the service water system remain unchanged. Therefore, extending the allowed
out of service time does not create the possibility of a different type of accident than previously evaluated.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
CRITERION 3
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Operation of this facility under the proposed Technical Specifications change will not create a significant reduction
in a margin of safety. The proposed Technical Specification changes revise the allowed outage times for the safety
injection, residual heat removal, and containment spray pumps and valves and residual heat removal heat exchangers
to 72 hours. This change will allow more time for corrective maintenance to be performed on these components, if required,
and avoid potential transients and challenges to safety systems associated with a required shutdown of the unit without
the specific safety related equipment operable. The proposed changes are consistent with the Westinghouse Improved
Standard Technical Specifications, NUREG 1431, Revision 0. Plant specific analysis demonstrates the changes do
not pose an undue risk and thus will not result in a significant reduction in a margin of safety. The clarification to
the specification for service water pump operability may increase the margin of safety by ensuring that redundant
train capability exists.

1. Involve a Significant Increase in the Probability of Consequences of an Accident Previously Evaluated
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The probability of occurrence and the consequences of an accident evaluated previously in the Updated Safety Analysis
Report (USAR) are not increased due to the proposed technical specification change. Review of past ACOT history for
the affected monitors revealed that these monitors have experienced no calibration or setpoint-related problems
since the beginning of plant operation. Increasing the ACOT frequency for these monitors will not adversely affect
system operability, and this change would reduce the potential for instrument damage, thus effectively increasing
system reliability and availability. These radiation monitors are not accident-initiating equipment, so increasing
the surveillance interval on these monitors will not affect the probability of any accident previously evaluated.
In addition, for the monitors listed in TS Table 4.3-3, no credit is taken in the plant accident analyses in Chapter
15 of the USAR for any automatic actuation function generated as a result of a radiation monitor signal. On these bases
it is concluded that the probability and consequences of the accidents previously evaluated in the USAR are not increased.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
2. Create the Possibility of a New or Different Kind of Accident from any Previously Evaluated
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
No new type of accident or malfunction will be created since the radiation monitors are not accident-initiating equipment.
The proposed change merely increases the ACOT interval for the affected radiation monitors, and does not change the
method and manner of plant operation. The safety design bases in the USAR have not been altered. Thus, this change does
not create the possibility of a new or different kind of accident from any previously evaluated.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
3. Involve a Significant Reduction in the Margin of Safety
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The proposed changes do not change the plant configuration in a way that introduces a new potential hazard to the plant
and do not involve a significant reduction in the margin of safety. The proposed changes do not affect applicable safety
analysis acceptance criteria and will not affect system operating conditions. In addition, plant operating experience
has shown that these monitors have not experienced calibration of setpoint-related failures since the beginning
of plant operation. Therefore, it is concluded that the margin of safety, as described in the bases to any technical
specification, is not reduced.

Description of amendment request: 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The proposed amendment revises Technical Specification (TS) 6.2.2.g, 6.3.1.b, and 6.12.1.c to reflect title changes
in the Wolf Creek Nuclear Operating Corporation (WCNOC) organization. The title Supervisor Operations in TS 6.2.2.g
is being changed to Superintendent Operations. The title Radiation Protection Manager in TS 6.3.1.b and the title
Manager Radiation Protection in TS 6.12.1.c are being changed to Superintendent Radiation Protection. The title
changes do not represent any changes in reporting relationships, job responsibilities, or overall organizational
changes. This request supersedes a request for amendment dated April 19, 1994, which was noticed on June 22, 1994 (59
FR 32239)

Basis for proposed no significant hazards consideration determination: 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
As required by 10 CFR 50.91(a), the licensee has provided its analysis of the issue of no significant hazards consideration,
which is presented below:
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->
1. Proposed changes do not involve a significant increase in the probability or consequences of an accident previously
evaluated. These changes involve administrative changes to the WCNOC organization and to the position titles and
as such have no effect on plant equipment or the technical qualification of plant personnel.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
2. The proposed change does not create the possibility of a new or different kind of accident from any accident previously
evaluated. This change is administrative in nature and does not involve any change to the installed plant systems
or the overall operating philosophy of Wolf Creek Generating Station.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
3. The proposed change does not involve a significant reduction in a margin of safety. This change does not involve
any changes in overall organizational commitments. A position title change alone does not reduce the margin of safety.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
In a letter of August 13, 1993, and as supplemented on September 15, 1993, September 16, 1993, December 17, 1993, January
19, 1994, February 11, 1994, and February 24, 1994, Commonwealth Edison Company submitted requests for amendments
for steam generator (SG) tube sleeving in accordance with (1) Westinghouse and (2) Babcock &amp; Wilcox processes.
By letter dated March 4, 1994, the NRC granted the proposed sleeving methods contingent upon four conditions which
the licensee accepted in their letter of February 24, 1994.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Three of the four changes will be reflected in the plants' Technical Specifications (TS). By letter dated June 3, 1994,
the licensee requested changes to TS 3.4.5 and 3.4.6.2 to include the three conditions, which are:
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
1. Amend the Byron and Braidwood licenses to reflect a primary-to-secondary leakage rate limit of 150 gallons per
day (gpd) through any one SG.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
2. Amend the Byron and Braidwood licenses to reflect an inservice inspection of a minimum of 20 percent of a random sample
of the sleeves for axial and circumferential indication at the end-of-cycle. In the event that an imperfection of
40 percent or greater depth is detected, an additional 20 percent (minimum) of the unsampled sleeves should be inspected,
and if an imperfection of 40 percent or greater depth is detected in the second sample, all remaining sleeves should
be inspected. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
3. Add a condition to the Byron and Braidwood licenses to conduct additional corrosion testing to establish the design
life for the kinetically or laser welded sleeved tubes in the presence of a crevice. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Collectively, these conditions will enable the licensee to have:
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
1. Further assurance that the integrity of the SGs will be maintained in the event of a main steam line break or under
loss-of-coolant accident (LOCA) conditions;
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
2. Increased monitoring of the SG tube sleeves for any degradation; and
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
3. Increased confidence that SG sleeve integrity will be maintained for extended operations.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The proposed amendment would revise Section 4.4 of the Indian Point Nuclear Generating Unit No. 3 Power Plant Technical
Specifications. Specifically, TS 4.4.E.1 would be revised to allow a one-time extension to the 30-month interval
requirement for leak rate testing of Residual Heat Removal (RHR) containment isolation valves AC-732, AC-741, AC-MOV-743,
AC-MOV-744, and AC-MOV-1870. A one-time schedular exemption from plant specific requirements associated with
10 CFR Part 50, Appendix J, Type C testing (local leak rate test) for the above listed RHR containment isolation valves
will be processed separately. This one-time extension for leak rate testing of the RHR valves would defer the leak
rate testing until the next refueling outage, when the RHR system can be removed from service as required by current
procedures.

Brief description of amendments: 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
These amendments allow credit to be taken for burnup of spent fuel assemblies in establishing storage locations within
the spent fuel storage pool. The current spent fuel storage pool is configured to store fresh fuel assemblies with
a maximum radially average enrichment of 4.30 weight percent (w/o) U-235 in a two-out-of-four checkerboard array.
These amendments allow for three distinct storage regions. Region 1 allows storage of fresh fuel assemblies with
a maximum radially averaged enrichment equal to 4.30 w/o U-235 in a checkerboard configuration. Region 2 allows storage
of spent fuel assemblies in a three-out-of-four configuration. Region 3 allows storage of spent fuel assemblies
in every location (four-out-of-four configuration).

Brief description of amendment: 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The amendment revises Technical Specification Sections 3.1 and 4.1 for Protective Instrumentation, the associated
bases, and tables to increase the surveillance test intervals and add allowable out-of service times. The Technical
Specification changes will permit specified Channel Tests to be conducted quarterly rather than weekly or monthly.
The amendment will enhance operational safety by reducing (1) the potential for inadvertent plant scrams, (2) excessive
test cycles or equipment, and (3) the diversion of plant personnel and resources on unnecessary testing.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Two additional technical changes have been incorporated. The fist change involves extending the Channel Calibration
interval for Average Power Range Monitor. The second change would add a quarterly Channel Calibration requirement
for High Drywell Pressure (for Core Cooling) and Turbine Trip Scram Instrumentation. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Editorial changes have been incorporated in Instrumentation Sections 3.1 and 4.1 to provide clarity and consistency.

SI-1833A and B and add valves SI-MOV-1835A and B. The valves being deleted no longer perform a containment isolation
function as a result of a modification which removed the boron injection tank. The valves being added are needed for
testing the safety injection pumps.

The amendment revises the fuel oil availability requirements for the Emergency Diesel Generators (EDGs) from Section
3.7 of the Technical Specifications (TSs). This TS change requires that 30,026 gallons of fuel oil be available onsite
in addition to the oil in the EDG storage tanks. Specification 3.7.F.4 is also being changed to require a total of 7056
gallons of fuel in the EDG fuel oil storage tanks. In addition, administrative changes will remove the word ``available''
from the phrase ''... gallons of fuel available...'' in Section 3.7.A.5 (for the individual storage tanks) to avoid
confusion regarding the amount of usable fuel in the tanks.

The amendment revises Sections 3.4 and 3.5 of the Technical Specifications (TSs). The TS Section 3.4 revision reduces
the maximum allowable percent of rated power associated with inoperable Main Steam Safety Valves (MSSVs). This change
modifies Table 3.4-1 and the associated basis such that the maximum power level allowed for operation with inoperable
MSSVs is below the heat removing capability of the operable MSSVs. The TS Section 3.5 revision corrects administrative
errors in the action statements associated with Items 2.a and 2.c of Table 3.5-4. Additionally, the changes to Item
2.b of Table 3.5-3 and Item 2.b of Table 3.5-4 clarify the action statements associated with inoperable high containment
pressure (Hi-Hi Level) instrumentation.

Notice Of Issuance Of Amendments To Facility Operating Licenses And Final Determination Of No Significant Hazards
Consideration And Opportunity For A Hearing (Exigent Public Announcement Or Emergency Circumstances)
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
During the period since publication of the last biweekly notice, the Commission has issued the following amendments.
The Commission has determined for each of these amendments that the application for the amendment complies with the
standards and requirements of the Atomic Energy Act of 1954, as amended (the Act), and the Commission's rules and regulations.
The Commission has made appropriate findings as required by the Act and the Commission's rules and regulations in
10 CFR Chapter I, which are set forth in the license amendment. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Because of exigent or emergency circumstances associated with the date the amendment was needed, there was not time
for the Commission to publish, for public comment before issuance, its usual 30-day Notice of Consideration of Issuance
of Amendment, Proposed No Significant Hazards Consideration Determination, and Opportunity for a Hearing. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
For exigent circumstances, the Commission has either issued a 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 -->
Federal Register 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
notice providing opportunity for public comment or has used local media to provide notice to the public in the area
surrounding a licensee's facility of the licensee's application and of the Commission's proposed determination
of no significant hazards consideration. The Commission has provided a reasonable opportunity for the public to
comment, using its best efforts to make available to the public means of communication for the public to respond quickly,
and in the case of telephone comments, the comments have been recorded or transcribed as appropriate and the licensee
has been informed of the public comments.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In circumstances where failure to act in a timely way would have resulted, for example, in derating or shutdown of a
nuclear power plant or in prevention of either resumption of operation or of increase in power output up to the plant's
licensed power level, the Commission may not have had an opportunity to provide for public comment on its no significant
hazards consideration determination. In such case, the license amendment has been issued without opportunity for
comment. If there has been some time for public comment but less than 30 days, the Commission may provide an opportunity
for public comment. If comments have been requested, it is so stated. In either event, the State has been consulted
by telephone whenever possible.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Under its regulations, the Commission may issue and make an amendment immediately effective, notwithstanding the
pendency before it of a request for a hearing from any person, in advance of the holding and completion of any required
hearing, where it has determined that no significant hazards consideration is involved. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Commission has applied the standards of 10 CFR 50.92 and has made a final determination that the amendment involves
no significant hazards consideration. The basis for this determination is contained in the documents related to
this action. Accordingly, the amendments have been issued and made effective as indicated. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Unless otherwise indicated, the Commission has determined that these amendments satisfy the criteria for categorical
exclusion in accordance with 10 CFR 51.22. Therefore, pursuant to 10 CFR 51.22(b), no environmental impact statement
or environmental assessment need be prepared for these amendments. If the Commission has prepared an environmental
assessment under the special circumstances provision in 10 CFR 51.12(b) and has made a determination based on that
assessment, it is so indicated.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
For further details with respect to the action see (1) the application for amendment, (2) the amendment to Facility
Operating License, and (3) the Commission's related letter, Safety Evaluation and/or Environmental Assessment,
as indicated. All of these items are available for public inspection at the Commission's Public Document Room, the
Gelman Building, 2120 L Street, NW., Washington, DC 20555, and at the local public document room for the particular
facility involved. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Commission is also offering an opportunity for a hearing with respect to the issuance of the amendment. By November
25, 1995, the licensee may file a request for a hearing with respect to issuance of the amendment to the subject facility
operating license and any person whose interest may be affected by this proceeding and who wishes to participate as
a party in the proceeding must file a written request for a hearing and a petition for leave to intervene. Requests for
a hearing and a petition for leave to intervene shall be filed in accordance with the Commission's ``Rules of Practice
for Domestic Licensing Proceedings'' in 10 CFR Part 2. Interested persons should consult a current copy of 10 CFR 2.714
which is available at the Commission's Public Document Room, the Gelman Building, 2120 L Street, NW., Washington,
DC 20555 and at the local public document room for the particular facility involved. If a request for a hearing or petition
for leave to intervene is filed by the above date, the Commission or an Atomic Safety and Licensing Board, designated
by the Commission or by the Chairman of the Atomic Safety and Licensing Board Panel, will rule on the request and/or
petition; and the Secretary or the designated Atomic Safety and Licensing Board will issue a notice of a hearing or
an appropriate order. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
As required by 10 CFR 2.714, a petition for leave to intervene shall set forth with particularity the interest of the
petitioner in the proceeding, and how that interest may be affected by the results of the proceeding. The petition
should specifically explain the reasons why intervention should be permitted with particular reference to the following
factors: (1) the nature of the petitioner's right under the Act to be made a party to the proceeding; (2) the nature and
extent of the petitioner's property, financial, or other interest in the proceeding; and (3) the possible effect
of any order which may be entered in the proceeding on the petitioner's interest. The petition should also identify
the specific aspect(s) of the subject matter of the proceeding as to which petitioner wishes to intervene. Any person
who has filed a petition for leave to intervene or who has been admitted as a party may amend the petition without requesting
leave of the Board up to 15 days prior to the first prehearing conference scheduled in the proceeding, but such an amended
petition must satisfy the specificity requirements described above.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Not later than 15 days prior to the first prehearing conference scheduled in the proceeding, a petitioner shall file
a supplement to the petition to intervene which must include a list of the contentions which are sought to be litigated
in the matter. Each contention must consist of a specific statement of the issue of law or fact to be raised or controverted.
In addition, the petitioner shall provide a brief explanation of the bases of the contention and a concise statement
of the alleged facts or expert opinion which support the contention and on which the petitioner intends to rely in proving
the contention at the hearing. The petitioner must also provide references to those specific sources and documents
of which the petitioner is aware and on which the petitioner intends to rely to establish those facts or expert opinion.
Petitioner must provide sufficient information to show that a genuine dispute exists with the applicant on a material
issue of law or fact. Contentions shall be limited to matters within the scope of the amendment under consideration.
The contention must be one which, if proven, would entitle the petitioner to relief. A petitioner who fails to file
such a supplement which satisfies these requirements with respect to at least one contention will not be permitted
to participate as a party. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Those permitted to intervene become parties to the proceeding, subject to any limitations in the order granting leave
to intervene, and have the opportunity to participate fully in the conduct of the hearing, including the opportunity
to present evidence and cross-examine witnesses. Since the Commission has made a final determination that the amendment
involves no significant hazards consideration, if a hearing is requested, it will not stay the effectiveness of the
amendment. Any hearing held would take place while the amendment is in effect. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
A request for a hearing or a petition for leave to intervene must be filed with the Secretary of the Commission, U.S.
Nuclear Regulatory Commission, Washington, DC 20555, Attention: Docketing and Services Branch, or may be delivered
to the Commission's Public Document Room, the Gelman Building, 2120 L Street, NW., Washington, DC 20555, by the above
date. Where petitions are filed during the last 10 days of the notice period, it is requested that the petitioner promptly
so inform the Commission by a toll-free telephone call to Western Union at 1-(800) 248-5100 (in Missouri 1-(800) 342-6700).
The Western Union operator should be given Datagram Identification Number N1023 and the following message addressed

Washington, DC 20555, and to the attorney for the licensee. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Nontimely filings of petitions for leave to intervene, amended petitions, supplemental petitions and/or requests
for a hearing will not be entertained absent a determination by the Commission, the presiding officer or the Atomic
Safety and Licensing Board that the petition and/or request should be granted based upon a balancing of the factors
specified in 10 CFR 2.714(a)(1)(i)-(v) and 2.714(d).

Brief description of amendment: 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The proposed amendment would modify Technical Specification (TS) 4.8.2.1.e, ``DC Sources - Operating'' to specify
that the provisions of TS 4.0.1 and 4.0.4 are not applicable to the battery capacity requirements until entry into
Mode 4 coming out of the fifth refueling outage or upon any deep discharge cycle of the battery. The amendment was requested
on an emergency basis so that the licensee could declare the Unit 2 batteries operable based upon the current capacities
of the batteries without having to satisfy the surveillance requirement of TS 4.8.2.1.e. The licensee will thus be
able to change modes and start up from the current mid-cycle steam generator inspection outage.
