 FSIS is considering that the use of mechanically deboned chicken made, in whole or part, from fowl (i.e., mature female
chickens, as defined in 9 CFR 381.170(a)(1)(vi)) should not be permitted in baby, junior, or toddler foods. Also,
FSIS is considering that it should not be permitted in combination with MS(S) to constitute more than 20 percent of
the livestock and poultry product portion of any other poultry product or meat food product. These restrictions are
based on the potential fluoride contribution of product made from fowl to dietary intakes. The 1979 health and safety
report found only slight differences between the fluoride content of MDP made from poultry other than fowl and that
of poultry products produced by traditional deboning techniques, but considerably higher amounts in MDP made from
fowl.

FSIS believes that, in addition to prohibiting use of MDP made from fowl in baby (i.e., strained), junior, and toddler
foods, MDP also should be limited in other foods, because infants also consume table foods, with most eating adult-type
foods by age 2. This would limit the potential fluoride contribution to dietary intakes of other young children in
high fluoride areas. FSIS believes that MDP made from fowl should be limited to a maximum of 20 percent of the livestock
and poultry product portion of any poultry or meat food product.

Tentative position: Poultry product limitations.

 FSIS is considering that the use of MDP should be limited in certain poultry products. FSIS is considering allowing
MDP in the sauce portion or any dressing of poultry products and is soliciting comments on this use. FSIS is also soliciting
comments on whether MDP should be allowed in poultry products for which there are standards of identity or composition
(e.g., Boned (Kind)_Solid Pack, Boned (Kind) with Natural Juices, Shredded (Kind), (Kind) burgers, (Kind) A La Kiev
and (Kind) Steak or Fillet).

MDP is a finely comminuted ingredient and FSIS considers its use to be inconsistent with the basic characteristics
associated with poultry products that have been processed only to the extent of cutting or grinding or that are made
from poultry products so processed, such as chicken breasts, turkey fillets, and chicken burgers, or shredded chicken.
FSIS also considers its use to be inconsistent with the basic characteristics associated with poultry products that
are processed, convenience versions of ready-to-cook poultry or cuts or solid pieces of poultry or poultry meat,
such as roasted chicken, boned turkey with natural juices, chicken an la Kiev, and turkey ham. FSIS recognizes, however,
that these types of products sometimes are prepared with components the characteristics of which are not inconsistent
with those of MDP.

It is poultry meat_particular muscle(s)_that characterize cuts of poultry. The characteristics associated with
a cut can be retained when trimmings removed during processing are reincorporated; and the association with the cut
remains when there is chunking, chopping, or grinding of the muscle as in versions of turkey ham product (9 CFR 381.171).
FSIS regards these processes as different than using product made by the mechanical deboning of accompanying bones.
MDP does not, in FSIS's view, retain the characteristics of the cuts themselves. It appears inconsistent with the
basic characteristics expected of products represented as having been made from a particular part of the poultry
carcass, whether the muscle from that part is essentially intact or has been processed only to the extent of cutting
or grinding, to include this finely comminuted ingredient.

The same preparation procedures used in making a turkey ham product can be applied to other cuts, such as turkey breast,
for which definitions and standards have not been prescribed in subpart P of part 381 of the poultry products inspection
regulations (9 CFR part 381, subpart P). Cured turkey breast and turkey ham products have in common their method of
preparation and their association with a particular cut of poultry. They differ only in the cut of poultry product
used. As this difference is not relevant to whether inclusion of MDP would be appropriate, FSIS believes that use of
MDP should not be permitted in these products nor in products that are similar.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
FSIS is interested in receiving comments on its views as to the products in which use of MDP or its use in anything but
sauces and dressings should be prohibited as inconsistent with their basic characteristics, including data and
other information on the effects of using MDP on the characteristics and quality of specific products. Persons who
support allowing use of MDP in any of the poultry products covered in the above discussion should be aware that FSIS
is interested in their views.
