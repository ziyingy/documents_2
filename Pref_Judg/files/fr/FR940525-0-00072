(ii) Based on discussions at the meeting, which could include participation by the Pelagics Plan Team, Advisory Subpanel,
Pelagics Review Board, Scientific and Statistical Committee, or other Council organizations, the Council will
decide whether to recommend action by the Regional Director. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(iii) The Regional Director will be asked to indicate any special concerns or objections to the possible actions being
considered under the framework process and, if there are any concerns or objections, will be asked for ways to resolve
them. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(3) If the Council decides to proceed, a document will be prepared describing the problem and the proposed regulatory
adjustment to resolve it. The document will demonstrate how the adjustment is consistent with the purposes of the
established measure and that the impacts had been addressed in the document supporting the original imposition of
the measure. The document will be submitted to the Regional Director with a recommendation for action. The Council
may indicate its intent that the recommendations are to be approved or disapproved as a single action. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(4) If the Regional Director approves part or all of the Council's recommendation, the Secretary, in accordance with
the Administrative Procedure Act, may implement the approved change in an established measure by publishing a final
rule, waiving advance notice and comment. This does not preclude the Secretary from deciding to provide additional
opportunity for advance notice and comment, but contemplates that the Council process will satisfy the requirements
of the Magnuson Act and Administrative Procedure Act regarding prior notice and comment. Established measures are
measures that have been evaluated and applied in the past, and adjustments under this framework must be consistent
with the original intent of the measure and within the scope of analysis in previous documents supporting the existing
measure. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(5) Nothing in this section limits the authority of the Secretary to take emergency action under section 305(c) of
the Magnuson Act.

Procedure for implementing new measures
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
. (1) New measures are those that have not been used before or measures that, while previously applied, would be applied
to another fishing sector (e.g., non-longline pelagic fishery) or gear type for the first time. New measures may have
been previously considered in a past FMP amendment or document, but the specific impacts on the persons to whom the
measures would newly apply have not been evaluated in the context of current conditions. Potential new measures include,
but are not limited to: Permit requirements for new fishery sectors; reporting requirements for a fishery sector
other than longline fishing; effort limitations; quotas (for total catch or by species), including individual transferable
quotas; fractional licensing; or bycatch limits. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(2) A Pelagics Plan Team report (annual report or an in-season report), input from advisors, or input from NMFS or other
agencies will first bring attention to a problem or issue that needs to be addressed at the next Council meeting. In
its notice announcing the meeting, the Council will summarize the concern or issue raised, the party that has raised
the problem, and the extent to which it is a new problem or a problem that may require new management measures. The Council
will seek to identify all interested persons and organizations and solicit their involvement in discussion and resolution
of this problem through the Council process, and the Council meeting notice in the 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 -->
Federal Register
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 will emphasize that this problem will be discussed and that proposed actions may result. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(3) The document presenting the problem to the attention of the Council will be distributed to all advisory bodies
of the Council who have not yet received it, with a request for comments. The document also will be distributed to the
Council's mailing list associated with the Fishery Management Plan to solicit comments and to indicate the Council
will take up action at the following meeting. The Council's chairperson may request the Council's Pelagics Standing
Committee to discuss the issue and review the comments (if any) of the Pelagics Plan Team, Advisory Panel, Pelagics
Review Board, or Scientific and Statistical Committee, and develop recommendations for Council action. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(4) At the meeting, the Council will consider the recommendations of its Pelagics Standing Committee, if any, and
other Council organizations and will take comments from the public concerning the possible course of action. If the
Council agrees to proceed with further action under the framework process, the issue will be placed on the agenda for
the following meeting. A document describing the issue, alternative ways to resolve the issue, the preferred action,
and the anticipated impacts of the preferred action, will be prepared and distributed to the public with a request
for comments. A notice will be published in the 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 -->
Federal Register
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 summarizing the Council's deliberations and preferred action and indicating the time and place for the Council meeting
to take final action. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(5) In its notice for the following meeting, the Council will indicate that it may take final action on the possible
adjustment to regulations under this section. At the meeting, the Council will consider the comments received as
a result of its solicitation of comments and take public comments during the meeting on the issue or problem. The Council
will consider any new information presented or collected and analyzed during the comment period. The Regional Director
will be provided a specific opportunity to indicate any objections or concerns about any or all components of the measures
being considered. The Council will then decide whether to recommend a new measure or measures under this section.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(6) If the Council decides to proceed, it will submit its proposal to the Regional Director for consideration, with
supporting rationale and an analysis of the estimated biological, economic, and social impacts of the proposed actions.
The Council may indicate its intent that all components of its recommendations be approved or disapproved as a single
action. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(7) If the Regional Director concurs in whole or in part, the Secretary, in accordance with the Administrative Procedure
Act, may implement the approved new measure by publishing a final rule, waiving advance notice and comment. Nothing
in this procedure is intended to preclude the Secretary from deciding to provide additional opportunity for advance
notice and comment in the 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 -->
Federal Register
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
, but contemplates, that the Council process (which includes two Council meetings with opportunity for public comment
at each) will satisfy that requirement. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(8) If a new action is approved and implemented, future adjustments may be made under the procedure for established
measures. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(9) Nothing in this section limits the authority of the Secretary to take emergency action under section 305(c) of
the Magnuson Act.
