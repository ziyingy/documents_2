Section 1902(m) of the Act has always specified that resources of individuals under the low-income optional categorically
needy group of aged and disabled individuals may not exceed the SSI limits, and that SSI methodologies must be used
to determine countable income and resources. However, section 1902(r)(2) of the Act, as added by section 303(e) of
MCCA, does permit States, at their option, to use less restrictive requirements than SSI for optional categorically
needy groups. However, in spite of section 1902(r)(2), we do not believe that States are authorized to allow individuals
to deduct (spend down) the costs incurred for medical care or any other type of remedial care from income in order to
meet the income standard established, except as they are permitted to do so under SSI if the individual is a severely
disabled person who works. This is because section 1902(m)(3)(B) of the Act specifically prohibits the use of an income
spenddown, except in the case of individuals covered by section 1612(b)(4)(B)(ii) of the Act. Under this exception,
a severely disabled individual who works is allowed to deduct from income the reasonable costs for attendant care
services, medical devices, equipment, prostheses, and similar items and services (generally not including routine
drugs or routine medical services) that are necessary in order for the individual to work.

Section 6411(a) of OBRA '89 amended section 1902(f) of the Act to eliminate the option to use more restrictive eligibility
criteria than are used by the SSI program for certain eligibility groups. One of those groups is the optional low-income
aged and disabled group. Therefore, section 1902(f) States that elect to cover the section 1902(m) group must use
SSI eligibility methodologies, and the statutorily mandated income and resource standards, in determining eligibility
for individuals under this group. The only exception is that section 1902(f) States can use more liberal criteria
under section 1902(r)(2). (Guam, Puerto Rico, and the Virgin Islands would use the SSI disability definition under
section 1614 of the Act and the methodologies for determining income and resource eligibility applied under sections
1612 and 1613, or less restrictive income and resource methodologies under section 1902(r)(2), as appropriate.
This is because the reference in section 1902(m) relating to disability and financial methodologies is to those of
title XVI (that is, SSI) and not to those of the State plan program under title XVI.)
