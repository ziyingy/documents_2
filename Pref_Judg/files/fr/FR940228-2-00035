El Paso, it is said, installed the Cabot Hobbs Meter Station under Section 311(a) of the NGPA and has exclusively used
it for the transportation and delivery of natural gas under Part 284, Subpart B. El Paso states that the regulatory
restriction placed on the operation of a facility installed under Section 311(a) of the NGPA prohibits El Paso's shippers
from utilizing this delivery point under any transportation arrangement other than a Subpart B transportation arrangement.

El Paso states further that it now requests authorization to continue the operation of the facility under the Natural
Gas Act.
