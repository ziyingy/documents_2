I. Background
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Pursuant to Public Law 97-415, the U.S. Nuclear Regulatory Commission (the Commission or NRC staff) is publishing
this regular biweekly notice. Public Law 97-415 revised section 189 of the Atomic Energy Act of 1954, as amended (the
Act), to require the Commission to publish notice of any amendments issued, or proposed to be issued, under a new provision
of section 189 of the Act. This provision grants the Commission the authority to issue and make immediately effective
any amendment to an operating license upon a determination by the Commission that such amendment involves no significant
hazards consideration, notwithstanding the pendency before the Commission of a request for a hearing from any person.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
This biweekly notice includes all notices of amendments issued, or proposed to be issued from December 13, 1993, through
December 22, 1993. The last biweekly notice was published on December 22, 1993 (58 FR 67840).

Notice of Consideration of Issuance of Amendments to Facility Operating Licenses, Proposed No Significant Hazards
Consideration Determination, and Opportunity for a Hearing
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The Commission has made a proposed determination that the following amendment requests involve no significant hazards
consideration. Under the Commission's regulations in 10 CFR 50.92, this means that operation of the facility in accordance
with the proposed amendment would not (1) involve a significant increase in the probability or consequences of an
accident previously evaluated; or (2) create the possibility of a new or different kind of accident from any accident
previously evaluated; or (3) involve a significant reduction in a margin of safety. The basis for this proposed determination
for each amendment request is shown below. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Commission is seeking public comments on this proposed determination. Any comments received within 30 days after
the date of publication of this notice will be considered in making any final determination. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Normally, the Commission will not issue the amendment until the expiration of the 30-day notice period. However,
should circumstances change during the notice period such that failure to act in a timely way would result, for example,
in derating or shutdown of the facility, the Commission may issue the license amendment before the expiration of the
30-day notice period, provided that its final determination is that the amendment involves no significant hazards
consideration. The final determination will consider all public and State comments received before action is taken.
Should the Commission take this action, it will publish in the 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 -->
Federal Register 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
a notice of issuance and provide for opportunity for a hearing after issuance. The Commission expects that the need
to take this action will occur very infrequently. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Written comments may be submitted by mail to the Rules Review and Directives Branch, Division of Freedom of Information
and Publications Services, Office of Administration, U.S. Nuclear Regulatory Commission, Washington, DC 20555,
and should cite the publication date and page number of this 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 -->
Federal Register 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
notice. Written comments may also be delivered to Room P-223, Phillips Building, 7920 Norfolk Avenue, Bethesda,
Maryland from 7:30 a.m. to 4:15 p.m. Federal workdays. Copies of written comments received may be examined at the NRC
Public Document Room, the Gelman Building, 2120 L Street, NW., Washington, DC 20555. The filing of requests for a hearing
and petitions for leave to intervene is discussed below.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
By February 4, 1994, the licensee may file a request for a hearing with respect to issuance of the amendment to the subject
facility operating license and any person whose interest may be affected by this proceeding and who wishes to participate
as a party in the proceeding must file a written request for a hearing and a petition for leave to intervene. Requests
for a hearing and a petition for leave to intervene shall be filed in accordance with the Commission's ``Rules of Practice
for Domestic Licensing Proceedings'' in 10 CFR Part 2. Interested persons should consult a current copy of 10 CFR 2.714
which is available at the Commission's Public Document Room, the Gelman Building, 2120 L Street, NW., Washington,
DC 20555 and at the local public document room for the particular facility involved. If a request for a hearing or petition
for leave to intervene is filed by the above date, the Commission or an Atomic Safety and Licensing Board, designated
by the Commission or by the Chairman of the Atomic Safety and Licensing Board Panel, will rule on the request and/or
petition; and the Secretary or the designated Atomic Safety and Licensing Board will issue a notice of a hearing or
an appropriate order. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
As required by 10 CFR 2.714, a petition for leave to intervene shall set forth with particularity the interest of the
petitioner in the proceeding, and how that interest may be affected by the results of the proceeding. The petition
should specifically explain the reasons why intervention should be permitted with particular reference to the following
factors: (1) the nature of the petitioner's right under the Act to be made a party to the proceeding; (2) the nature and
extent of the petitioner's property, financial, or other interest in the proceeding; and (3) the possible effect
of any order which may be entered in the proceeding on the petitioner's interest. The petition should also identify
the specific aspect(s) of the subject matter of the proceeding as to which petitioner wishes to intervene. Any person
who has filed a petition for leave to intervene or who has been admitted as a party may amend the petition without requesting
leave of the Board up to 15 days prior to the first prehearing conference scheduled in the proceeding, but such an amended
petition must satisfy the specificity requirements described above.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Not later than 15 days prior to the first prehearing conference scheduled in the proceeding, a petitioner shall file
a supplement to the petition to intervene which must include a list of the contentions which are sought to be litigated
in the matter. Each contention must consist of a specific statement of the issue of law or fact to be raised or controverted.
In addition, the petitioner shall provide a brief explanation of the bases of the contention and a concise statement
of the alleged facts or expert opinion which support the contention and on which the petitioner intends to rely in proving
the contention at the hearing. The petitioner must also provide references to those specific sources and documents
of which the petitioner is aware and on which the petitioner intends to rely to establish those facts or expert opinion.
Petitioner must provide sufficient information to show that a genuine dispute exists with the applicant on a material
issue of law or fact. Contentions shall be limited to matters within the scope of the amendment under consideration.
The contention must be one which, if proven, would entitle the petitioner to relief. A petitioner who fails to file
such a supplement which satisfies these requirements with respect to at least one contention will not be permitted
to participate as a party. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Those permitted to intervene become parties to the proceeding, subject to any limitations in the order granting leave
to intervene, and have the opportunity to participate fully in the conduct of the hearing, including the opportunity
to present evidence and cross-examine witnesses. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
If a hearing is requested, the Commission will make a final determination on the issue of no significant hazards consideration.
The final determination will serve to decide when the hearing is held. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
If the final determination is that the amendment request involves no significant hazards consideration, the Commission
may issue the amendment and make it immediately effective, notwithstanding the request for a hearing. Any hearing
held would take place after issuance of the amendment. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
If the final determination is that the amendment request involves a significant hazards consideration, any hearing
held would take place before the issuance of any amendment. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
A request for a hearing or a petition for leave to intervene must be filed with the Secretary of the Commission, U.S.
Nuclear Regulatory Commission, Washington, DC 20555, Attention: Docketing and Services Branch, or may be delivered
to the Commission's Public Document Room, the Gelman Building, 2120 L Street, NW., Washington DC 20555, by the above
date. Where petitions are filed during the last 10 days of the notice period, it is requested that the petitioner promptly
so inform the Commission by a toll-free telephone call to Western Union at 1-(800) 248-5100 (in Missouri 1-(800) 342-6700).
The Western Union operator should be given Datagram Identification Number N1023 and the following message addressed
to

notice. A copy of the petition should also be sent to the Office of the General Counsel, U.S. Nuclear Regulatory Commission,
Washington, DC 20555, and to the attorney for the licensee. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Nontimely filings of petitions for leave to intervene, amended petitions, supplemental petitions and/or requests
for a hearing will not be entertained absent a determination by the Commission, the presiding officer or the Atomic
Safety and Licensing Board that the petition and/or request should be granted based upon a balancing of factors specified
in 10 CFR 2.714(a)(1)(i)-(v) and 2.714(d).

Description of amendment requests: 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The proposed changes would modify TS 3/4.6.1.2 by removing the schedular requirements for a Type A (overall integrated
containment leakage rate) test to be performed specifically at 40 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=8 f=1 -->

 10 month intervals and replacing these requirements with a requirement to perform Type A testing in accordance with
Appendix J to 10 CFR 50. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Basis for proposed no significant hazards consideration determination: 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
As required by 10 CFR 50.91(a), the licensees have provided their analysis about the issue of no significant hazards
consideration, which is presented below:
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->
(1) The proposed changes would not involve an increase in the probability or the consequences of an accident previously
evaluated. The proposed change only allows flexibility in the scheduling of the three required Type A tests in the
10-year service period. The additional flexibility is needed for plants using 18-month fuel cycles to allow refueling
outages and testing intervals to coincide. There is no change to the number of tests required, test methodology, or
acceptance criteria.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(2) The proposed changes would not create the possibility of a new or different type of accident from any accident previously
evaluated. The proposed change to the test schedule only provides flexibility in meeting the same requirement for
three tests in a 10-year period. The testing type and bases have not changed. Therefore, operation of the units with
this more flexible test schedule will not result in an accident previously not analyzed in the Updated Final Safety
Analysis Report (UFSAR). The proposed changes do not impact the design bases of the containment and do not modify the
response of the containment during a design basis accident.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(3) The proposed changes would not involve a reduction in the margin of safety. The proposed changes to the schedule
only provides flexibility in meeting the same requirement for three tests in a 10-year period. These proposed changes
do not affect or change any limiting conditions for operation (LCO), or any other surveillance requirements in the
TS, and the basis for the surveillance requirement remains unchanged. The testing method, acceptance criteria,
and bases are not changed. The TS continue to require testing that is consistent with the requirements of Appendix
J to 10 CFR 50.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The NRC staff has reviewed the licensees' analysis and, based on that review, it appears that the three standards of
50.92(c) are satisfied. Therefore, the NRC staff proposes to determine that the amendment requests involve no significant
hazards consideration.

Description of amendment request: 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The proposed amendment would permit extending the time to perform leak rate testing of certain containment isolation
valves so that the testing can be performed during the refueling outage scheduled to start April 16, 1994, rather than
requiring an earlier shutdown solely to perform the testing. The proposed amendment would revise Surveillance Requirements
4.6.1.3d and 4.6.1.3f to allow a one-time extension of the surveillance intervals for leak rate testing of containment
isolation valves. In addition, the proposed amendment would revise Surveillance Requirements 4.4.3.2.2a and 4.4.3.2.2b,
replacing the requirement to leak test the reactor coolant pressure isolation valves every 18 months or prior to returning
a valve to service, with a requirement to leak test the valves in accordance with the Inservice Testing Program. This
would allow the testing to be performed during the fifth refueling outage. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Basis for proposed no significant hazards consideration determination: 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
As required by 10 CFR 50.91(a), the licensee has provided its analysis of the issue of no significant hazards consideration.
The NRC staff has reviewed the licensee's analysis against the standards of 10 CFR 50.92(c). The NRC staff's review
is presented below:
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
1. The proposed changes would not significantly increase the probability or consequences of a previously evaluated
accident. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
One of the proposed technical specification (TS) changes requests a one-time only extension of the surveillance
intervals for the TS Surveillance Requirements of TS 4.6.1.3f, leak rate testing of valves sealed by the main steam
positive leakage control system (MS-PLCS) and the penetration valve leakage control system (PVLCS). The revision
would permit eleven containment isolation valves to be tested a maximum of 46 days later than required by current technical
specifications.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
To permit the one-time extension of the surveillance interval for leak rate tests of containment isolation valves,
TS 4.6.1.3d must also be revised to permit the interval for Type C leak rate tests to exceed 24 months. This change is
consistent with an associated exemption request. The exemption request and this revision would permit 20 valves
to be tested a maximum of 35 days later than required by the current technical specifications.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The proposed amendment would also revise Surveillance Requirements 4.4.3.2.2a and 4.4.3.2.2b, replacing the requirement
to leak test the reactor coolant pressure isolation valves every 18 months or prior to returning a valve to service,
with a requirement to leak test the valves in accordance with the Inservice Testing Program. This change would require
that the pressure isolation valves be tested in accordance with Section XI of the ASME Boiler and Pressure Vessel Code,
resulting in the valves being tested at least every refueling outage, rather than specifying an 18 month cycle. The
revision would permit five valves to be tested a maximum of 65 days later than allowed under the current technical specification.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Based on the short duration of the requested extensions, the extensions will not significantly increase the probability
or consequences of a previously evaluated accident.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
2. The proposed changes would not create the possibility of a new or different kind of accident from any previously
evaluated.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The proposed TS changes permit extension of the surveillance intervals for leak rate testing of containment isolation
valves and reactor coolant system pressure isolation valves. In that the requested extension durations are small
as compared to the overall interval allowed by TS, the proposed changes do not create the possibility of a new or different
kind of accident from any accident previously analyzed.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
3. The proposed changes would not involve a significant reduction in the margin of safety.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The proposed TS changes permit extension of the surveillance intervals for leak rate testing of containment isolation
valves and reactor coolant system pressure isolation valves. In that the requested extension durations are small
as compared to the overall interval allowed by TS, the proposed changes do not involve a significant reduction in the
margin of safety.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Based on this review, it appears that the three standards of 10 CFR 50.92(c) are satisfied. Therefore, the NRC staff
proposes to determine that the amendment request involves no significant hazards consideration.

Basis for proposed no significant hazards consideration determination: 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
As required by 10 CFR 50.91(a), the licensee has provided its analysis of the issue of no significant hazards consideration,
which is presented below:
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->
1. The proposed amendment does not involve a significant increase in the probability or consequences of an accident
previously evaluated. The proposed change corrects Technical Specification pages issued for Amendment 166 for
Brunswick Unit 1 and Amendment 197 for Brunswick Unit 2, regarding NUMAC Steam Leak Detection Equipment. Specifically,
on page 3/4 3-29 for each unit, the Channel Calibration frequency of Item 4.a.4, HPCI [High Pressure Core Injection]
Steam Line Tunnel Temperature - High, was inadvertently left as quarterly (Q) rather than being revised to refuel
(R). The text of CP&amp;L's September 14, 1992 license amendment request and the NRC's safety evaluation for Amendments
166 and 197, dated October 14, 1993, addressed the frequency change from quarterly to refuel for this item. Therefore,
the proposed change is purely administrative in nature and can not involve a significant increase in the probability
of consequences of an accident previously evaluated. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
2. The proposed amendment does not create the possibility of a new or different kind of accident from any accident previously
evaluated. As stated above, the NRC's safety evaluation for Amendments 166 and 197, dated October 14, 1993, addressed
the frequency change from quarterly to refuel for Item 4.a.4 of Table 4.3.2-1, HPCI Steam Line Tunnel Temperature
- High. Therefore, the proposed change is purely administrative in nature and can not create the possibility of a new
or different kind of accident from any accident previously evaluated. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
3. The proposed license amendment does not involve a significant reduction in the margin of safety. The proposed change
corrects Technical Specification pages issued for Amendment 166 for Brunswick Unit 1 and Amendment 197 for Brunswick
Unit 2, regarding NUMAC Steam Leak Detection Equipment. The NRC's safety evaluation for Amendments 166 and 197, dated
October 14, 1993, addressed the change of Channel Calibration frequency of Item 4.a.4, HPCI Steam Line Tunnel Temperature
- High from quarterly (Q) to refuel (R). Therefore, the proposed change is purely administrative and can not involve
a significant reduction in the margin of safety.

1. Will operation of the facility according to this proposed change involve a significant increase in the probability
or consequences of an accident previously evaluated?
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The proposed change is to bring the LACBWR Technical Specifications into conformance with the revised 10 CFR Part
20 and to correct several editorial oversights previously evaluated. The proposed change has no affect on any plant
operating parameters. Consequently, the proposed change does not involve a significant increase in the probability
or consequences of an accident previously evaluated.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
2. Will operation of the facility according to this proposed change create the possibility of a new or different kind
of accident from any previously evaluated?
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The proposed change is to bring the LACBWR Technical Specifications into conformance with the revised 10 CFR Part
20 and to correct several editorial oversights previously evaluated. The proposed change is administrative in nature.
Further, the proposed change does not result in any physical alteration to any plant system, and does not result in
any change in the method by which any safety-related system performs its function. Consequently, the proposed change
does not create the possibility of a new or different kind of accident from any accident previously evaluated.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
3. Will operation of the facility according to this proposed change involve a significant reduction in a margin of
safety?
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The margin of safety is the difference between the value of a critical design, operating, or post accident parameter,
and the value of the parameter which would produce unacceptable results. The proposed change does not affect any hardware,
has no effect on the current operating methodologies or actions which govern plant performance, and does not affect
any accident analysis parameter. Consequently, the proposed change does not involve a significant reduction in
a margin of safety.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The NRC staff has determined based on its own no significant hazards consideration evaluation that the three standards
of 50.92(c) are satisfied. Therefore, the NRC staff proposes to determine that the amendment request involves no
significant hazards consideration.

There are no structural mechanisms which would adversely affect the structural capability of the containment and
that would be a factor in extending the Type A test schedule to ten years. A risk impact assessment was performed, and
a determination was made that there is no risk impact as a result of changing the Type A test schedule. Therefore, the
proposed change will not involve a significant increase in the probability or consequences of any accident previously
evaluated.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
There are no design changes being made that would create a new type of accident or malfunction. The proposed change
will not alter the plant or the manner in which it is operated. The change proposes a change to the schedule for performing
the periodic Type A test. The purpose of the test is to provide periodic verification by test of the leaktight integrity
of the primary reactor containment, and systems and components which penetrate containment. The tests assure that
leakage through containment and systems and components penetrating containment will not exceed the allowable leakage
rate values associated with conditions resulting from an accident. The change in schedule for performing the Type
A test will not adversely affect the containment integrity in the event of an accident. Therefore, the proposed change
will not create the possibility of a new or different type of accident from any accident previously evaluated.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The proposed change is a change to the schedule for performing the periodic Type A tests and does not reduce the margin
of safety assumed in accident analysis for release of radioactive materials from the containment atmosphere into
the environment or any margin of safety preserved by the Technical Specifications. The methodology, acceptance
criteria, and the technical specification leakage limits for the performance of the Type A tests will not change,
and the Type A tests will be performed in accordance with 10CFR 50, Appendix J, and the Waterford 3 licensing basis.
Therefore, the proposed change will not involve a significant reduction in a margin of safety.

Description of amendment request: 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The proposed amendment would revise the Technical Specifications (TSs) to provide acceptable conditions for operation
when (1) the core operating limits supervisory system (COLSS) is in service and neither control element assembly
calculator (CEAC) is operable and (2) the COLSS is out of service and either or both CEACs are operable. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
This proposed TS change modifies the departure from nucleate boiling ratio (DNBR) margin, Limiting Condition for
Operation (LCO) 3.2.4b and c, which limits the core power distribution to the initial value assumed in the accident
analyses. Operation within this LCO either limits or prevents potential fuel cladding failures in the event of a postulated
accident and limits damage to the fuel cladding during an accident by ensuring that the plant is operating within acceptable
conditions at the onset of a transient. The limiting safety system settings and this LCO are based on the accident analysis,
so that specified acceptable fuel design limits (SAFDLs) are not exceeded as a result of anticipated operational
occurrences (AOOs) and the limits of acceptable consequences are not exceeded for other postulated accidents.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The COLSS and core protection calculators (CPCs) monitor the core power distribution on line and are capable of verifying
that the linear heat rate (LHR) and DNBR do not exceed their limits. The COLSS performs this function by continuously
monitoring the core power distribution and calculating core power operating limits corresponding to the allowable
peak LHR and DNBR. The CPCs perform this function by continuously calculating an actual value of DNBR and LHR for comparison
with the respective trip setpoints. CEACs monitor CEA position. Should a CEA deviate from its subgroup position,
the CEACs will transmit an appropriate ``penalty'' factor to the CPCs.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The COLSS is normally used to monitor DNBR margin. When at least one CEAC is operable, TS 3.2.4a provides enough margin
to DNB to accommodate the limiting AOO without failing the fuel. When neither CEAC is operable, the CPCs lack the CEA
position information necessary to ensure a reactor trip when necessary. In this case TS 3.2.4b requires the COLSS
calculated core power to be reduced to ensure that the limiting AOO will not result in fuel failure. Currently, TS 3.2.4b
requires that the COLSS calculated power be maintained at 13% below the COLSS calculated power operating limit to
compensate for the potential error in the CPC DNBR calculation. The proposed revision would increase this required
adjustment to 16%, which is more restrictive than the present value.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In instances when the COLSS is out of service, but either or both CEACs are operable, TS 3.2.4c states that the DNBR operating
margin shall be maintained by comparing the DNBR indicated on any operable CPC channel with the allowable value from
TS Figure 3.2-2. Whenever the COLSS is out of service, the CPCs are used to perform the same monitoring function. However,
the extra conservatisms built into the CPCs for transient protection are not all required when the CPCs are being used
for monitoring. In order not to affect the CPC transient protection, these conservatisms are not taken from the CPC,
but are credited in the COLSS out-of-service limits in Figure 3.2-2. A reevaluation of the limiting AOOs has verified
that, by maintaining the margin in the proposed Figure 3.2-2, sufficient margin exists to ensure that the limiting
Cycle 7 AOO will not result in fuel failure.

Basis for proposed no significant hazards consideration determination: 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
As required by 10 CFR 50.91(a), the licensee has provided its analysis of the issue of no significant hazards consideration,
which is presented below:
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->
For the case when neither CEAC is operable but COLSS is in service, the CPCs assume a preset CEA configuration and can
not obtain the required CEA position information to ensure the SAFDL on DNBR will not be violated during an AOO. Thus,
as a result of limiting AOOs for Cycle 7, Specification 3.2.4b requires that core power be reduced to a value 16% less
than the current COLSS calculated power operating limit. This ensures the limiting AOO will not result in a violation
of SAFDLs. The proposed revision to Figure 3.2-2 accounts for the situation when COLSS is out of service but at least
one CEAC is operable. In this case, the Cycle 7 safety analysis has shown that by maintaining the CPC calculated DNBR
above the value shown in the figure, the limiting AOO will not result in a violation of the SAFDLs. Therefore, the proposed
change will not significantly increase the probability or consequences of any accident previously evaluated.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The proposed changes are primarily a result of changes in Cycle 7 core parameters. These changes do not involve any
change to any equipment or manner in which the plant will be operated. These changes further restrict the plant operation
when either COLSS or both CEACs are out of service. Therefore, the proposed change will not create the possibility
of a new or different kind of accident from any accident previously evaluated.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The intent of this Specification is to ensure that there is always sufficient margin to DNB such that the CPCs can mitigate
the consequences of the most limiting AOO prior to a violation of the SAFDLs. Generally, this margin is continuously
monitored by COLSS; however, if COLSS is out of service, but at least one CEAC is operable, the limitation on CPC calculated
DNBR (as a function of ASI [axial shape index]) shown in Figure 3.2-2 represents a conservative envelope of operating
conditions consistent with the Cycle 7 safety analysis assumptions. This band of operating conditions has been analytically
demonstrated to maintain an acceptable minimum DNBR through all AOOs. On the other hand, for the case when COLSS is
in service, but neither CEAC is operable, the proposed change will ensure that the limiting AOO will not result in a
violation of SAFDLs. Therefore, the proposed changes will not result in a significant reduction in the margin of safety.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The purpose of the request is to change the plant Technical Specifications (TS) to remove the limiting conditions
for operation and surveillance requirements for the chlorine detection system. TMI-1 removed the gases Chlorination
System for the Circulating Water and River Water Systems. This modification eliminated the need for a Chlorine Dectection

As required by 10 CFR 50.91(a), the licensee has provided its analysis of the issue of no significant hazards consideration,
which is presented below:
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->
1. Operation of the facility in accordance with the proposed amendment would not involve a significant increase in
the probability of occurrence or the consequences of an accident previously evaluated. The TS requirements assured
the operability of the CDS in the event of an on-site chlorine release from a one ton cylinder. These TS requirements
reduced the probability and the consequences of a radiological accident which may result from an incapacitation
of control room operatorsafter entry of chlorine into the control room. With the removal and the restriction on delivery
of one ton chlorine cylinders, this postulated event is no longer credible, and there is a decrease in the probability
of a radiological accident.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
2. Operation of the facility in accordance with the proposed amendment would not create the possibility of a new or
different kind of accident from any accident previously evaluated. The TS requirements associated with the CDS were
for the on-site release of chlorine from a one ton cylinder. These cylinders are removed and prohibited from the TMI-1
site. These actions preclude a significant on-site release of chlorine which could affect the control room operators.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
3. Operation of the facility in accordance with the proposed amendment would not involve a significant reduction
in a margin of safety. The purpose of the TS requirements was to maintain operability of the CDS in the event of on-site
release from a one ton chlorine cylinder. Since chlorine cylinders greater than 150 pounds are prohibited on-site,
the TS requirements for chlorine detection are no longer required, and their removal will not reduce the margin of
safety.

1. The proposed change does not involve a significant increase in the probability or consequences of an accident previously
evaluated.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The proposed change seeks to eliminate the unnecessary testing of an operable Standby Diesel Generator (SDG). Technical
Specification (TS) 3.8.1.1 Actions a. and e. require all operable SDGs be started as a demonstration of operability
whenever one or more of the offsite AC [alternating current] power sources is declared inoperable. The inoperability
of an offsite AC power source has no effect on the reliability of a SDG. Deleting this requirement does not affect the
design or performance characteristics of the SDGs. Therefore, the SDGs maintain their ability to perform their design
function.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
TS 3.8.1.1 Actions b. and c. require all remaining operable SDGs be started as a demonstration of operability whenever
one of the SDG is declared inoperable except for preplanned preventive maintenance or testing. The proposed amendment
would expand the testing exclusion to include an inoperable support system and an independently testable component
in addition to preplanned preventive maintenance and testing. The proposed amendment would also eliminate the testing
requirement of the remaining operable SDGs, when a SDG is declared inoperable, unless there is cause to believe a potential
common mode failure exists for the remaining SDGs. The normal TS surveillance testing schedule assures that operable
SDG(s) are capable of performing their intended safety functions. A failure of one SDG does not reduce the reliability
of another, otherwise operable SDG. Deleting this requirement does not affect the design or performance characteristics
of the SDGs, once a common mode failure has been dismissed. Therefore, the SDGs maintain their ability to perform their
design function.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
2. The proposed change does not create the possibility of a new or different kind of accident from any previously evaluated.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The elimination of these unnecessary tests does not affect the design bases of the SDGs, or any of the accident evaluations
involving the SDGs. The SDGs are designed to provide electrical power to the equipment important for safety during
all modes and plant conditions following a loss of offsite power. The test schedule established in accordance with
GL 84-15 [``Proposed Staff Actions To Improve and Maintain Diesel Generator Reliability''] assures that operable
SDGs are capable of performing their intended safety function. Therefore, this change does not create the possibility
of a new or different kind of accident from any previously evaluated. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
3. The proposed change does not involve a significant reduction in the margin of safety.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Since the proposed change does not affect the design bases, accident analysis, reliability or capability of the SDGs
to perform their intended safety function, this change does not involve any reduction in a margin to safety.

1. Operation of Donald C. Cook Nuclear Plant Unit 1 in accordance with the proposed license amendment does not involve
a significant increase in the probability or consequences of an accident previously evaluated.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Testing of model boiler specimens for free span tubing (no TSP restraint) at room temperature conditions shows burst
pressures in excess of 5000 psi for indications of ODSCC with voltage measurements as high as 19 volts. Burst testing
performed on pulled tubes from Cook Nuclear Plant Unit 1 with up to a 2.02 volt indication shows measured burst in excess
of 10,000 psi at room temperature. Correcting for the effects of temperature on material properties and minimum strength
levels (as the burst testing was done at room temperature), tube burst capability significantly exceeds the RG 1.121
criterion requiring the maintenance of a margin of 3 times normal operating pressure differential on tube burst.
The 3 times normal operating pressure differential for the Cook Nuclear Plant Unit 1 steam generators corresponds
to 4275 psi. Based on the existing data base, this criterion is satisfied with 7/8
<!-- PJG 0020 minuteslatlong -->
&rsquo;
<!-- PJG 0020 minuteslatlong -->
&rsquo; diameter tubing with bobbin coil indications with signal amplitudes less than 4.9 volts, regardless of the
indicated depth measurement. A 1.0 volt plugging criteria compares favorably with the structural limit considering
the previously calculated growth rates for ODSCC within the Cook Nuclear Plant Unit 1 steam generators. Considering
a voltage increase of 0.4 volts, and adding a 20% NDE uncertainty of 0.20 volts (90% Cumulative Probability) to the
IPC of 1.0 volts results in an EOC voltage of approximately 1.6 volts for Cycle 14 operation. A 3.3 volt safety margins
implied (4.9 structural limit - 1.6 volt EOC - 3.3 volt margin). This EOC voltage compares favorably with the Structural
Limit of 4.9 volts.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
For the voltage/burst correlation, the EOC structural limit is supported by a voltage of 4.9 volts. A 3.1 volt BOC repair
limit confirms the structural limit when 40% growth and 20% uncertainty are applied to the repair limit. This repair
limit will be applied for Cycle 14 IPC implementation to repair bobbin indication greater than 3.1 volts independent
of RPC confirmation of the indication. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The conservatism of this repair limit is shown by the EOC 12 (Summer 1992) eddy current data. The overall average voltage
growth was determined to be only 2.2%, with a 12% average voltage growth for indications less than 0.75 volt BOC and
a 1% average voltage growth for indication >0.75 volt at the BOC. In addition, the Cycle 12 maximum observed voltage
increase was found to be 0.49 volts, and occurred in a tube initially &lt;1.0 BOC. In accordance with the technical
specification requirements, the applicability of Cycle 13 growth rates for Cycle 14 operation will be confirmed
prior to return to power of Cook Nuclear Plant Unit 1. Similar large structural margins are anticipated.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
As stated previously, TSP proximity to the tubes will prevent tube burst during all plant conditions. Test data indicates
that tube burst cannot occur within the TSP, even for tubes which have 100% through-wall EDM notches, 0.75 inch long,
provided that the TSP is adjacent to the notched area. Therefore, a more realistic assessment of tube operability
should be performed against the RG 1.121 loading requirements during accidents SLB conditions, since the TSP has
the potential to deflect during blowdown following a main SLB, thereby uncovering the intersection. At the ASME Code
recommended faulted condition loading of 3657 psi (2560 psi/0.7) structural integrity is provided for bobbin voltage
indications of a minimum of 9.6 volts. The repair limit based on the structural limited conservative SLB conditions
would be 6.0 volts (compared to a 3.1 volt repair limit for a structural limit based on the 3[delta]P burst capability
voltage).
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Only three indications of ODSCC have been reported to have operating leakage, and all three have been in European plants.
No field leakage has been reported at other plants from tubes with indications of a voltage level of under 7.7 volts
(from 3/4'' tubing). Relative to the expected leakage during accident condition loadings, it has been previously
established that a postulated main SLB outside of containment but upstream of the MSIV represents the most limiting
radiological condition relative to the IPC. In support of implementation of the IPC, it will be determined whether
the distribution of cracking indications at the TSP intersections at the EOC 14 are projected to be such that primary
to secondary leakage would result in site boundary doses within a small fraction of the 10 CFR 100 guidelines. The SLB
leakage rate calculation methodology prescribed in Section 3.3 of draft NUREG-1477 will be used to calculate EOC
14 leakage. Due to the relatively low voltage growth rates at Cook Nuclear Plant Unit 1 and the relatively small number
of indications affected by the IPC, SLB leakage prediction per draft NUREG-1477 is expected to be less than the acceptance
limit of 1.0 gpm in the faulted loop and far below the conservatively calculated SRP based allowable value of 120 gpm
in the faulted loop. The NRC leakage rate calculation methodology applies a 98% confidence limit on leakage that is
independent of voltage. This method for calculating SLB leakage is conservative as it assumes no correlations exists
between SLB leakage and bobbin probe voltage. Tube pull results from Cook Nuclear Plant Unit 1 indicate that tube wall
degradation of greater than 40% through-wall was detectable either by the bobbin or RPC probe. The tube with maximum
through-wall penetration of 56% (42% average) had a voltage of 2.02 volts. This indication also was the largest recorded
bobbin voltage from the EOC 12 eddy current data. All burst tested tube intersections had degradation depths of 40%
to 56 % (actual) deep and all were detected by both probes, with all bobbin voltage grater than or equal to 1.0. Since
the criteria requires the plugging of >1.0 volt bobbin indications with confirmed RPC calls, using the Cook Nuclear
Plant Unit 1 pulled tube destructive examination results, it is reasonable that no indications of degradation greater
than 40% to 56% deep with an ability to influence tube burst capability were left in service. Since the majority of the
EOC 14 indications at Cook Nuclear Unit 1 are expected to be below this level, the inclusion of all IPC intersections
into the leakage calculation is exceptionally conservative.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Therefore, as re-implementation of the 1.0 volt IPC during Cycle 14 does not adversely affect steam generator tube
integrity and results in acceptable dose consequences, the proposed amendment does not result in any increase in
the probability or consequences of an accident previously evaluated within the Cook Nuclear Plant Unit 1 FSAR.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
2. The proposed license amendment does not create the possibility of a new or different kind of accident from any accident
previously evaluated.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Implementation of the proposed steam generator tube IPC does not introduce any significant changes to the plant design
basis. Use of the criteria does not provide a mechanism which could result in a tube rupture outside of the region of
the TSP elevations; no ODSCC is occurring outside the thickness of the TSPs. Neither a single or multiple tube rupture
event would be expected in a steam generator in which the plugging criteria has been applied (during all plant conditions).
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Specifically, Cook Nuclear Plant will continue to implement a maximum leakage rate limit of 150 gpd (0.1 gpm) per steam
generator to help preclude the potential for excessive leakage during all plant conditions. The Cycle 14 Technical
Specification limits on primary to secondary leakage at operating conditions is a maximum of 0.4 gpm (600 gpd) for
all steam generators, or, a maximum of 150 gpd for any one steam generator. The RG 1.121 criterion for establishing
operational leakage rate limits that require plant shutdown are based upon leaks-before-break consideration to
detect a free span crack before potential tube rupture. The 150 gpd limit should provide for leakage detection and
plant shutdown in the event of the occurrence of an unexpected single crack resulting in leakage that is associated
with the longest permissible crack length. RG 1.121 acceptance criteria for establishing operating leakage limits
are based on leak-before-break considerations such that plant shutdown is initiated if the leakage associated with
the longest permissible crack is exceeded. The longest permissible crack is the length that provides a safety factor
of 3 against bursting at normal operating pressure differential. A voltage amplitude of 4.9 volts for typical ODSCC
corresponds to meeting this tube burst requirement at a lower 95% prediction limit on the burst correlation coupled
with 95/95 LTL material properties. Alternate crack morphologies can correspond to 4.9 volts so that a unique crack
length is not defied by the burst pressure versus voltage correlation. Consequently, typical burst pressure versus
through-wall crack length correlations are used below to define the ``longest permissible crack'' for evaluating
operating leakage limits.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
At current plant conditions, the single through-wall crack lengths that result in tube burst at 3 times normal operating
pressure differential and SLB conditions are 0.44 inch and 0.84 inch, respectively. A leak rate of 150 gpd will provide
for detection of 0.42 inch long cracks at nominal leak rates and 0.61 inch long cracks at the lower 95% confidence level
leak rates. Since tube burst is precluded during normal operation due to the proximity of the TSP to the tube and the
potential for the crevice to become uncovered during SLB conditions, the leakage from the maximum permissible crack
must preclude tube burst at SLB conditions. Thus, the 150 gpd limit provides for plant shutdown prior to reaching critical
crack lengths for SLB conditions.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
3. The proposed license amendment does not involve a significant reduction in margin of safety.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The use of the voltage based bobbin probe interim TSP elevation plugging criteria at Cook Nuclear Plant Unit 1 is demonstrated
to maintain steam generator tube integrity commensurate with the criteria of Regulatory Guide 1.121. RG 1.121 describes
a method acceptable to the NRC staff for meeting GDCs 14, 15, 31, and 32 by reducing the probability or the consequences
of steam generator tube rupture. This is accomplished by determining the limiting conditions of degradation of steam
generator tubing, as established by inservice inspection, for which tubes with unacceptable cracking should be
removed from service. Upon implementation of the criteria, even under the worst case conditions, the occurrence
of ODSCC at the TSP elevations is not expected to lead to a steam generator tube rupture event during normal or faulted
plant conditions. The EOC 14 distribution of crack indications at the TSP elevations will be confirmed to result in
acceptable primary to secondary leakage during all plant conditions and that radiological consequences are not
adversely impacted.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In addressing the combined effects of LOCA + SSE on the steam generator component (as required by GDC 2), it has been
determined that tube collapse may occur in the steam generators at some plants. This is the case as the TSPs may become
deformed as a result of lateral loads at the wedge supports at the periphery of the plant due to the combined effects
of the LOCA rarefaction wave and SSE loadings. Then, the resulting pressure differential on the deformed tubes may
cause some of the tubes to collapse.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
There are two issues associated with steam generator tube collapse. First, the collapse of steam generator tubing
reduces the RCS flow area through the tubes. The reduction in flow are increases the resistance to flow of steam from
the core during a LOCA which, in turn, may potentially increase peak clad temperature (PCT). Second, there is a potential
that partial through-wall cracks in tubes could progress to through-wall cracks during tube deformation or collapse.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Consequently, since the leak-before-break methodology is applicable to the Cook Nuclear Plant Unit 1 reactor coolant
loop piping, the probability of breaks in the primary loop piping is sufficiently low that they need not be considered
in the structural design of the plant. The limiting LOCA event becomes either the accumulator line brake or the pressurizer
surge line break. LOCA loads for the primary pipe breaks were used to bound the Cook Nuclear Plant Unit 1 smaller breaks.
The results of the analysis using the larger break inputs show that the LOCA loads were found to be of insufficient magnitude
to result in steam generator tube collapse or significant deformation.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Addressing RG 1.83 consideration, implementation of the bobbin probe voltage based interim tube plugging criteria
of 1.0 volt is supplemented by the following: enhanced eddy current inspection guidelines to proved consistency
in voltage normalization, a 100% eddy current inspection sample size at the TSP elevations, and RPC inspection requirements
as outlined in the technical specifications and Appendix A ``NDE Data Acquisition and Analysis Guidelines'' (Attachment
6). 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
As noted previously, implementation of the TSP elevation plugging criteria will decrease the number of tubes which
must be repaired. The installation of steam generator tube plugs reduce the RCS flow margin. Thus, implementation
of the alternate plugging criteria will maintain the margin of flow that would otherwise be reduced in the event of
increased tube plugging.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Based on the above, it is concluded that the proposed license amendment request does not result in a significant reduction
in margin with respect to plant safety as defined in the Final Safety Analysis Report or any of the plant Technical Specifications.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The proposed amendments delete certain Limiting Conditions for Operation, Actions, and Surveillance Requirements
for Reactor Coolant System Pressure Isolation Valves in the Technical Specifications. The Technical Specifications
for these Reactor Coolant System Pressure Isolation Valves were added by Order dated April 20, 1981. This Order was
prompted by concerns for an interfacing system loss-of-coolant accident as identified in the Reactor Safety Study
(WASH-1400). The proposed Technical Specification change, by inference, also requests rescission of the April
20, 1981 Order.

As required by 10 CFR 50.91(a), the licensee has provided its analysis of the issue of no significant hazards consideration,
which is presented below:
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->
Per 10 CFR 50.92, a proposed amendment to an operating license will not involve a significant hazards consideration
if the proposed amendment satisfies the following three criteria:
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
1. Does not involve a significant increase in the probability or consequences of an accident previously analyzed,
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
2. Does not create the possibility of a new or different kind of accident from an accident previously analyzed or evaluated,
or
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
3. Does not involve a significant reduction in a margin of safety.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=3 -->
Criterion 1
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The ISLOCA is not one of the accidents previously analyzed in Chapter 14, Safety Analysis, of the Cook Nuclear Plant
Updated Final Safety Analysis Report. Chapter 14 analyzes the large break LOCA in Section 14.3.1, and ``loss of reactor
coolant from small ruptured pipes or from cracks in large pipes which actuates the ECCS'', or small break LOCA in Section
14.3.2. Therefore, deleting from the Technical Specifications the Reactor Coolant System pressure isolation valves
in Table 3.4-0, will not increase the probability or the consequences of the large break or the small break LOCAs previously
analyzed for the Cook Nuclear Plant.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Criterion 2
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Reactor Coolant System pressure isolation valves in Table 3.4-0 of the Technical Specifications were added because
WASH-1400 identified the ISLOCA as a significant contributor to core damage frequency. Deletion of the subject valves
from the Technical Specifications and reliance on the testing requirements mandated by the In-Service Testing Program
of ASME XI does not create the possibility of a new or different kind of accident from the large break or the small break
LOCAs previously analyzed for the Cook Nuclear Plant.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Criterion 3
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Deleting the Reactor Coolant System pressure isolation valves from the testing requirements in Table 3.4-0 of the
Technical Specifications will result in these valves only being tested on a refueling outage frequency as part of
the ASME B&amp;PV Code Section XI IST Program. This somewhat reduced testing frequency will result in a slight increase
in the ISLOCA contribution to core damage frequency of 5.4%, from lower 5.00E-08/reactor year to mid 5.00E-08/reactor
year. This insignificant increase will not affect the overall core damage frequency of 6.26E-05/reactor year. Therefore,
it is concluded that the proposed deletion of the Reactor Coolant System pressure isolation valves in Table 3.4-0
of the Technical Specifications, as well as the proposed deletion of the portions of the Technical Specifications
that are affected by Table 3.4-0, will not result in a significant reduction in the margin of safety that exists at Cook
Nuclear Plant to prevent an ISLOCA or to mitigate the consequences of an ISLOCA.

Basis for proposed no significant hazards consideration determination: 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
As required by 10 CFR 50.91(a), the licensee has provided its analysis of the issue of no significant hazards consideration,
which is presented below:
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->
a. Does the change involve a significant increase in the probability or consequences of an accident previously evaluated?
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
A change to the defined restricted area has no affect on any plant operating parameters. Consequently, a change to
the defined restricted area will not affect the probability or consequences of an accident occurring.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Therefore, the proposed change does not involve a significant increase in the probability or consequences of an accident
previously evaluated. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
b. Does the change create the possibility of a new or different kind of accident from any accident previously evaluated?
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The proposed revisions to the HBPP TS are administrative in nature. Further, the proposed changes would not result
in any physical alteration to any plant system, and there would not be a change in the method by which any safety-related
system performs its function.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Therefore, the proposed change does not create the possibility of a new or different kind of accident from any accident
previously evaluated.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
c. Does the change involve a significant reduction in a margin of safety?
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The proposed revisions to the HBPP TS do not affect the margin of safety of any accident analysis since they do not affect
the parameters for any accident analysis, and have no effect on the current operating methodologies or actions which
govern plant performance.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

As required by 10 CFR 50.91(a), the licensee has provided its analysis of the issue of no significant hazards consideration,
which is presented below:
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->
1. The proposed Technical Specification (TS) changes do not involve a significant increase in the probability or
consequences of an accident previously evaluated. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The proposed TS changes involve eliminating the Main Steam Line Radiation Monitoring (MSLRM) system high radiation
trip function for initiating an automatic reactor scram and automatic closure of the Main Steam Line Isolation Valves
(MSIVs), Main Steam line drain valves, and Main Steam and Reactor Water sample line valves. The proposed TS changes
support installation of a plant modification to defeat portions of MSLRM system high radiation trip function logic
circuitry in the Reactor Protection System (RPS) and Primary Containment and Reactor Vessel Isolation Control System
(PCRVICS). Installation of this modification will not adversely impact the operation of the RPS or PCRVICS with respect
to performing its other intended safety functions. The proposed TS changes will not affect the operation of other
plant systems or equipment important to safety. The MSLRM system high radiation trip function for the Mechanical
Vacuum Pump (MVP) will be retained. The safety assessment and justification for eliminating the MSLRM system high
radiation trip function for initiating an automatic reactor scram and automatic closure of the MSIVs [are] based
on General Electric's (GE's) Topical Report NEDO-31400A, ``Safety Evaluation for Eliminating the Boiling Water
Reactor Main Steam Line Isolation Valve Closure Function and Scram Function of the Main Steam Line Radiation Monitor,''
and the applicability of this report to Limerick Generating Station (LGS), Units 1 and 2. By letter dated May 15, 1991,
the NRC approved this topical report and indicated that it was acceptable for licensees to reference this report as
the basis for requesting a TS change to eliminate the MSLRM system high radiation trip functions as documented in the
report and associated NRC Safety Evaluation Report (SER). 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The safety assessment provided in NEDO-31400A can also be applied to eliminate the MSLRM system high radiation trip
function for initiating the automatic closure of the Main Steam line drain valves although this aspect was not explicitly
evaluated in NEDO-31400A. The flow from these valves ultimately discharges to the main condenser as do the MSIVs and
therefore, any radioactive material passing through these valves would be processed in the same fashion as that passing
through the MSIVs. The effects of eliminating the MSLRM system high radiation trip function for initiating the closure
of the Main Steam and Reactor Water sample line valves is [are] negligible. The sample lines are routed to a sample sink
where inlet valves installed on the sample lines are normally closed. Additionally, downstream of the inlet valves
are needle valves designed to control and limit sample line flow. The sample sink is enclosed, and air vented from its
exhaust hood is passed through filters prior to release to the environment. There is the potential that a minimal amount
of radioactive material could be released to the environment if the sample sink inlet and needle valves failed to properly
function. This potential release has been evaluated and determined to a small fraction of the dose limit requirements
specified in 10 CFR 100.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The MSLRM system high radiation trip was intended to function in response to a Control Rod Drop Accident (CRDA), a Design
Basis Accident previously evaluated. Although the CRDA assumes MSIV closure, no credit was taken for this in the CRDA
analysis since it postulates that the radioactive material calculated to be released from the fuel is transported
to the main condenser prior to the MSIVs completely closing. Furthermore, the probability of a fuel failure is independent
of the operation of the MSLRM system.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Steam Jet Air Ejectors (SJAEs) will continue to operate to remove non-condensable gases from the main condenser
for processing by the Offgas Treatment system. The Offgas Treatment system will continue to function as designed
to reduce offgas radioactivity levels prior to release to the environment. Eliminating the MSLRM system high radiation
isolation functions will improve operational flexibility in that the main condenser will be available to aid in decay
heat removal. Elimination of the MSLRM system high radiation trip functions in conjunction with proper operation
of the Offgas Treatment system will ensure that any radioactive material released to the environment is a small fraction
of 10 CFR 100 limits.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Therefore, the proposed TS changes associated with eliminating the MSLRM system high radiation trip function for
initiating an automatic reactor scram and automatic closure of the MSIVs, Main Steam line drain valves, and Main Steam
and Reactor Water sample line valves do not involve an increase in the probability or consequences of an accident previously
evaluated.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
2. The proposed TS changes do not create the possibility of a new or different kind of accident from any accident previously
evaluated.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The proposed TS changes involve eliminating the MSLRM system high radiation trip function for initiating an automatic
reactor scram and automatic closure of the MSIVs, Main Steam Line drain valves, and Main Steam and Reactor Water sample
line valves. The proposed TS changes will not affect the operation of other plant systems or equipment important to
safety. The associated plant modification simply defeats the MSLRM system high radiation trip function logic circuitry
in the RPS and PCRVICS. The RPS and PCRVICS will continue to respond in performing its other design intended safety
functions. The MSLRM system high radiation trip function for the MVP will be retained. The proposed TS changes do not
involve any plant hardware changes that could introduce any new failure modes or effects. The MSLRM system radiation
monitors will remain active to initiate Main Control Room (MCR) annunciation alarms. Plant procedures will be in
place to implement the appropriate mitigative measures in response to a MSLRM system high radiation alarm signal.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The SJAEs will continue to operate to remove non-condensable gases from the main condenser for processing by the Offgas
Treatment system. The Offgas Treatment system will continue to function as designed to reduce offgas radioactivity
levels prior to release to the environment.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Since the Design Basis Accident analysis (i.e., CRDA) does not credit the MSLRM system high radiation trip function
for reducing the radiological consequences of the postulated accident, the proposed TS changes have effectively
been evaluated and are included in the existing analysis. That is, the CRDA analysis already assumes that the radioactive
material released from the failed fuel is immediately transported to the main condenser prior to the MSIVs completely
closing.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The safety assessment and assumptions documents in GE Topical Report NEDO-31400A provide the basis for eliminating
the MSLRM system high radiation trip function for initiating an automatic reactor scram and automatic closure of
the MSIVs. The safety assessment provided in NEDO-31400A can also be applied to eliminate the MSLRM system high radiation
trip function for initiating the closure of the Main Steam Line drain valves, since any radioactive material passing
through these valves would be processed in the same fashion as that passing through the MSIVs. Eliminating the MSLRM
system high radiation trip function for initiating the closure of the Main Steam and Reactor Water sample line valves
will have a negligible impact. The sample lines are routed to a sample sink where inlet valves installed on the sample
lines are normally closed. Downstream of the inlet valves are needle valves designed to control and limit sample line
flow. The sample sink is located in the Reactor Enclosure and is enclosed, and air vented from its exhaust hood is passed
through filters prior to release to the environment. The Reactor Enclosure ventilation duct radiation monitor samples
air from the sample sink hood exhaust, and will isolate the Reactor Enclosure ventilation system if the radiation
levels exceed the monitor's setpoint. There is the potential that a minimal amount of radioactive material could
be released to the environment through this flowpath if the sample sink inlet and needle valves failed to properly
function. This potential release has been evaluated and determined to a small fraction of the dose limit requirements
specified in 10CFR100.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Therefore, the proposed TS changes do not create the possibility of a new or different kind of accident previously
evaluated.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
3. The proposed TS changes do not involve a significant reduction in a margin of safety.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The proposed TS changes to eliminate the MSLRM system high radiation trip function for initiating an automatic reactor
scram and automatic closure of the MSIVs, Main Steam line drains valves, and Main Steam and Reactor Water sample line
valves do not change the conclusion reached in the LGS Updated Final Safety Analysis Report (UFSAR) that the calculated
radiological consequences of the bounding Design Basis Accident (i.e., CRDA) will not exceed the dose limit requirements
established by 10 CFR 100. The proposed TS changes will improve the overall reliability of the plant when compared
to the existing system lineup configuration, since it will reduce the potential of an unnecessary plant transient
occurring as a result of an inadvertent MSIV closure. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
A reliability assessment analysis was performed to evaluate the effects of eliminating the MSLRM system high radiation
reactor scram function on reactivity control failure frequency and core damage frequency in GE Topical Report NEDO-31400A.
This analysis indicated that there is a negligible increase in reactivity control frequency with the elimination
of the MSLRM trip function. However, this increase is compensated for by the reduction in transient initiating events
(i.e., inadvertent reactor scrams). This reduction in transient initiating events represents a reduction in core
damage frequency and thus, results in a net improvement in safety.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Therefore, the proposed TS changes do not involve a reduction in a margin of safety.

considered. The accident which is potentially negatively impacted by the proposed TS changes are any Loss of Coolant
Accident (LOCA) inside primary containment with or without offsite power available. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The proposed TS changes increase the surveillance interval of the drywell-to-suppression chamber bypass leak test
required by TS Section 4.6.2.1.d, and will require that an additional test be performed on the downcomer vacuum breakers
assemblies. The primary containment structure and associated equipment are not considered to be accident initiators,
they act to mitigate the consequences of an accident. There are no physical or operational changes being made as a result
of these proposed changes. Therefore, the probability of occurrence of an accident previously evaluated is not increased.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
There is a potential increased risk that an increase in the bypass leakage may go undetected for the duration of the
proposed extension of the interval between the performance of the drywell-to-suppression chamber bypass leak test.
However, as discussed below, the increased risk is considered to be negligible due to the design of the diaphragm structure
and past test data. Therefore, we have concluded that the probability of bypass leakage exceeding the allowed value
is not increased as a result of the proposed TS changes. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The proposed TS changes will extend the surveillance interval for the drywell-to-suppression chamber bypass leak
test from 18 months to 40 +/^ 10 months. These proposed changes would allow this test to be performed at the same interval
as the 10CFR50, Appendix J, Type A test (i.e., Containment Integrated Leakage Rate Test (CILRT)). In addition, the
proposed changes will add an additional surveillance requirement to be performed on the vacuum breaker assemblies
during refueling outages when the drywell-to-suppression chamber bypass leak test is not required to be performed.
The proposed TS changes do not increase the consequences of an accident previously evaluated. This is based on the
evaluation summarized below that demonstrates that the overall impact, if any, on the plant containment integrity
is negligible. Furthermore, the performance history for the previous LGS bypass leak tests does not indicate any
time based failures. The proposed TS changes also include a change to the frequency of testing, if two consecutive
tests fail, from once every nine (9) months to once every 24 months in order to coincide with the 24 month refueling cycle.
This change has no impact on the consequences of an accident based on maintaining the original requirement to increase
the frequency of testing if two consecutive bypass leak tests fail, and maintaining a TS requirement for the NRC to
review the schedule for subsequent tests.

During a LOCA inside containment, potential leak paths between the drywell and suppression chamber airspace could
result in excessive containment pressures, since the steam flow into the airspace would bypass the heat sink capabilities
of the suppression pool. The containment pressure response to the postulated bypass leakage can be mitigated by manually
actuating the suppression chamber sprays. Accordingly, since the sprays are manually actuated, an analysis was
performed to show that the operator has sufficient time to initiate the sprays prior to exceeding the containment
design pressure. This analysis is described in section 6.2.1.1.5 of the LGS Updated Final Safety Analysis Report
(UFSAR). The analysis is based on a small break LOCA inside containment with a differential pressure between the drywell-to-suppression
chamber equal to the static pressure due to downcomer submergence. The analysis concludes that the containment design
pressure of 55 psig will be reached in over 30 minutes from the onset of a small break LOCA assuming a drywell-to-suppression
chamber bypass flow area (i.e., A/square root of k) equal to 7.20 in
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=5 f=1 -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->
 without operator intervention.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
TS Limiting Condition for Operation 3.6.2.1.b conservatively specifies a maximum allowable bypass area of 10 % of
the design value of 7.20 in
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=5 f=1 -->
2
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->
. This TS limit provides an additional safety factor of 10 above the conservatism taken in the steam bypass analysis
(i.e., 0.720 in
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=5 f=1 -->
2
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->
). The drywell-to-suppression chamber bypass leak test required by TS Surveillance Requirement 4.6.2.1.d verifies
that the actual bypass flow area is less than or equal to the TS limit of 0.720 in
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=5 f=1 -->
2
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->
. The bypass leakage test ensures that degradation in the measured bypass area is identified and corrected to ensure
containment integrity during LOCA events.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The potential bypass leakage paths can be divided into two categories as described below.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
1) Leakage pathways other than those associated with the drywell-to-suppression chamber vacuum breaker assemblies
such as diaphragm floor penetrations (i.e., downcomer and Safety/Relief Valve (SRV) discharge line penetrations),
cracks in the diaphragm floor and/or liner plate, and cracks in the downcomers and SRV discharge lines that pass through
the suppression chamber airspace.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
2) The four sets of drywell-to-suppression chamber vacuum breaker assemblies.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
All other potential bypass leakage pathways have at least two isolation valves in the potential leakage path. These
valves are high quality leak-tight containment isolation valves that are normally closed and receive an isolation
signal to close. All Air Operated Valves (AOVs) in these paths fail closed.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Several plant design features and the bypass leak test data measured to date confirm that the leakage from other than
the vacuum breaker assemblies is negligible and indicates that this leakage will continue to be negligible for the
proposed increased duration between tests. All pressure boundary penetrations between the drywell and the suppression
chamber are welded except the vacuum breaker valves and the blind flanges closing 10 spare nozzles in the downcomers.
All pressure boundary penetrations between the drywell-to-suppression chamber have been fabricated, erected,
and inspected in accordance with the American Society of Mechanical Engineers (ASME) Code, Section III, Subsection
NC, 1971 Edition, with the exception of the tees supporting the vacuum breakers. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The downcomer and SRV discharge lines penetrate through the diaphragm slab and terminate in the suppression pool.
A steel ring plate is welded to the outside of the downcomers. The downcomer/ring plate assemblies are embedded in
the diaphragm slab with the top surface of the ring plate flush with the drywell side of the diaphragm slab. All connections
are welded to form a continuous steel membrane between the liner plate and downcomer penetrations. The SRV discharge
lines are routed through welded flued heads at the diaphragm floor. The flued head design and construction are similar
to the downcomer penetrations and also provide a continuous steel barrier. The downcomer and SRV discharge lines
are designed and constructed to safety-related requirements. In addition, they are designed for all postulated
loading conditions, including seismic, hydrodynamic, pressure, and temperature loads. The conservative design
requirements ensure that the SRV discharge and the downcomer lines will not contribute to bypass leakage.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The diaphragm floor is a reinforced concrete slab approximately 3.5 feet thick. The drywell side surface of the diaphragm
slab is capped with a 1/4 inch thick carbon steel liner plate. The liner plate and diaphragm slab provide a barrier against
the potential for bypass leakage through the diaphragm floor. The structural integrity of the diaphragm floor and
penetrations was demonstrated during the pre-operational test program. The drywell was pressurized to a drywell-to-suppression
chamber differential pressure of above 30 psid, which envelopes the maximum drywell-to-suppression chamber differential
pressure postulated to occur during LOCA conditions.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
There have been six Unit 1 and three Unit 2 bypass leak tests performed in accordance with TS Surveillance Requirement
4.6.2.1.d. These tests were conducted at a drywell-to-suppression chamber differential pressure of at least 4.0
psid. The measured leakage area includes leakage from both the vacuum breakers and sources other than vacuum breakers.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In all cases, the measured leakage is significantly less than the TS and design values. The maximum measured leakage
areas are 0.0400 in
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=5 f=1 -->
2
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->
 and 0.0111 in
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=5 f=1 -->
2
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->
 for Unit 1 and Unit 2, respectively; or 5.56% and 1.55 %, respectively, of the TS limit. The average values are 0.0180
in
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=5 f=1 -->
2
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->
 for Unit 1 and 0.0107 in
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=5 f=1 -->
2
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->
 for Unit 2; or 2.5% and 1.49%, respectively, of the TS limit of 0.720 in
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=5 f=1 -->
2
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->
. The minimum measured leakage areas are 0.0 in
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=5 f=1 -->
2
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->
 and 0.0100 in
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=5 f=1 -->
2
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->
 for Unit 1 and Unit 2, respectively, or 0% and 1.3 %, respectively, of the TS limit. Clearly, the test data confirm that
the bypass leakage measured to date at LGS has been negligible.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In addition, we have obtained bypass leakage data from the Pennsylvania Power and Light Company, Susquehanna Steam
Electric Station (SSES), Units 1 and 2, which also has Mark II containments with the Anderson Greenwood vacuum breakers
(i.e., the same manufacturer as the vacuum breakers installed in the LGS, Unit 1 and Unit 2 containments) and therefore
the data is applicable to LGS. The maximum bypass leakage area for the SSES Unit 1 containment was 0.037 in
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=5 f=1 -->
2
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->
, and 0.009 in
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=5 f=1 -->
2
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->
 for the SSES Unit 2 containment, or 4.81% and 1.17%, respectively, of the SSES TS limit. Approval for a similar TS change
for SSES, Units 1 and 2 was issued by the NRC by letter dated August 11, 1993. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The remaining and most likely source of potential bypass leakage is the four sets of drywell-to-suppression chamber
vacuum breakers. Each set consists of two vacuum breakers in series, flange mounted to a tee off the downcomers in the
suppression chamber airspace. The drywell-to-suppression chamber bypass leak test is currently required by TS
Surveillance requirement 4.6.2.1.d to be completed during each refueling outage and the results are used to verify
that the total bypass area, including that due to the vacuum breakers, meets the TS limit. If maintenance has been performed
on the vacuum breakers, this test also serves as a post-maintenance vacuum breakers leakage area test.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The proposed TS changes decrease the frequency of the drywell-to-suppression chamber bypass leak test. The drywell-to-suppression
chamber bypass leak test data obtained following vacuum breakers maintenance cannot be utilized to determine vacuum
breakers leakage reliability over the duration of the proposed test interval extension. To address this concern
and collect additional vacuum breakers leakage data, the proposed TS changes include an additional requirement
to perform a vacuum breaker leakage test as described below.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The leakage test will be conducted on each set of vacuum breakers (i.e., four vacuum breakers sets per unit) during
each refueling outage when the drywell-to-suppression chamber bypass leak test would not be required to be performed.
If maintenance is performed on the vacuum breaker assemblies, this additional test will be performed post-maintenance
to verify that the leakage is acceptable. This test will be conducted at a drywell-to-suppression chamber differential
pressure of 4.0 psid (i.e., the same as differential pressure required for the drywell-to-suppression chamber bypass
leak test) by either pressurizing the drywell side of the vacuum breakers or inducing a vacuum on the suppression chamber
side of the vacuum breakers. The acceptance criteria for the vacuum breaker leakage tests will be as follows. The total
vacuum breaker leakage areas for all four sets of vacuum breakers will be less than or equal to 24% of the TS limit (i.e.,
0.24 x 0.720 in
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=5 f=1 -->
2
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->
 = 0.173 in
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=5 f=1 -->
2
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->
). This proposed acceptable vacuum breaker leakage area provides a 76% margin to the TS limit to account for the leakage
paths other than the vacuum breakers. As described above, previous bypass leakage testing measured a maximum bypass
leakage area of 5.56% of the TS limit. The 76% margin is sufficiently large to accommodate the other expected leakage
sources. In addition, each set of vacuum breakers will be limited to a leakage area twice the assumed leakage from a
single vacuum breaker set, assuming the leakage area is evenly distributed among the four sets of vacuum breakers
(i.e., four sets equate to 24% of the TS Limit where each set is 6% and twice this total is 12% of the TS Limit). This allows
a leakage of less than or equal to 0.0865 in
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=5 f=1 -->
2
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->
 (i.e., (0.173 in
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=5 f=1 -->
2
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->
 divided by 4 sets of vacuum breakers) x (a factor of 2 times the acceptable total) = 0.0865 in
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=5 f=1 -->
2
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->
) for an individual set of vacuum breakers. This criterion is stipulated to identify individual sets of vacuum breakers
with higher leakage area. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The drywell-to-suppression chamber bypass leak test data obtained during previous testing at LGS demonstrates
conformance by a large margin compared to the TS and design leakage requirements. The test data indicates that there
is negligible risk that the bypass leakage will change adversely in future years. Furthermore, the proposed test
frequency is judged to be acceptable based on the risk of the leakage sources other than the vacuum breakers being essentially
equivalent to that of the rest of the primary containment structure, which is leak tested (i.e., CILRT) every 40 +/^
10 months as required by TS Surveillance Requirement 4.6.1.2.a. A bypass leak test will be developed and conducted
to verify acceptable vacuum breaker bypass leakage areas for those outages when the bypass leak test will not be required
to be performed. The proposed vacuum breaker leakage test with stringent acceptance criteria, combined with other
negligible leakage areas, provide an acceptable level of assurance that the bypass leakage can be measured and an
adverse condition can be detected and corrected such that the existing level of confidence that the primary containment
will function as required during a LOCA is maintained. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Therefore, the proposed TS changes will not involve an increase in the probability or consequences of an accident
previously evaluated.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
2. The proposed TS changes do not create the possibility of a new or different kind of accident from any accident previously
evaluated.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The proposed TS changes involve the drywell-to-suppression chamber bypass leak test frequency. There are no physical
or operational changes as a result of these proposed changes. These proposed changes include the requirement to perform
an additional surveillance test on the vacuum breaker assemblies, applying a differential pressure of 4.0 psid which
is the same differential pressure as currently required by TS for the drywell-to-suppression chamber bypass leak
test. This required test will ensure that acceptable vacuum breaker leakage is maintained during those intervals
when the drywell-to-suppression chamber bypass leak test is not required to be performed. Furthermore, the affected
structure (i.e., primary containment) acts as an accident mitigator and not as an accident initiator. Accordingly,
the possibility of a different type of malfunction of equipment or the possibility of an accident of a different type
is not introduced.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Therefore, the proposed TS changes do not create the possibility of a new or different kind of accident from any accident
previously evaluated.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
3. The proposed TS changes do not involve a significant reduction in a margin of safety.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The drywell-to-suppression chamber bypass leak test data obtained during previous testing at LGS demonstrates
conformance by a large margin to the TS and design leakage requirements. The test data indicate that there is negligible
risk that the bypass leakage will change adversely in future years. Furthermore, the proposed test frequency is judged
to be acceptable based on the risk of sources of leakage other than the vacuum breakers being essentially equivalent
to that of the rest of the primary containment structure, which is tested every 40 +/^ 10 months. A bypass leak test will
be developed and conducted to verify acceptable vacuum breaker bypass leakage areas for those outages when the bypass
leak test will not be required to be performed. The proposed vacuum breaker leakage test with stringent acceptance
criteria, combined with the other negligible potential leakage areas, provide an acceptable level of assurance
that the bypass leakage can be measured and an adverse condition can be detected and corrected such that the existing
levels of confidence that the primary containment will function as required during a LOCA is maintained. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Therefore, the consequences of an accident are not impacted by this change and containment integrity during a LOCA
will be maintained.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Therefore, the proposed TS changes do not involve a reduction in a margin of safety.

As required by 10 CFR 50.91(a), the licensee has provided its analysis of the issue of no significant hazards consideration,
which is presented below:
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->
1. The proposed change does not involve a significant increase in the probability or consequences of an accident previously
evaluated because implementation of the proposed TS change, which would delete the requirement to demonstrate the
operability of an otherwise operable EDG once the potential for a common cause failure has been dismissed, does not
affect the design or performance characteristics of an EDG. Similarly, deleting the requirement to demonstrate
the operability of EDGs when an offsite power source is inoperable does not affect the design or performance characteristics
of an EDG. Therefore, the EDGs will maintain their ability to perform their design function. The EDGs are not assumed
to be an initiator of any analyzed event. The role of the EDGs is the mitigation of accident consequences. Therefore,
this proposed TS change does not increase the probability of an accident previously evaluated. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The consequences of an accident previously evaluated could be affected by the proposed TS change. As described above,
implementation of the proposed change will result in the EDGs maintaining their ability to perform their design function.
Excessive testing of EDGs can cause reduced reliability. Precluding unnecessary testing of operable EDGs will improve
EDG reliability and thereby have an overall positive affect on plant safety. Therefore, this proposed TS change does
not increase the consequences of an accident previously evaluated.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
2. The proposed change does not create the possibility of a new or different kind of accident from any accident previously
evaluated because implementation of the proposed TS change will not involve physical changes to plant systems, structures,
or components (SSC). The design or performance characteristics of the EDG will not be affected by the proposed change.
The proposed change does not introduce any new modes of plant operation or make any changes to system setpoints which
would initiate a new or different kind of accident. Therefore, the possibility of a new or different kind of accident
from any accident previously evaluated is not created.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
3. The proposed change does not involve a significant reduction in a margin of safety because the proposed TS change
does not affect the design or performance of any EDG. The change will increase EDG reliability by reducing the stresses
on the EDG from unnecessary testing. This will result in an overall increase in plant safety. Therefore, the proposed
change does not involve a significant reduction in a margin of safety.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->
1. The proposed change does not involve a significant increase in the probability or consequences of an accident previously
evaluated because the proposed TS change is administrative in nature. The PORC member titles will be removed from
the TS to facilitate not requiring that a TS change be submitted for NRC approval when position titles change. PORC
member qualifications will continue to be consistent with those required for the Facility Staff and meet or exceed
Sections 4.2, 4.4, or 4.6 of ANSI N18.1-1971. The proposed change ensures that PORC will continue to be comprised of
personnel involved in daily plant activities who are experienced individuals with varied expertise. By maintaining
the qualification requirements for members of PORC who represent various areas of expertise, PORC will continue
to fulfill its requirements specified in TS Section 6.5.1.6. The proposed change does not involve any physical changes
to plant systems, structures, or components (SSC), or the manner in which these SSC are operated, maintained, modified,
tested, or inspected. Therefore, the proposed TS change does not involve a significant increase in the probability
or consequences of an accident previously evaluated.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
2. The proposed change does not create the possibility of a new or different kind of accident from any accident previously
evaluated because implementation of the proposed TS change will not involve physical changes to plant SSC or the manner
in which these SSC are operated, maintained, modified, tested or inspected. The proposed change does not introduce
any new modes of plant operation or make any changes to system setpoints which would initiate a new or different kind
of accident. Therefore, the possibility of a new or different kind of accident from any accident previously evaluated
is not created.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
3. The proposed change does not involve a significant reduction in a margin of safety because the proposed TS change
is administrative in nature by providing internal flexibility in changing organizational titles and does not reduce
the PORC function or responsibilities. PORC will continue to be filled by appropriately qualified personnel who
have a variety of expertise. The change does not affect the plant material condition, operation, or accident analyses.
Therefore, the proposed change does not involve a significant reduction in a margin of safety.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->
1. The proposed changes do not involve a significant increase in the probability or consequences of an accident previously
evaluated. The proposed changes are administrative in nature and do not involve any change to the configuration or
method of operation of any plant equipment used to mitigate the consequences of an accident. Also, the proposed changes
do not alter the conditions or assumptions in any of the FSAR accident analyses. Since the FSAR accident analyses remain
bounding, the radiological consequences previously evaluated are not adversely affected by the proposed changes.
Therefore, the proposed changes do not involve a significant increase in the probability or consequences of an accident
previously evaluated.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
2. The proposed changes do not create the possibility of a new or different kind of accident from any accident previously
evaluated. The proposed changes are administrative in nature and do not involve any change to the configuration or
method of operation of any plant equipment used to mitigate the consequences of an accident.Accordingly, no new failure
modes have been defined for any plant system or component important to safety nor has any new limiting failure been
identified as a result of the proposed changes. Therefore, the proposed changes do not create the possibility of a
new or different kind of accident from any accident previously evaluated.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
3. The proposed changes do not involve a significant reduction in a margin of safety. The proposed changes are administrative
in nature and will continue to ensure that the response times for the RTS and ESFAS instrumentation do not exceed the
limits assumed in the accident analyses. As a result of the proposed changes, response time limits for the RTS and ESFAS
will be administratively controlled in accordance with the provisions of 10 CFR 50.59, thus eliminating an unnecessary
burden of governmental regulation without reducing protection for public health and safety. Therefore, the proposed
changes do not involve a significant reduction in a margin of safety.

Description of amendment request: 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The proposed amendments provide an administrative vehicle for modifying a condition of the facility operating license
for each of the BFN units. The condition requires the licensee to implement and maintain in effect all provisions of
the ``Fire Protection Program (FPP)'' and lists the U.S. Nuclear Regulatory Commission (NRC) staff safety evaluations
(SE) approving the FPP. If the staff approves of a revision currently under review to an element of the FPP, the ``Appendix
R Safe Shutdown Program (SSP)'', the proposed amendments would add the staff SE documenting approval of the revised
SSP to the above listing of SEs in each facility operating license. The current SSP is directed toward the safe shutdown
of only one operating plant (Unit 2). The revised SSP would be directed toward the safe shutdown of two operating plants
(Units 2 and 3).
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Additionally, the proposed amendments add the definition of the SSP to Section 1.0 of the Unit 3 Technical Specifications

Description of amendment request:

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The proposed amendment would delete reference in the BFN Unit 3 Technical Specifications (TS) to the Reactor Water
Cleanup (RWCU) system floor drain high temperature switches and the RWCU system space high temperature switches.
The piping configuration for the Unit 3 RWCU system has been modified, and the licensee contends that its revised High
Energy Line Break (HELB) analysis has demonstrated that these switches are no longer required. Instead, to initiate
RWCU system isolation, the HELB analysis has indicated the need for temperature switches in the main steam vault,
the heat exchanger room, and the RWCU pipe trench. The proposed amendment therefore would add temperature switches
to the Unit 3 TS for these areas and modify the TS Bases section accordingly. The proposed amendment also adds clarifying
remarks to Tables 3.2.A and 3.2.B of the TS for each of the BFN units. The proposed remarks list the actuation signals
for the various primary containment valve group isolations.

Basis for proposed no significant hazards consideration determination: 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
As required by 10 CFR 50.91(a), the licensee has provided its analysis of the issue of no significant hazards consideration,
which is presented below:
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->
1. The proposed amendment does not involve a significant increase in the probability or consequences of any accident
previously evaluated.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
An analysis of HELBs in the Unit 3 reactor building identified certain RWCU pipe breaks which could not be automatically
detected and isolated in a reasonable time frame. To resolve this issue, a design change is being performed to remove
from service the existing non-environmentally qualified temperature switches used to detect RWCU line breaks and
replace them with environmentally qualified RTDs [resistance temperature detectors] and IEEE [Institute of Electrical
and Electronics Engineers] Class 1E qualified ATUs [analog trip units] located to detect and isolate the critical
RWCU pipe breaks. This TS amendment adds the new ATUs [sic] function to Tables 3.2.A and 4.2.A. Note 14 is deleted from
Table 3.2.A since it only applies to the temperature switches being removed from the table. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The safety function of the RTD/ATU temperature loops is to provide an isolation signal to close the RWCU suction line
isolation valves (FCV-69-001 and FCV-69-002) and RWCU return line valve (FCV-69-012) on a high area temperature.
This ensures RWCU pipe breaks are isolated. No other RWCU safety functions are affected by the change. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The new RTD/ATU temperature loops were chosen to decrease the time required to initiate closure of the RWCU valves.
This improves the detection/isolation of RWCU breaks and helps to limit the reactor coolant lost, helps ensure core
cooling, and helps ensure that environmental conditions inside the reactor building are maintained within the required
limits.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Components added by this change are qualified for the environment in which they will operate. This ensures that the
system will perform its function in a post accident environment. No additional paths for the release of radiation
or contamination are created. The failure modes of the RTDs and ATUs are such that any single failure will result in
a gross failure alarm and/or a channel trip. Because of the redundancy, separations, and logic designed into the system,
a single failure of any part of the system will not prevent isolation of the primary containment isolation valves and
spurious operation is minimized. The RTDs will be located and the instrument setpoints will be set to preclude spurious
trips due to ambient temperatures including localized hot areas while assuring a timely trip due to a pipe break. Therefore,
the proposed amendment does not involve a significant increase in the probability or consequences of any accident
previously evaluated.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
2. The proposed amendment does not create the possibility of a new or different kind of accident from any accident previously
evaluated.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
This change is being made to improve the RWCU leak detection/isolation function of the RWCU Primary Containment Isolation
System (PCIS). The PCIS will perform its intended safety function in the same manner as the previous installation.
There is no affect [sic] on the function or operation of any other plant system.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Failure of the RTD/ATU temperature loops would be no different than failure of existing temperature switches. Since
environmental qualification requirements, divisional separation, single failure requirements and one-out-of-two
taken twice logic requirements are maintained, the possibility of a RWCU isolation failure on a RWCU line break or
of a spurious isolation is no more likely after the change than before.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In the existing design, logic relays are powered from RPS Bus A or B. The new design also uses RPS Bus A or B to feed the ATUs.
Therefore, the consequence of a power failure is unchanged from the present design. The seismic qualification and
proper circuit coordination of the installation is maintained. The system functions and operates in the same manner
as previously evaluated in the Safety Analysis Report. No new system interactions other than additional RTDs located
in the main steam valve vault to input into the PCIS logic for isolation of the RWCU have been introduced by this activity.
Therefore, the proposed amendment does not create the possibility of a new or different kind of accident from any accident
previously evaluated.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
3. The proposed amendment does not involve a significant reduction in the margin of safety.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The margin of safety will be enhanced by installing instruments that provide quicker response to a temperature rise
indicative of a pipe break. Calculations have been performed to determine the analytical limits for the RTD/ATU temperature
loops in each of the monitored areas and to determine the setpoints for the ATUs in each area. The setpoints are set above
the maximum expected room temperatures to avoid spurious actuations due to ambient conditions and below the analytical
limits to ensure timely detection of a pipe break. This type of design utilizing ATUs has been analyzed by the NRC [U.S.
Nuclear Regulatory Commission staff] (NEDO-21617, Analog Transmitter/Trip Unit System for Engineered Safeguard
Sensor Trip Input) and has been found to be generically acceptable at BWR facilities. Therefore, the proposed amendment
does not involve a significant reduction in any margin of safety.

Description of amendment request:

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The proposed change would change the Technical Specifications (TS) for the North Anna Power Station, Units No. 1 and
No. 2 (NA-1&amp;2). 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Specifically, the proposed changes would modify the surveillance frequency of the Auxiliary Feedwater System pumps
from monthly to quarterly in accordance with the guidance provided in Generic Letter 93-05, ``Line-Item Technical
Specifications Improvements to Reduce Surveillance Requirements for Testing During Power Operation,'' dated
September 27, 1993.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The NRC has completed a comprehensive examination of surveillance requirements in TS that require testing at power.
The evaluation is documented in NUREG-1366, ``Improvements to Technical Specification Surveillance Requirements,''
dated December 1992. The NRC staff found, that while the majority of testing at power is important, safety can be improved,
equipment degradation decreased, and an unnecessary burden on personnel resources eliminated by reducing the amount
of testing at power that is required by TS. Based on the results of the evaluations documented in NUREG 1366, the NRC
issued Generic Letter 93-05. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Auxiliary Feedwater System supplies water to the steam generators to remove decay heat from the Reactor Coolant
System. To ensure operability of the Auxiliary Feedwater System, the pumps are currently tested on a monthly basis
as required by the TS. Consistent with Generic Letter 93-05, Item 9.1 and NUREG-1366, the licensee is requesting a
change to the surveillance testing frequency for the Auxiliary Feedwater Pumps from monthly to quarterly on a staggered
test basis.

which is presented below:
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->
Specifically, operation of North Anna Power Station in accordance with the proposed Technical Specifications changes
will not:
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
1. Involve a significant increase in the probability of occurrence or consequences of an accident previously evaluated.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Changing the surveillance test frequencies of the Auxiliary Feedwater System pumps does not significantly affect
the probability of occurrence or consequences of any previously evaluated accidents. Quarterly testing of the pumps
on a staggered basis will continue to assure that the Auxiliary Feedwater System will be capable of performing its
intended functions. Therefore, the change in frequency of testing the Auxiliary Feedwater System pumps does not
affect the probability or consequences of any previously analyzed accident.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->
Changing the surveillance test frequency of the Auxiliary Feedwater System pumps does not involve any physical modification
of the plant or result in a change in a method of operation. Quarterly testing of the Auxiliary Feedwater System pumps
on a staggered basis will continue to assure that the Auxiliary Feedwater System will be capable of performing its
intended function. Therefore, a new or different type of accident is not made possible.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
3. Involve a significant reduction in a margin of safety.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Changing the surveillance test frequency of the Auxiliary Feedwater System pumps does not affect any safety limits
or limiting safety system settings. System operating parameters are unaffected. The availability of equipment
required to mitigate or assess the consequence of an accident is not reduced. Quarterly testing of the Auxiliary Feedwater
System pumps on a staggered basis will continue to assure that the Auxiliary Feedwater System will be capable of performing
its intended functions. Safety margins are, therefore, not decreased.

minimum measured reactor coolant system (RCS) flow rate from 385,000 gallons per minute (gpm) to 382,000 gpm for Unit
1. Catawba Unit 2 values are unchanged and, accordingly, certain TS pages were modified to retain the current TS values
in effect for Unit 2. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The need for these changes is attributed to the effects of steam generator tube plugging and to a hot leg temperature
streaming phenomenon. The application also proposed to revise the text of TS 2.1.1 and the definition for TS Figure
2.1-1. These changes are not related to the changes in RCS flow rate. The staff is continuing to review these proposed
changes and, accordingly, they are not dealt with in this amendment.

These amendments increase the shutdown margin requirements for the current operating cycle at both units; reduce
the containment pressure high-high setpoint and allowable value; and change the containment spray system, containment
fan cooler and service water system response times. These changes were necessitated by the discovery of containment
fan cooler unit and containment spray system response times greater than originally assumed for Loss of Coolant Accident
(LOCA) or Main Steam Line Break (MSLB) analysis, and auxiliary feedwater system flow greater than assumed for the
MSLB analysis.

Notice of Issuance of Amendments to Facility Operating Licenses and Final Determination of No Significant Hazards
Consideration and Opportunity For a Hearing (Exigent Public Announcement or Emergency Circumstances)
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
During the period since publication of the last biweekly notice, the Commission has issued the following amendments.
The Commission has determined for each of these amendments that the application for the amendment complies with the
standards and requirements of the Atomic Energy Act of 1954, as amended (the Act), and the Commission's rules and regulations.
The Commission has made appropriate findings as required by the Act and the Commission's rules and regulations in
10 CFR Chapter I, which are set forth in the license amendment. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Because of exigent or emergency circumstances associated with the date the amendment was needed, there was not time
for the Commission to publish, for public comment before issuance, its usual 30-day Notice of Consideration of Issuance
of Amendment, Proposed No Significant Hazards Consideration Determination, and Opportunity for a Hearing. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
For exigent circumstances, the Commission has either issued a 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 -->
Federal Register 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
notice providing opportunity for public comment or has used local media to provide notice to the public in the area
surrounding a licensee's facility of the licensee's application and of the Commission's proposed determination
of no significant hazards consideration. The Commission has provided a reasonable opportunity for the public to
comment, using its best efforts to make available to the public means of communication for the public to respond quickly,
and in the case of telephone comments, the comments have been recorded or transcribed as appropriate and the licensee
has been informed of the public comments.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In circumstances where failure to act in a timely way would have resulted, for example, in derating or shutdown of a
nuclear power plant or in prevention of either resumption of operation or of increase in power output up to the plant's
licensed power level, the Commission may not have had an opportunity to provide for public comment on its no significant
hazards consideration determination. In such case, the license amendment has been issued without opportunity for
comment. If there has been some time for public comment but less than 30 days, the Commission may provide an opportunity
for public comment. If comments have been requested, it is so stated. In either event, the State has been consulted
by telephone whenever possible.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Under its regulations, the Commission may issue and make an amendment immediately effective, notwithstanding the
pendency before it of a request for a hearing from any person, in advance of the holding and completion of any required
hearing, where it has determined that no significant hazards consideration is involved. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Commission has applied the standards of 10 CFR 50.92 and has made a final determination that the amendment involves
no significant hazards consideration. The basis for this determination is contained in the documents related to
this action. Accordingly, the amendments have been issued and made effective as indicated. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Unless otherwise indicated, the Commission has determined that these amendments satisfy the criteria for categorical
exclusion in accordance with 10 CFR 51.22. Therefore, pursuant to 10 CFR 51.22(b), no environmental impact statement
or environmental assessment need be prepared for these amendments. If the Commission has prepared an environmental
assessment under the special circumstances provision in 10 CFR 51.12(b) and has made a determination based on that
assessment, it is so indicated.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
For further details with respect to the action see (1) the application for amendment, (2) the amendment to Facility
Operating License, and (3) the Commission's related letter, Safety Evaluation and/or Environmental Assessment,
as indicated. All of these items are available for public inspection at the Commission's Public Document Room, the
Gelman Building, 2120 L Street, NW., Washington, DC 20555, and at the local public document room for the particular
facility involved. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Commission is also offering an opportunity for a hearing with respect to the issuance of the amendment. By February
4, 1994, the licensee may file a request for a hearing with respect to issuance of the amendment to the subject facility
operating license and any person whose interest may be affected by this proceeding and who wishes to participate as
a party in the proceeding must file a written request for a hearing and a petition for leave to intervene. Requests for
a hearing and a petition for leave to intervene shall be filed in accordance with the Commission's ``Rules of Practice
for Domestic Licensing Proceedings'' in 10 CFR Part 2. Interested persons should consult a current copy of 10 CFR 2.714
which is available at the Commission's Public Document Room, the Gelman Building, 2120 L Street, NW., Washington,
DC 20555 and at the local public document room for the particular facility involved. If a request for a hearing or petition
for leave to intervene is filed by the above date, the Commission or an Atomic Safety and Licensing Board, designated
by the Commission or by the Chairman of the Atomic Safety and Licensing Board Panel, will rule on the request and/or
petition; and the Secretary or the designated Atomic Safety and Licensing Board will issue a notice of a hearing or
an appropriate order. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
As required by 10 CFR 2.714, a petition for leave to intervene shall set forth with particularity the interest of the
petitioner in the proceeding, and how that interest may be affected by the results of the proceeding. The petition
should specifically explain the reasons why intervention should be permitted with particular reference to the following
factors: (1) the nature of the petitioner's right under the Act to be made a party to the proceeding; (2) the nature and
extent of the petitioner's property, financial, or other interest in the proceeding; and (3) the possible effect
of any order which may be entered in the proceeding on the petitioner's interest. The petition should also identify
the specific aspect(s) of the subject matter of the proceeding as to which petitioner wishes to intervene. Any person
who has filed a petition for leave to intervene or who has been admitted as a party may amend the petition without requesting
leave of the Board up to 15 days prior to the first prehearing conference scheduled in the proceeding, but such an amended
petition must satisfy the specificity requirements described above. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Not later than 15 days prior to the first prehearing conference scheduled in the proceeding, a petitioner shall file
a supplement to the petition to intervene which must include a list of the contentions which are sought to be litigated
in the matter. Each contention must consist of a specific statement of the issue of law or fact to be raised or controverted.
In addition, the petitioner shall provide a brief explanation of the bases of the contention and a concise statement
of the alleged facts or expert opinion which support the contention and on which the petitioner intends to rely in proving
the contention at the hearing. The petitioner must also provide references to those specific sources and documents
of which the petitioner is aware and on which the petitioner intends to rely to establish those facts or expert opinion.
Petitioner must provide sufficient information to show that a genuine dispute exists with the applicant on a material
issue of law or fact. Contentions shall be limited to matters within the scope of the amendment under consideration.
The contention must be one which, if proven, would entitle the petitioner to relief. A petitioner who fails to file
such a supplement which satisfies these requirements with respect to at least one contention will not be permitted
to participate as a party. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Those permitted to intervene become parties to the proceeding, subject to any limitations in the order granting leave
to intervene, and have the opportunity to participate fully in the conduct of the hearing, including the opportunity
to present evidence and cross-examine witnesses. Since the Commission has made a final determination that the amendment
involves no significant hazards consideration, if a hearing is requested, it will not stay the effectiveness of the
amendment. Any hearing held would take place while the amendment is in effect. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
A request for a hearing or a petition for leave to intervene must be filed with the Secretary of the Commission, U.S.
Nuclear Regulatory Commission, Washington, DC 20555, Attention: Docketing and Services Branch, or may be delivered
to the Commission's Public Document Room, the Gelman Building, 2120 L Street, NW., Washington, DC 20555, by the above
date. Where petitions are filed during the last 10 days of the notice period, it is requested that the petitioner promptly
so inform the Commission by a toll-free telephone call to Western Union at 1-(800) 248-5100 (in Missouri 1-(800) 342-6700).
The Western Union operator should be given Datagram Identification Number N1023 and the following message addressed

Washington, DC 20555, and to the attorney for the licensee. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Nontimely filings of petitions for leave to intervene, amended petitions, supplemental petitions and/or requests
for a hearing will not be entertained absent a determination by the Commission, the presiding officer or the Atomic
Safety and Licensing Board that the petition and/or request should be granted based upon a balancing of the factors
specified in 10 CFR 2.714(a)(1)(i)-(v) and 2.714(d).

Brief description of amendment: 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The amendment changes the existing technical specifications (TS) by adding a footnote to TS 4.4.5.0 to address steam
generator (SG) operability requirements. The change references an unscheduled inspection of the 1C SG which occurred
due to a tube leak in that SG. The amendment was required because the circumstances of the inspection were not covered
by the existing TS 3/4.4.5. It will allow SG operability requirements to be satisfied until the next SG inservice inspection,
scheduled to begin no later than March 5, 1993.
