(a) The agency shall take appropriate steps to ensure effective communication with applicants, participants, personnel
of other Federal entities, and members of the public. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(1) The agency shall furnish appropriate auxiliary aids where necessary to afford an individual with disabilities
an equal opportunity to participate in, and enjoy the benefits of, a program or activity conducted by the agency. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(i) In determining what type of auxiliary aid is necessary, the agency shall give primary consideration to the requests
of the individual with disabilities. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(ii) The agency need not provide individually prescribed devices, readers for personal use or study, or other devices
of a personal nature. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(2) Where the agency communicates with applicants and beneficiaries or members of the public by telephone, telecommunication
devices for deaf persons (TDD's) or equally effective telecommunication systems shall be used to communicate with
persons with impaired hearing. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(b) The agency shall ensure that interested persons, including persons with impaired vision or hearing, can obtain

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

to a location at which they can obtain information about accessible facilities. The international symbol for accessibility

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(d) This section does not require the agency to take any action that it can demonstrate would result in a fundamental
alteration in the nature of a program or activity or in undue financial and administrative burdens. In those circumstances
where agency personnel believe that the proposed action would fundamentally alter the program or activity or would
result in undue financial and administrative burdens, the agency has the burden of proving that compliance with this
section would result in such alteration or burdens. The decision that compliance would result in such alteration
or burdens must be made by the Secretary or his or her designee after considering all agency resources available for
use in the funding and operation of the conducted program or activity and must be accompanied by a written statement
of the reasons for reaching that conclusion. If an action required to comply with 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
&sect;9.160 would result in such an alteration or such burdens, the agency shall take any other action that would not
result in such an alteration or such 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
burdens but would nevertheless ensure that, to the maximum extent possible, individuals with disabilities receive
the benefits and services of the program or activity.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

extend this time for good cause. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
