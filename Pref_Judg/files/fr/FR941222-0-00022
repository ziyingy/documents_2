The Certificate of Compliance requires that the fuel have no known or 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
suspected gross cladding breaches to ensure the structural integrity of the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
fuel. Known or suspected failed fuel assemblies (rods) and fuel with cladding 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
defects greater than pin holes and hairline cracks are not authorized in the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Standardized NUHOMS. Fuel meeting this specification will be safely stored 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
and will remain intact in storage because the dry inert atmosphere and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
relatively low temperature will prevent deterioration of the cladding. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Grossly breached fuel will be handled in site-specific license applications.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 Quite a few comments related to the structural stability 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
of the HSM, particularly its response to earthquakes. Commenters questioned 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the possibility of vertical storage of the Standardized NUHOMS and suggested 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
that it would be very difficult to restrain the HSM if the DSC were in a 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
vertical position. One commenter wanted dry storage casks constructed to 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Building Officials Code Administrators (BOCA) National Building Code (and Ohio 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Administrative Code) for structures in use group H&hyph;4, high hazard use, which 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
includes radioactive materials. Commenters questioned whether ground 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
acceleration as used by the NRC in its evaluation could adequately describe 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
all potential earthquakes east of the Rocky Mountain Front and suggested that 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
a ground acceleration of 2.5g would not be realistic for all sites, despite 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
proximity to fault lines. Another commenter alleged a number of seismic 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
events in the midwest which had some effect in the Ohio area could cause a 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
complete failure of the cask and requested that the NRC insist that the cask, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
containment structure, and foundation pad be designed to substantially exceed 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
all earthquakes with a potential for 0.60g. One commenter wanted to know if 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the module had been analyzed for earthquake events at all United States 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
reactor sites, according to Laurand Findmun Seismic Hazard Curves. Other 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
commenters expressed various concerns about the integrity and reaction of the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Standardized NUHOMS components under earthquake conditions and asked the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
following questions: 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Could the casks crash against each other as the ground moves beneath 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
them? 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Could the module shift, crack, or move off the pad? 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
How are the rail support holdings evaluated? 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Could the DSC be knocked off the rails? and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Could the module roof crack and fall on the canister? 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

Response.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 The Standardized NUHOMS design described in the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
vendor's applications for approval and the SAR does not address vertical 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
storage. Consequently, NRC neither evaluated nor approved vertical storage 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
for the system. Therefore, it may not be stored vertically. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The NRC reviewed the Standardized NUHOMS for compliance with design 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
criteria that are more stringent than those of the BOCA National Building Code 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(NBC) (see response to Comment A.5). These more stringent criteria are 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
included in national standards that more closely represent the use of the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Standardized NUHOMS. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Part 72 specifies a design basis maximum ground acceleration of 0.25g 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
for areas east of the Rocky Mountain Front that are not in areas of known 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
seismic activity. All HSMs and DSCs are designed to withstand a 0.25g 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
earthquake. Any reactor licensee who intends to use the Standardized NUHOMS 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
must verify that the maximum displacements at the cask's location on the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
reactor site are within the design criteria for the system. The Standardized 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
NUHOMS is free standing and not dependent on the pad for safety. Failure of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the pad caused by seismic events will not cause the Standardized NUHOMS to 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
fail. Therefore, cask safety does not require the pad to be designed to 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
withstand a seismic event.

 One commenter stated that the SAR did not include 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
consideration of the accident events such as: aircraft crashes, turbine 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
missiles, external fires, explosions, and sabotage.
