<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 -->
Risk assessment is an empirically based process used to estimate the risk that 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
exposure of an individual or population to a chemical, physical, or biological agent will be 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
associated with an adverse effect. Generally, such effects can be quantified and the relative 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
probability of their occurrence can be calculated. The risk assessment process usually 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
involves four steps: hazard identification, dose-response assessment, exposure assessment, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
and risk characterization (NRC, 1983). Risk management is the process that applies 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
information obtained through the risk assessment process to determine whether the assessed 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
risk should be reduced and, if so, to what extent (NRC, 1983). In some cases, risk is the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
only factor considered in a decision to regulate exposure to a substance. Alternatively, the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
risk posed by a substance is weighed against social, ethical, and medical benefits and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
economic and technological factors in formulating a risk management decision. The risk-
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
balancing approach is used by some agencies to consider the benefits as well as the risks 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
associated with unrestricted or partially restricted use of a substance. The purpose of this 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
chapter is to describe the risk assessment process as it has currently evolved in 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
neurotoxicology and present available options for quantitative risk assessment.

5.2. The Risk Assessment Process 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

5.2.1. Hazard Identification 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 -->
Agents that adversely affect the neurophysiological, neurochemical, or structural 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
integrity of the nervous system or the integration of nervous system function expressed as 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
modified behavior may be classified as neurotoxicants (Tilson, 1990b). For hazard 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
identification, the best or most generalizable studies would measure these changes in humans. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
With the exclusion of therapeutic agents, information on effects in humans is usually derived 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
from case reports of accidental exposures and epidemiological studies. This type of data 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
affords less certainty regarding generalizability as well as less specific exposure information. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
As discussed in chapter 4, a common alternative method of data generation for hazard 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
identification is the use of animal models. Animal models that measure behavioral, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
neurophysiological, neurochemical, and structural effects have been developed and validated. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Studies that employ these models to evaluate specific potential hazards are used to predict the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
outcome of exposure to the same hazard in humans. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

5.2.1.1. Human studies 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 -->
Information obtained through the evaluation of human exposure 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
data provides direct identification of neurotoxic hazards. This type of information is 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
generally available from clinical trials required for the approval of therapeutic products for 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
human use. For the purposes of risk assessment of nontherapeutic substances, data on effects 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
of exposure to humans come primarily from two types of studies, case reports and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
epidemiological (Friedlander and Hearn, 1980) (see chapter 3). Case studies can supply 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
evidence of an agent's toxicity, but are often limited by both the qualitative nature of the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
signs and symptoms reported and the nature of the exposure data. Epidemiological studies 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
can provide data on the types of neurotoxic effects and the possible susceptibilities of certain 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
populations. Under appropriate considerations, they can generally provide convincing and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
reliable evidence of potential human neurotoxicity. As with case studies, however, often 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
only qualitative estimates of exposure can be obtained. Controlled laboratory studies have 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the potential to provide adequate exposure and effects data for accurate hazard identification, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
but ethical considerations place moral and practical restrictions on such studies except in 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
those instances where direct benefit to the subjects, as in the case of therapeutic agents, may 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
be expected. Excluding instances of therapeutic product development, most studies are 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
limited to measuring the effects of acute, rather than long-term, exposure. This limits their 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
utility in risk assessment because the effect of long-term, low-level exposure to a potentially 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
toxic agent is often the issue of concern. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Methods available to evaluate neurotoxicity in humans include examination of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
neurophysiological and behavioral parameters. Specific tests to measure neuromuscular 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
strength and coordination, alterations in sensation, deficits in learning and memory, changes 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
in mood and personality, and disruptions of autonomic function are frequently employed (see 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
chapter 3).

5.2.1.2. Animal studies 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 -->
As discussed in chapter 4, animal models for many endpoints of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
neurotoxicity are available and widely used for hazard identification. Data from animal 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
studies are frequently extrapolated to humans. For example, if exposure to an agent 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
produces neuropathology in an animal model, damage to a comparable structure in humans is 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
predicted. Similarly, biochemical and physiological effects observed in animals are 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
commonly extrapolated to humans. Agents that produce alterations in the levels of specific 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
enzymes in one animal species generally have the same effect in other species, including 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
humans. Neurophysiological endpoints also tend to be affected by the same manipulations 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
across species. Thus, an agent interfering with nerve conduction in an animal study is often 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
assumed to have the same effect in humans. Behavioral studies in animals are also applied to 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
human hazard identification, although the correspondence between methods employed in 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
animals and humans is sometimes not as obvious. For this reason, behavioral methods 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
developed for neurotoxic hazard identification need to be considered on a case-by-case basis.

5.2.1.3. Special issues 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 -->
5.2.1.3.1. Animal-to-human extrapolation. The use of animal data to identify hazard to 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
humans is not without controversy. Relative sensitivity across species as well as between 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
sexes is a constant concern. Overly conservative risk assessments, based on the assumption 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
that humans are always more sensitive than a tested animal species, can result in poor risk 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
management decisions. Conversely, an assumption of equivalent sensitivity in a case where 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
humans actually are more sensitive to a given agent can result in underregulation that might 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
have a negative impact on human health. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
5.2.1.3.2. Susceptible populations. A related controversy concerns the use of data collected 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
from adult organisms, animal or human, to predict hazards in potentially more sensitive 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
populations, such as the very young and the elderly, or in other groups, such as the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
chronically ill. In some cases, identification of neurotoxicity hazard does not generally 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
include subjects from either end of the human life span or from other than healthy subjects. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Uncertainty factors are used to adjust for more sensitive populations. In addition, single or 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
multigeneration reproductive studies in animals may provide a source of information on 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
neurological disorders, behavioral changes, autonomical dysfunction, neuroanatomical 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
anomalies, and other signs of neurotoxicity in the developing animal (chapter 4). 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
5.2.1.3.3. Reversibility. For the most part, the basic principles of hazard identification are 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the same for neurotoxicity as for any adverse effect on health. One notable exception, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
however, concerns the issue of reversibility and the special consideration that must be given 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
to the inherent redundancy and plasticity of the nervous system. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
For many health effects, temporary, as opposed to permanent, effects are repaired 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
during a true recovery. Damage to many organ systems, if not severe, can be spontaneously 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
repaired. For example, damaged liver cells that may result in impaired liver function often 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
can be replaced with new cells that function normally. The resulting restoration of liver 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
function can be viewed as recovery. In the central nervous system, cells generally do not 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
recover from severe damage and new cells do not replace them. When nervous system 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
recovery is observed, it may represent compensation requiring activation of cells that were 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
previously performing some other function, reactive synaptogenesis, or recovery of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
moderately injured cells. While a damaged liver may recover due to the addition of new 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
cells, severe damage to nervous system cells results in a net loss of cells. This loss of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
compensatory capacity may not be noticed for many years and, when it does appear, it may 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
be manifest in a way seemingly unrelated to the original neurotoxic event. Lack of ability to 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
recover from a neurotoxic event later in life or premature onset of signs of normal aging may 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
result. It is therefore important to consider the possibility that significant damage to the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
nervous system may have occurred in experiments where effects appear to be reversible.
