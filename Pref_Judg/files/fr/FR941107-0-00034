Executive Order 12866
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
. The Director, Administration and Management, Office of the Secretary of Defense has determined that this Privacy
Act rule for the Department of Defense does not constitute `significant regulatory action'. Analysis of the rule
indicates that it does not have an annual effect on the economy of $100 million or more; does not create a serious inconsistency
or otherwise interfere with an action taken or planned by another agency; does not materially alter the budgetary
impact of entitlements, grants, user fees, or loan programs or the rights and obligations of recipients thereof;
does not raise novel legal or policy issues arising out of legal mandates, the President's priorities, or the principles
set forth in Executive Order 12866 (1993).

Policy. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
It is the policy of Department of the Navy to:
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(a) Ensure that all its personnel comply fully with 5 U.S.C. 552a, DoD Directive 5400.11 and DoD 5400.11&hyph;R, to
protect individuals from unwarranted invasions of privacy. Individuals covered by this protection are living citizens
of the U.S. or aliens lawfully admitted for permanent residence. A legal guardian of an individual or parent of a minor
when acting on the individual's or minor's behalf, has the same rights as the individual or minor. (A member of the Armed
Forces is not a minor for the purposes of this subpart and subpart G of this part).
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(b) Collect, maintain, and use only that personal information needed to support a Navy function or program as authorized
by law or E.O., and disclose this information only as authorized by 5 U.S.C. 552a and this subpart and subpart G of this
part. In assessing need, consideration shall be given to alternatives, such as use of information not individually
identifiable or use of sampling of certain data for certain individuals only. Additionally, consideration is to
be given to the length of time information is needed, and the cost of maintaining the information compared to the risks
and adverse consequences of not maintaining the information.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(c) Keep only personal information that is timely, accurate, complete, and relevant to the purpose for which it was
collected.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(d) Let individuals have access to, and obtain copies of, all or portions of their records, subject to exemption procedures
authorized by law and this subpart and subpart G of this part.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(e) Let individuals request amendment of their records when discrepancies proven to be erroneous, untimely, incomplete,
or irrelevant are noted.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(f) Let individuals request an administrative review of decisions that deny them access, or refuse to amend their
records.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(g) Ensure that adequate safeguards are enforced to prevent misuse, unauthorized disclosure, alteration, or destruction
of personal information in records.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(h) Maintain no records describing how an individual exercises his or her rights guaranteed by the First Amendment
(freedom of religion, political beliefs, speech, and press; peaceful assemblage; and petition for redress of grievances),
unless they are:
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(1) Expressly authorized by statute;
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(2) Authorized by the individual;
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(3) Within the scope of an authorized law enforcement activity; or
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(4) For the maintenance of certain items of information relating to religious affiliation for members of the naval
service who are chaplains. This should not be construed, however, as restricting or excluding solicitation of information
which the individual is willing to have in his or her record concerning religious preference, particularly that required
in emergency situations.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(5) Maintain only systems of records which have been published in the 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 -->
Federal Register
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
, in accordance with periodic Chief of Naval Operations Notes (OPNAVNOTEs) 5211 and &sect;701.105. These OPNAVNOTEs
5211 provide a listing of all Department of the Navy Privacy Act systems of records and identify the Office of Personnel
Management (OPM) government-wide systems containing information on Department of the Navy civilian employees,
even though technically, Department of the Navy does not have cognizance over them. A Privacy Act systems notice outlines
what kinds of information may be collected and maintained by naval activities. When collecting/maintaining information
in a Privacy Act system of records, review the systems notice to ensure activity compliance is within the scope of the
system. If you determine the systems notice does not meet your needs, contact the systems manager or Chief of Naval
Operations (N09B30) with your concerns so that amendment of the system may be considered.

Systems of records. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
To be subject to this subpart and subpart G of this part, a ``system of records'' must consist of ``records'' that are
retrieved by the name, or some other personal identifier, of an individual and be under the control of Department of
the Navy.

Retrieval practices.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 (1) Records in a group of records that are not retrieved by personal identifiers are not covered by this subpart and
subpart G of this part, even if the records contain information about individuals and are under the control of Department
of the Navy. The records must be retrieved by personal identifiers to become a system of records.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(2) If records previously not retrieved by personal identifiers are rearranged so they are retrieved by personal
identifiers, a new system notice must be submitted in accordance with &sect;701.107.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(3) If records in a system of records are rearranged so retrieval is no longer by personal identifiers, the records
are no longer subject to this subpart and subpart G of this part and the records system notice should be deleted in accordance

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
A record maintained in a system of records subject to this subpart and subpart G of this part must meet the following
criteria:
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(1) Be accurate. All information in the record must be factually correct.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(2) Be relevant. All information contained in the record must be related to the individual who is the record subject
and also must be related to a lawful purpose or mission of the Department of the Navy activity maintaining the record.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(3) Be timely. All information in the record must be reviewed periodically to ensure that it has not changed due to time
or later events.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(4) Be complete. It must be able to stand alone in accomplishing the purpose for which it is maintained.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(5) Be necessary. All information in the record must be needed to accomplish a Department of the Navy mission or purpose
established by Federal Law or E.O. of the President.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(c) 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Authority to establish systems of records. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Identify the specific Federal statute or E.O. of the President that authorizes maintaining each system of records.
When a naval activity uses its ``internal housekeeping'' statute, i.e., 5 U.S.C. 301, Departmental Regulations,
the naval instruction that implements the statute should also be identified. A statute or E.O. authorizing a system
of records does not negate the responsibility to ensure the information in the system of records is relevant and necessary.

System manager's evaluations and reviews.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 (1) Evaluate each new system of records. Before establishing a system of records, evaluate the information to be included
and consider the following:
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(i) The relationship of each item of information to be collected and retained to the purpose for which the system is
maintained (all information must be relevant to the purpose);
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(ii) The specific impact on the purpose or mission if each category of information is not collected (all information
must be necessary to accomplish a lawful purpose or mission.);
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(iii) The ability to meet the informational needs without using personal identifiers (will anonymous statistical
records meet the needs?);
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(iv) The length of time each item of information must be kept;
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(v) The methods of disposal; 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(vi) The cost of maintaining the information; and
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(vii) Whether a system already exists that serves the purpose of the new system.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(2) Evaluate and review all existing systems of records.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(i) When an alteration or amendment of an existing system is prepared pursuant to &sect;701.107(b) and (c), do the
evaluation described in &sect;701.105(e).
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(ii) Conduct the following reviews annually and be prepared to report, in accordance with &sect;701.104(c)(8),
the results and corrective actions taken to resolve problems uncovered.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(A) Training practices to ensure all personnel are familiar with the requirements of 5 U.S.C. 552a, and DoD Directive
5400.11, ``DoD Privacy Program'', this subpart and subpart G of this part, and any special needs their specific jobs
entail.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(B) Recordkeeping and disposal practices to ensure compliance with this subpart and subpart G of this part.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(C) Ongoing computer matching programs in which records from the system have been matched with non-DoD records to
ensure that the requirements of &sect;701.115 have been met.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(D) Actions of Department of the Navy personnel that resulted in either Department of the Navy being found civilly
liable or a person being found criminally liable under 5 U.S.C. 552a, to determine the extent of the problem and find
the most effective way of preventing the problem from occurring in the future.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(E) Each system of records notice to ensure it accurately describes the system. Where major changes are needed, alter
the system notice in accordance with &sect;701.107(b). If minor changes are needed, amend the system notice pursuant
to &sect;701.107(c).
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(iii) Every even-numbered year, review a random sample of Department of the Navy contracts that provide for the operation
of a system of records to accomplish a Department of the Navy function, to ensure the wording of each contract complies
with the provisions of 5 U.S.C. 552a and &sect;701.105(h).
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(iv) Every three years, beginning in 1992, review the routine use disclosures associated with each system of records
to ensure the recipient's use of the records continues to be compatible with the purpose for which the information

 (1) Applicability to Federal government contractors. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(i) When a naval activity contracts for the operation of a system of records to accomplish its function, the activity
must ensure compliance with this subpart and subpart G of this part and 5 U.S.C. 552a. For the purposes of the criminal
penalties described in 5 U.S.C. 552a, the contractor and its employees shall be considered employees of the agency
during the performance of the contract.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(ii) Consistent with Parts 24 and 52 of the Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR), contracts for the operation of a
system of records shall identify specifically the record system and the work to be performed, and shall include in
the solicitations and resulting contract the terms as prescribed by the FAR.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(iii) If the contractor must use records that are subject to this subpart and subpart G of this part to perform any part
of a contract, the contractor activities are subject to this subpart and subpart G of this part.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(B) Maintained as internal contractor employee records, even when used in conjunction with providing goods or services
to the naval activity;
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(C) Maintained as training records by an educational organization contracted by a naval activity to provide training
when the records of the contract students are similar to and commingled with training records of other students, such
as admission forms, transcripts, and academic counseling and similar records; or
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(D) Maintained by a consumer reporting agency to which records have been disclosed under contract in accordance with
31 U.S.C. 952d.

(D) Provide for the biennial review of a random sample of contracts that are subject to this subpart and subpart G of
this part.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(2) Contracting procedures. The Defense Acquisition Regulatory (DAR) Council, which oversees the implementation
of the FAR within the Department of Defense, is responsible for developing the specific policies and procedures for
soliciting, awarding, and administering contracts that are subject to this subpart and subpart G of this part and
5 U.S.C. 552a.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(3) Contractor compliance. Naval activities shall establish contract surveillance programs to ensure contractors
comply with the procedures established by the DAR Council under the preceding subparagraph.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(4) Disclosing records to contractors. Disclosing records to a contractor for use in performing a contract let by
a naval activity is considered a disclosure within Department of the Navy. The contractor is considered the agent
of Department of the Navy when receiving and maintaining the records for that activity.

Safeguarding records in systems of records. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Establish appropriate administrative, technical, and physical safeguards to ensure the records in every system
of records are protected from unauthorized alteration, destruction, or disclosure. Protect the records from reasonably
anticipated threats or hazards that could result in substantial harm, embarrassment, inconvenience, or unfairness
to any individual on whom information is maintained.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(a) 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Minimum standards.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 (1) Conduct risk analysis and management planning for each system of records. Consider sensitivity and use of the
records, present and projected threats and vulnerabilities, and present and projected cost-effectiveness of safeguards.
The risk analysis may vary from an informal review of a small, relatively insensitive system to a formal, fully quantified
risk analysis of a large, complex, and highly sensitive system.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(2) Train all personnel operating a system of records or using records from a system of records in proper record security
procedures.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(3) Label information exempt from disclosure under this subpart and subpart G of this part to reflect their sensitivity,
such as ``FOR OFFICIAL USE ONLY,'' ``PRIVACY ACT SENSITIVE: DISCLOSE ON A NEED-TO-KNOW BASIS ONLY,'' or some other
statement that alerts individuals of the sensitivity to the records.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(4) Administer special administrative, physical, and technical safeguards to protect records processed or stored
in an automated data processing or word processing system to protect them from threats unique to those environments.

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Records disposal.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 (1) Dispose of records from systems of records so as to prevent inadvertent disclosure. Disposal methods are considered
adequate if the records are rendered unrecognizable or beyond reconstruction (i.e., such as tearing, burning, melting,
chemical decomposition, burying, pulping, pulverizing, shredding, or mutilation). Magnetic media may be cleared
by completely erasing, overwriting, or degaussing the tape.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(2) The transfer of large volumes of records (e.g., printouts and computer cards) in bulk to a disposal activity such
as a Defense Reutilization and Marketing Office for authorized disposal is not a disclosure of records, if the volume
of records, coding of the information, or some other factor render it impossible to recognize any personal information
about a specific individual.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(3) When disposing or destroying large quantities of records from a system of records, care must be taken to ensure
that the bulk of the records is maintained to prevent easy identification of specific records. If such bulk is maintained,
no special procedures are required. If bulk is not maintained, or if the form of the records makes individually identifiable
information easily discernable, dispose of the records in accordance with 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
(a) 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Criteria for a new system of records. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
A new system of records is one for which no existing system notice has been published in the 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 -->
Federal Register
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
. If a notice for a system of records has been canceled or deleted, and it is determined that it should be reinstated or
reused, a new system notice must be published in the 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 -->
Federal Register
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
. Advance public notice must be given before a naval activity may begin to collect information for or use a new system
of records. The following procedures apply:
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(1) Describe in the record system notice the contents of the record system and the purposes and routine uses for which
the information will be used and disclosed.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(2) The public shall be given 30 days to comment on any proposed routine uses before the routine uses are implemented.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(3) The notice shall contain the date the system of records will become effective.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(b) 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Criteria for an alteration to a system of records notice. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
A system is considered altered when any one of the following actions occur or is proposed:
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(1) A significant increase or change in the number or types of individuals about whom records are maintained. For example,
a decision to expand a system of records that originally covered personnel assigned to only one naval activity to cover
personnel at several installations would constitute an altered system. An increase or decrease in the number of individuals
covered due to normal growth or decrease is not an alteration.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(2) A change that expands the types or categories of information maintained. For example, a personnel file that has

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
been expanded to include medical records would be an alteration.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(3) A change that alters the purpose for which the information is used. In order to be an alteration, the change must
be one that is not reasonably inferred from any of the existing purposes.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(4) A change to equipment configuration (either hardware or software) that creates substantially greater use of
records in the system. For example, placing interactive computer terminals at regional offices when the system was
formerly used only at the headquarters would be an alteration.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(5) A change in the manner in which records are organized or in the method by which records are retrieved.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(6) Combining record systems due to a reorganization within Department of the Navy.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(7) Retrieving by Social Security Numbers (SSNs), records that previously were retrieved only by names would be an
alteration if the present notice failed to indicate retrieval by SSNs. An altered system of records must be published
in the 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 -->
Federal Register
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
. Submission for an alteration must contain a narrative statement, the specific changes altering the system, and
the system of records notice. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(c) 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Criteria for amending a systems of records notice. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Minor changes to published system of records notices are considered amendments. All amendments should be forwarded
to CNO (N09B30) for publication in the 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 -->
Federal Register
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
. When submitting an amendment to a system of records notice, the naval activity must include a description of the specific
changes proposed and the system of records notice.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(d) 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Criteria for deleting a system of records notice. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
When a system of records is discontinued, incorporated into another system, or determined to be no longer subject
to this subpart and subpart G of this part, a deletion notice must be published in the 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 -->
Federal Register
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
. The deletion notice shall include the system identification number, system name, and the reason for deleting it.
If a system is deleted through incorporation into or merger with another system, identify the successor system in
the deletion notice.

Collecting information about individuals.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

(a) 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Collecting directly from the individual.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 To the greatest extent practicable, collect information for systems of records directly from the individual to whom
the record pertains if the record may be used to make an adverse determination about the individual's rights, benefits,
or privileges under the Federal programs.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(b) 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Collecting information about individuals from third persons. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
It might not always be practical to collect all information about an individual directly from that person, such as
verifying information through other sources for security or employment suitability determinations; seeking other
opinions, such as a supervisor's comments on past performance or other evaluations; obtaining the necessary information
directly from the individual would be exceptionally difficult or would result in unreasonable costs or delays; or,
the individual requests or consents to contacting another person to obtain the information.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(c) 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Soliciting the social security number (SSN).
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 (1) It is unlawful for any Federal, State, or local government agency to deny an individual a right, benefit, or privilege
provided by law because the individual refuses to provide his or her SSN. However, this prohibition does not apply
if a Federal law requires that the SSN be provided, or the SSN is required by a law or regulation adopted before January
1, 1975, to verify the individual's identity for a system of records established and in use before that date.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(2) Before requesting an individual to provide the SSN, the individual must be advised whether providing the SSN is
mandatory or voluntary; by what law or other authority the SSN is solicited; and what uses will be made of the SSN.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(3) The preceding advice relates only to the SSN. If other information about the individual is solicited for a system
of records, a Privacy Act statement (PAS) also must be provided to him/her. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(4) The notice published in the 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 -->
Federal Register
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 for each system of records containing SSNs solicited from individuals must indicate the authority for soliciting
the SSNs and whether it is mandatory for the individuals to provide their SSNs. E.O. 9397 requires federal agencies
to use SSNs as numerical identifiers for individuals in most federal records systems, however, it does not make it
mandatory for individuals to provide their SSNs.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(5) When entering military service or civilian employment with the Department of the Navy, individuals must provide
their SSNs. This is then the individual's numerical identifier and is used to establish personnel, financial, medical,
and other official records (as authorized by E.O. 9397). The individuals must be given the notification described
above. Once the individual has provided his or her SSN to establish the records, a notification is not required when
the SSN is requested only for identification or to locate the records.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(6) The Federal Personnel Manual
<FOOTCITE>8</FOOTCITE>
 must be consulted when soliciting SSNs for use in systems of records maintained by the Office of Personnel Management.

(7) A Department of the Navy activity may request an individual's SSN even though it is not required by Federal statute,
or is not for a system of records in existence and operating prior to January 1, 1975. However, the separate Privacy
Act Statement for the SSN, alone, or a merged Privacy Act Statement covering both the SSN and other items of personal
information, must make clear that disclosure of the number is voluntary. If the individual refuses to disclose his
or her SSN, the activity must be prepared to identify the individual by alternate means.

Contents of Privacy Act Statement.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(1) When an individual is requested to furnish information about himself/herself for a system of records, a Privacy
Act Statement must be provided to the individual, regardless of the method used to collect the information (i.e.,
forms, personal or telephonic interview, etc). If the information requested will not be included in a system of records,
a Privacy Act Statement is not required.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(2) The Privacy Act Statement shall include the following:
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(i) The Federal law or E.O. that authorizes collecting the information (i.e., E.O. 9397 authorizes collection of
SSNs);
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(ii) Whether or not it is mandatory for the individual to provide the requested information (It is only mandatory when
a Federal law or E.O. of the President specifically imposes a requirement to furnish the information and provides
a penalty for failure to do so. If furnishing information is a condition for granting a benefit or privilege voluntarily
sought by the individual, it is voluntary for the individual to give the information.);
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(iii) The principle purposes for collecting the information;
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(iv) The routine uses that will be made of the information (i.e., to whom and why it will be disclosed outside the Department
of Defense); and
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(v) The possible effects on the individual if the requested information is not provided.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(3) The Privacy Act Statement must appear on the form used to collect the information or on a separate form that can be
retained by the individual collecting the information. If the information is collected by means other than a form
completed by the individual, i.e., solicited over the telephone, the Privacy Act Statement should be read to the individual
and if requested by the individual, a copy sent to him/her. There is no requirement that the individual sign the Privacy
Act Statement. (e) 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

Format for Privacy Act Statement. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
When forms are used to collect information about individuals for a system of records, the Privacy Act Statement shall
appear as follows (listed in the order of preference):
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(1) Immediately below the title of the form,
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(2) Elsewhere on the front page of the form (clearly indicating it is the Privacy Act Statement),
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(3) On the back of the form with a notation of its location below the title of the form, or
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(4) On a separate form which the individual may keep.

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
(a) 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Individual access to records.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 (1) Right of access. Only individuals who are subjects of records maintained in systems of records and by whose personal
identifiers the records are retrieved have the right of individual access under this subpart and subpart G of this
part, unless they provide written authorization for their representative to act on their behalf. Legal guardians
or parents acting on behalf of a minor child also have the right of individual access under this subpart and subpart
G of this part.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(2) Notification of record's existence. Each naval activity shall establish procedures for notifying an individual,
in response to his or her request, if a system of records identified by him/her contains a record pertaining to the individual.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(3) Individual request for access. Individuals shall address requests for access to records in systems of records
to the system manager or the office designated in the Department of the Navy compilation of system notices (periodic
Chief of Naval Operations Notes (OPNAVNOTEs) 5211, ``Current Privacy Act Issuances'').
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(4) Verifying identity.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(i) An individual shall provide reasonable verification of identity before obtaining access to records. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(ii) When requesting records in writing, naval activities may not insist that a requester submit a notarized signature.
The courts have ruled that an alternative method of verifying identity must be established for individuals who do
not have access to notary services. This alternative permits requesters to provide an unsworn declaration that states
``I declare under perjury or penalty under the laws of the United States of American that the foregoing is true and correct.''
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(iii) When an individual seeks access in person, identification can be verified by documents normally carried by
the individual (i.e., identification card, driver's license, or other license, permit or pass normally used for
identification purposes).
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(iv) When access is requested other than in writing, identity may be verified by the individual's providing minimum
identifying data such as full name, date and place of birth, or other information necessary to locate the record sought.
If the information sought is sensitive, additional identifying data may be required. Telephonic requests should
not be honored.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(v) Allow an individual to be accompanied by a person of his or her choice when viewing the record; however, require
the individual to provide written authorization to have the record discussed in front of the other person.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(vi) Do not deny access to an individual who is the subject of the record solely for refusing to divulge his or her SSN,
unless it is the only means of retrieving the record or verifying identity.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(vii) Do not require the individual to explain why he or she is seeking access to a record under this subpart and subpart
G of this part.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(viii) Only a designated denial authority may deny access. The denial must be in writing and contain the information
required by &sect;701.109(d).
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(5) Blanket requests not honored. Do not honor requests from individuals for notification and/or access concerning
all Department of the Navy systems of records. In these instances, notify the individual that requests for notification
and/or access must be directed to the appropriate system manager for the particular record system being requested,
as indicated in the periodic Chief of Naval Operations Notes (OPNAVNOTEs) 5211, ``Current Privacy Act Issuances'';
and the request must either designate the particular system of records to be searched, or provide sufficient information
for the system manager to identify the appropriate system. Also, provide the individual with any other information
needed for obtaining consideration of his or her request.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(6) Granting individual access to records.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(i) Grant the individual access to the original record (or exact copy) without any changes or deletions, other than
those made in accordance with &sect;701.113.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(ii) Grant the individual's request for an exact copy of the record, upon the signed authorization of the individual,
and provide a copy to anyone designated by the individual. In either case, the copying fees may be assessed to the individual
pursuant to &sect;701.109(b).
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(iii) If requested, explain any record or portion of a record that is not understood, as well as any changes or deletions.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(7) Illegible or incomplete records. Do not deny an individual access solely because the physical condition or format
of the record does not make it readily available (i.e., when the record is in a deteriorated state or on magnetic tape).
Either prepare an extract or recopy the document exactly.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(8) Access by parents and legal guardians.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(i) The parent of any minor, or the legal guardian of any individual declared by a court of competent jurisdiction to
be incompetent due to physical or mental incapacity or age, may obtain access to the record of the minor or incompetent
individual if the parent or legal guardian is acting on behalf or for the benefit of the minor or incompetent. However,
with respect to access by parents and legal guardians to medical records and medical determinations about minors,
use the following procedures:
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(A) In the United States, the laws of the state where the records are located might afford special protection to certain
medical records (i.e., drug and alcohol abuse treatment, and psychiatric records). The state statutes might apply
even if the records are maintained by a naval medical facility.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(B) For installations located outside the U.S., the parent or legal guardian of a minor shall be denied access if all
four of the following conditions are met:
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
(1) 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The minor at the time of the treatment or consultation was 15, 16, or 17 years old;
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
(2) 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The treatment or consultation was within a program authorized by law or regulation to provide confidentiality to
the minor;
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
(3) 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The minor indicated a desire that the treatment or consultation record be handled in confidence and not disclosed
to a parent or guardian; and
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
(4) 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The parent or legal guardian does not have the written authorization of the minor or a valid court order granting access.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(ii) A minor or incompetent has the same right of access as any other individual under this subpart and subpart G of this
part. The right of access of the parent or legal guardian is in addition to that of the minor or incompetent.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(9) Access to information compiled in reasonable anticipation of a civil proceeding.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(i) An individual is not entitled under this subpart and subpart G of this part to access information compiled in reasonable
anticipation of a civil action or proceeding.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(ii) The term ``civil action or proceeding'' includes quasi-judicial and pre-trial judicial proceedings, as well
as formal litigation.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(iii) Section 701.109(9)(i) and (ii) do not prohibit access to records compiled or used for purposes other than litigation,
nor prohibit access to systems of records solely because they are frequently subject to litigation. The information
must have been compiled for the primary purpose of litigation.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(10) Personal notes or records not under the control of the Department of the Navy.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(i) Certain documents under the control of a Department of the Navy employee and used to assist him/her in performing
official functions are not considered Department of the Navy records within the meaning of this subpart and subpart
G of this part. These documents are not systems of records that are subject to this subpart and subpart G of this part,
if they are:
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(A) Maintained and discarded solely at the discretion of the author;
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(B) Created only for the author's personal convenience;
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(C) Not the result of official direction or encouragement, whether oral or written; and
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(D) Not shown to other persons for any reason or filed in agency files.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(11) Relationship between the Privacy Act and FOIA. In some instances, individuals requesting access to records
pertaining to themselves may not know which Act to cite as the appropriate statutory authority. The following guidelines
are to ensure that the individuals receive the greatest degree of access under both Acts: 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(i) Access requests that specifically state or reasonably imply that they are made under 5 U.S.C. 552 (1988) as amended
by the Freedom of Information Reform Act of 1986, are processed under Secretary of the Navy Instruction 5720.42E,
``Department of the Navy Freedom of Information Act Program.''
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(ii) Access requests that specifically state or reasonably imply that they are made under 5 U.S.C. 552a are processed
under this subpart and subpart G of this part.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(iii) Access requests that cite both 5 U.S.C. 552a, as amended by the Computer Matching Act of 1988 and 5 U.S.C. 552 (1988)
as amended by the Freedom of Information Reform Act are processed under the Act that provides the greater degree of
access. Inform the requester which instruction was used in granting or denying access.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(iv) Do not penalize the individual access to his or her records otherwise releasable under 5 U.S.C. 552a and periodic
Chief of Naval Operations Notes (OPNAVNOTEs) 5211, ``Current Privacy Act Issuances'', simply because he or she failed
to cite the appropriate statute or instruction.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(12) Time Limits. Acknowledge requests for access made under Privacy Act or this subpart and subpart G of this part
within 10 working days after receipt, and advise the requester of your decision to grant/deny access within 30 working
days. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

Reproduction fees. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Normally, only one copy of any record or document will be provided. Checks or money orders for fees should be made payable
to the Treasurer of the United States and deposited to the miscellaneous receipts of the treasury account maintained
at the finance office servicing the activity.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(1) Fee schedules shall include only the direct cost of reproduction and shall not include costs of: 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(i) Time or effort devoted to searching for or reviewing the record by naval personnel; 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(ii) Fees not associated with the actual cost of reproduction;
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(iii) Producing a copy when it must be provided to the individual without cost under another regulation, directive,
or law; 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(iv) Normal postage; 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(v) Transportation of records or personnel; or 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(vi) Producing a copy when the individual has requested only to review the record and has not requested a copy to keep,
and the only means of allowing review is to make a copy (e.g., the record is stored in a computer and a copy must be printed
to provide individual access, or the naval activity does not wish to surrender temporarily the original record for
the individual to review).

Denying individual access.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 (1) Deny the record subject access to requested record only if it was compiled in reasonable anticipation of a civil
action or proceeding or is in a system of records that has been exempt from the access provisions of &sect;701.113.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(2) Deny the individual access only to those portions of the record for which the denial will serve a legitimate government
purpose. An individual may be refused access for failure to comply with established procedural requirements, but
must be told the specific reason for the refusal and the proper access procedures.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(3) Deny the individual access to his or her medical and psychological records if it is determined that access could
have an adverse affect on the mental or physical health of the individual. This determination normally should be made
in consultation with a medical practitioner. If it is medically indicated that access could have an adverse mental
or physical effect on the individual, provide the record to a medical practitioner named by the individual, along
with an explanation of why access without medical supervision could be harmful to the individual. In any case, do not
require the named medical practitioner to request the record for the individual. If, however, the individual refuses
or fails to designate a medical practitioner, access shall be refused. The refusal is not considered a denial for reporting
purposes under the Privacy Act.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Encourage individuals to review periodically, the information maintained about them in systems of records, and
to avail themselves of the amendment procedures established by this subpart and subpart G of this part.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(1) Right to amend. An individual may request to amend any record retrieved by his or her personal identifier from a
system of records, unless the system has been exempt from the amendment procedures under this subpart. Amendments
under this subpart and subpart G of this part are limited to correcting factual matters, not matters of opinion (i.e.,
information contained in evaluations of promotion potential or performance appraisals). When records sought to
be amended are covered by another issuance, the administrative procedures under that issuance must be exhausted
before using the Privacy Act. In other words, the Privacy Act may not be used to avoid the administrative procedures
required by the issuance actually covering the records in question.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(2) In writing. Amendment requests shall be in writing, except for routine administrative changes, such as change
of address.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(3) Content of amendment request. An amendment request must include a description of the information to be amended;
the reason for the amendment; the type of amendment action sought (i.e., deletion, correction, or addition); and
copies of available documentary evidence supporting the request.

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
This subpart and subpart G of this part do not permit the alteration of evidence presented in the course of judicial
or quasi-judicial proceedings. Amendments to such records must be made in accordance with procedures established
for such proceedings. This subpart and subpart G of this part do not permit a collateral attack on a judicial or quasi-judicial
finding; however, this subpart and subpart G of this part may be used to challenge the accuracy of recording the finding
in a system of records.

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Standards for amendment request determinations. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The record which the individual requests to be amended must meet the recordkeeping standards established in &sect;701.105.
The record must be accurate, relevant, timely, complete, and necessary. If the record in its present state does not
meet each of the criteria, grant the amendment request to the extent necessary to meet them.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Time limits. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Within 10 working days of receiving an amendment request, the systems manager shall provide the individual a written
acknowledgement of the request. If action on the amendment request is completed within the 10 working days and the
individual is so informed, no separate acknowledgment is necessary. The acknowledgment must clearly identify the
request and advise the individual when to expect notification of the completed action. Only under exceptional circumstances
should more than 30 working days be required to complete the action on an amendment request. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Granting an amendment request in whole or in part.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 (1) Notify the requester. To the extent the amendment request is granted, the systems manager shall notify the individual
and make the appropriate amendment. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(2) Notify previous recipients. Notify all previous recipients of the information (as reflected in the disclosure
accounting record) that the amendment has been made and provide each a copy of the amended record. Recipients who are
known to be no longer retaining the record need not be advised of the amendment. If it is known that other naval activities,
DoD components, or Federal agencies have been provided the information that now requires amendment, or if the individual
requests that these agencies be notified, provide the notification of amendment even if those activities or agencies
are not listed on the disclosure accounting form.

to the individual the following: 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(1) Those sections of 5 U.S.C. 552a or this subpart and subpart G of this part upon which the denial is based; 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(2) His or her right to appeal to the head of the activity for an independent review of the initial denial; 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(3) The procedures for requesting an appeal, including the title and address of the official to whom the appeal should
be sent; and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(4) Where the individual can receive assistance in filing the appeal.

of disagreement listing the reasons for disagreeing with the refusal to amend.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(2) If possible, incorporate the statement of disagreement into the record. If that is not possible, annotate the
record to reflect that the statement was filed and maintain the statement so that it can be readily obtained when the
disputed information is used or disclosed.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(3) Furnish copies of the statement of disagreement to all individuals listed on the disclosure accounting form (except
those known to be no longer retaining the record), as well as to all other known holders of copies of the record.

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Conditions of disclosure.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 (1) 5 U.S.C. 552a prohibits an agency from disclosing any record contained in a system of records to any person or agency,
except when the record subject gives written consent for the disclosure or when one of the 12 conditions listed below
in this subsection applies.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(2) Except for disclosures made under 5 U.S.C. 552 (1988) as amended by the Freedom of Information Reform Act of 1986
and Secretary of the Navy Instruction 5720.42E, ``Department of the Navy Freedom of Information Act Program,'' before
disclosing any record from a system of records to any recipient other than a Federal agency, make reasonable efforts
to ensure the record is accurate, relevant, timely, and complete for Department of the Navy purposes. Records discovered
to have been improperly filed in the system of records should be removed before disclosure.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(i) If validation cannot be obtained from the record itself, the naval activity may contact the record subject (if
reasonably available) to verify the accuracy, timeliness, completeness, and relevancy of the information.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(ii) If validation cannot be obtained from the record and the record subject is not reasonably available, advise the
recipient that the information is believed to be valid as of a specific date and reveal any factors bearing on the validity
of the information.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(b) 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Nonconsensual disclosures. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
5 U.S.C. 552a provides 12 instances when a record in a system of records may be disclosed without the written consent
of the record subject:
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(1) Disclosures within the Department of Defense. For purposes of disclosing records, the Department of Defense
is considered a single agency; hence, a record may be disclosed to any officer or employee in the Department of Defense
(including private contractor personnel who are engaged to perform services needed in connection with the operation
of a system of records for a DoD component), who have a need for the record in the performance of their duties, provided
this use is compatible with the purpose for which the record is maintained. This provision is based on the ``need to
know'' concept.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(i) For example, this may include disclosure to personnel managers, review boards, discipline officers, courts-martial
personnel, medical officers, investigating officers, and representatives of the Judge Advocate General, Auditor
General, Naval Inspector General, or the Naval Investigative Service, who require the information in order to discharge
their official duties. Examples of personnel outside the Department of the Navy who may be included are: Personnel
of the Joint Staff, Armed Forces Entrance and Examining Stations, Defense Investigative Service, or the other military
departments, who require the information in order to discharge an official duty.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(ii) It may also include the transfer of records between naval components and non-DoD agencies in connection with
the Personnel Exchange Program (PEP) and interagency support agreements. Disclosure accountings are not required
for intra-agency disclosure and disclosures made in connection with interagency support agreements or the PEP.
Although some disclosures authorized by this paragraph might also meet the criteria for disclosure under other exceptions
specified in the following paragraphs of this section, they should be treated under this paragraph for disclosure
accounting purposes.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(2) Disclosures required by the FOIA.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(i) A record must be disclosed if required by 5 U.S.C. 552 (1988) as amended by the Freedom of Information Reform Act
of 1986, which is implemented by Secretary of the Navy Instruction 5720.42E, ``Department of the Navy Freedom of Information
Act Program.''
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(ii) 5 U.S.C. 552 (1988) as amended by the Freedom of Information Reform Act of 1986 and Secretary of the Navy Instruction
5720.42E, ``Department of the Navy Freedom of Information Act Program'' require that records be made available to
any person requesting them in writing, unless the record is exempt from disclosure under one of the nine FOIA exemptions.
Therefore, if a record is not exempt from disclosure, it must be provided to the requester.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(iii) Certain records, such as personnel, medical, and similar files, are exempt from disclosure under exemption
(b)(6) of 5 U.S.C. 552 (1988) as amended by the Freedom of Information Act Reform Act of 1986. Under that exemption,
disclosure of information pertaining to an individual can be denied only when the disclosure would be a clearly unwarranted
invasion of personal privacy. The first step is to determine whether a viable personal privacy interest exists in
these records involving an identifiable living person. The second step is to consider how disclosure would benefit
the general public in light of the content and context of the information in question. The third step is to determine
whether the identified public interests qualify for consideration. The fourth step is to balance the personal privacy
interests against the qualifying public interest. Numerous factors must be considered such as: The nature of the
information to be disclosed (i.e., Do individuals normally have an expectation of privacy in the type of information
to be disclosed?); importance of the public interest served by the disclosure and probability of further disclosure
which may result in an unwarranted invasion of privacy; relationship of the requester to the public interest being
served; newsworthiness of the individual to whom the information pertains (i.e., high ranking officer, public figure);
degree of sensitivity of the information from the standpoint of the individual or the individual's family, and its
potential for being misused to the harm, embarrassment, or inconvenience of the individual or the individual's family;
the passage of time since the event which is the topic of the record (i.e., to disclose that an individual has been arrested
and is being held for trial by court-martial is normally permitted, while to disclose an arrest which did not result
in conviction might not be permitted after the passage of time); and the degree to which the information is already
in the public domain or is already known by the particular requester.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(iv) Records or information from investigatory records, including personnel security investigatory records,
are exempt from disclosure under the broader standard of ``an unwarranted invasion of personal privacy'' found in
exemption (b)(7)(C) of 5 U.S.C. 552. This broader standard applies only to records or information compiled for law
enforcement purposes.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(v) A disclosure under 5 U.S.C. 552 about military members must be in accordance with Secretary of the Navy Instruction
5720.42E, ``Department of the Navy Freedom of Information Act Program'', but the following information normally
may be disclosed from military personnel records (except for those personnel assigned to sensitive or routinely
deployable units, or located in a foreign territory), without a clearly unwarranted invasion of personal privacy:
Full name, rank, date of rank, base pay, past duty stations, present duty station and future duty station (if finalized),
unless the stations have been determined by the Department of the Navy to be sensitive, routinely deployable, or located
in a foreign territory, office or duty telephone number, source of commission, promotion sequence number, awards
and decorations, attendance at professional military schools, and duty status at any given time.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(vi) The following information normally may be disclosed from civilian employee records about CONUS employees:
Full name, present and past position titles and occupational series, present and past grades, present and past annual
salary rates (including performance awards or bonuses, incentive awards, merit pay amount, Meritorious and Distinguished
Executive Ranks, and allowances and differentials), past duty stations, present duty station and future duty station
(if finalized), including room numbers, shop designations, or other identifying information regarding buildings
or places of employment, unless the duty stations have been determined by the Department of the Navy to be sensitive,
routinely deployable, or located in a foreign territory, position descriptions, identification of job elements,
and those performance standards (but not actual performance appraisals) that the disclosure of which would not interfere
with law enforcement programs or severely inhibit Department of the Navy effectiveness.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(viii) Disclosure of home addresses and home telephone numbers normally is considered a clearly unwarranted invasion
of personal privacy and is prohibited. However, they may be disclosed if the individual has consented to the disclosure;
the disclosure is required by the FOIA; the disclosure is required by another law, such as 42 U.S.C. 653, which provides
assistance to states in locating parents who have defaulted on child support payments, or the collection of alimony,
and to state and local tax authorities for the purpose of enforcing tax laws. However, care must be taken prior to release
to ensure that a written record is prepared to document the reasons for the release determination.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(A) When compiling home addresses and telephone numbers, the individual may be offered the option of authorizing
disclosure of the information without further consent for specific purposes, such as locator services. In that case,
the information may be disclosed for the stated purpose without further consent. If the information is to be disclosed
for any other purpose, a signed consent permitting the additional disclosure must be obtained from the individual.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(B) Before listing home addresses and telephone numbers in Department of the Navy telephone directories, give the
individual the opportunity to refuse such a listing. If the individual requests that the home address or telephone
number not be listed in the directory, do not assess any additional fee associated with maintaining an unlisted number
for government-owned telephone services.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(C) The sale or rental of lists of names and addresses is prohibited unless such action is specifically authorized
by Federal law. This does not prohibit the disclosure of names and addresses made under Secretary of the Navy Instruction
5720.42E, ``Department of the Navy Freedom of Information Act Program.''
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(D) In response to FOIA requests, information concerning special and general courts-martial results (e.g., records
of trial) are releasable. However, information regarding summary courts-martial and non-judicial punishment
are generally not releasable. The balancing of interests must be done. It is possible that in a particular case, information
regarding non-judicial punishment should be disclosed pursuant to a FOIA request (i.e., the facts leading to a nonjudicial
punishment are particularly newsworthy or the case involves a senior official abusing the public trust through office-related
misconduct, such as embezzlement). Announcement of nonjudicial punishment dispositions under JAGMAN, subsection
0107, is a proper exercise of command authority and not a release of information under FOIA or this subpart and subpart
G of this part. Exceptions to this policy must be coordinated with CNO (N09B30) or CMC (MI&hyph;3) prior to responding
to requesters, including all requests for this type of information from members of Congress.

(3) Disclosures for established routine uses.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(i) Records may be disclosed outside the Department of the Navy if the disclosure is for an established routine use.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(ii) A routine use shall:
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(A) Be compatible with and related to the purpose for which the record was created;
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(B) Identify the persons or organizations to whom the record may be disclosed;
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(C) Identify specifically the uses for which the information may be employed by the receiving person or organization;
and
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(D) Have been published previously in the 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 -->
Federal Register
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(iii) A routine use shall be established for each user of the information outside the Department of the Navy who needs
the information for an official purpose.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(iv) Routine uses may be established, discontinued, or amended without the consent of the individuals to whom the
records pertain. However, new and amended routine uses must be published in the 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 -->
Federal Register
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 at least 30 days before the information may be disclosed under their provisions.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(v) In addition to the routine uses established by the Department of the Navy for each system of records, common ``Blanket
Routine Uses,'' applicable to all record systems maintained with the Department of the Navy, have been established.
These ``Blanket Routine Uses'' are published at the beginning of the Department of the Navy's 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 -->
Federal Register
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 compilation of record systems notices rather than at each system notice and are also reflected in periodic Chief of
Naval Operations Notes (OPNAVNOTEs) 5211, ``Current Privacy Act Issuances.'' Unless a system notice specifically
excludes a system of records from a ``Blanket Routine Use,'' all ``Blanket Routine Uses'' apply to that system.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(vi) If the recipient has not been identified in the 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 -->
Federal Register
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 or if the recipient, though identified, intends to employ the information for a purpose not published in the 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 -->
Federal Register
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
, the written consent of the individual is required before the disclosure can be made.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(4) Disclosures to the Bureau of the Census. Records may be disclosed to the Bureau of the Census for purposes of planning
or carrying out a census, survey, or related activities authorized by 13 U.S.C. 8.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(5) Disclosures for statistical research or reporting. Records may be disclosed to a recipient for statistical research
or reporting if:
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(i) Prior to the disclosure, the recipient has provided adequate written assurance that the records shall be used
solely for statistical research or reporting; and
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(ii) The records are transferred in a form that does not identify individuals.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(6) Disclosures to the National Archives and Records Administration.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(i) Records may be disclosed to the National Archives and Records Administration for evaluation to determine whether
the records have sufficient historical or other value to warrant preservation by the Federal government. If preservation
is warranted, the records will be retained by the National Archives and Record Administration, which becomes the
official owner of the records. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(ii) Records may be disclosed to the National Archives and Records Administration to carry out records management
inspections required by Federal law.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(iii) Records transferred to a Federal Records Center operated by the National Archives and Records Administration
for storage are not within this category. Those records continue to be maintained and controlled by the transferring
naval activity. The Federal Records Center is considered the agent of Department of the Navy and the disclosure is
made under &sect;701.112(b)(1).
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(7) Disclosures when requested for law enforcement purposes.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(i) A record may be disclosed to another agency or an instrumentality of any governmental jurisdiction within or under
the control of the U.S. for a civil or criminal law enforcement activity if:
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(A) The civil or criminal law enforcement activity is authorized by law (federal, state or local); and
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(B) The head of the agency (or his or her designee) has made a written request to the naval activity specifying the particular
record or portion desired and the law enforcement purpose for which it is sought.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(ii) Blanket requests for any and all records pertaining to an individual shall not be honored. The requesting agency
must specify each record or portion desired and how each relates to the authorized law enforcement activity.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(iii) If a naval activity discloses a record outside the Department of Defense for law enforcement purposes without
the individual's consent and without an adequate written request, the disclosure must be under an established routine
use, such as the ``Blanket Routine Use'' for law enforcement.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(iv) Disclosure to foreign law enforcement agencies is not governed by the provisions of 5 U.S.C. 552a and this paragraph,
but may be made only under established ``Blanket Routine Uses,'' routine uses published in the individual record
system notice, or to other governing authority.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(8) Disclosure to protect the health or safety of an individual. Disclosure may be made under emergency conditions
involving circumstances affecting the health and safety of an individual (i.e., when the time required to obtain
the consent of the individual to whom the records pertain might result in a delay which could impair the health or safety
of a person) provided notification of the disclosure is sent to the record subject. Sending the notification to the
last known address is sufficient. In instances where information is requested by telephone, an attempt will be made
to verify the inquirer's and medical facility's identities and the caller's telephone number. The requested information,
if then considered appropriate and of an emergency nature, may be provided by return call.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(9) Disclosures to Congress.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(i) A record may be disclosed to either House of Congress at the request of either the Senate or House of Representatives
as a whole. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(ii) A record also may be disclosed to any committee, subcommittee, or joint committee of Congress if the disclosure
pertains to a matter within the legislative or investigative jurisdiction of the committee, subcommittee, or joint
committee.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(iii) Disclosure may not be made to a Member of Congress requesting in his or her individual capacity. However, for
Members of Congress making inquiries on behalf of individuals who are subjects of records, a ``Blanket Routine Use''
has been established to permit disclosures to individual Members of Congress.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(A) When responding to a congressional inquiry made on behalf of a constituent by whose identifier the record is retrieved,
there is no need to verify that the individual has authorized the disclosure to the Member of Congress.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(B) The oral or written statement of a Congressional staff member is sufficient to establish that a request has been
received from the individual to whom the record pertains.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(C) If the constituent inquiry is made on behalf of an individual other than the record subject, provide the Member
of Congress only that information releasable under 5 U.S.C. 552. Advise the Member of Congress that the written consent
of the record subject is required before additional information may be disclosed. Do not contact the record subject
to obtain consent for the disclosure to the Member of Congress unless the Congressional office specifically requests
it be done.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(10) Disclosures to the Comptroller General for the General Accounting Office (GAO). Records may be disclosed to
the Comptroller General of the U.S., or authorized representative, in the course of the performance of the duties
of the GAO.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(11) Disclosures under court orders.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(i) Records may be disclosed under the order of a court of competent jurisdiction.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(ii) When a record is disclosed under this provision and the compulsory legal process becomes a matter of public record,
make reasonable efforts to notify the individual to whom the record pertains. Notification sent to the last known
address of the individual is sufficient. If the order has not yet become a matter of public record, seek to be advised
as to when it will become public. Neither the identity or the party to whom the disclosure was made nor the purpose of
the disclosure shall be made available to the record subject unless the court order has become a matter of public record.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(iii) The court order must bear the signature of a federal, state, or local judge. Orders signed by court clerks or attorneys
are not deemed to be orders of a court of competent jurisdiction. A photocopy of the order, regular on its face, will
be sufficient evidence of the court's exercise of its authority of the minimal requirements of SECNAVINST 5820.8A

(12) Disclosures to consumer reporting agencies. Certain information may be disclosed to consumer reporting agencies
(i.e., credit reference companies such as TRW and Equifax, etc.) as defined by the Federal Claims Collection Act of
1966 (31 U.S.C. 952d). Under the provisions of that Act, the following information may be disclosed to a consumer reporting
agency: 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(i) Name, address, taxpayer identification number (SSN), and other information necessary to establish the identity
of the individual; 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(ii) The amount, status, and history of the claim; and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(iii) The agency or program under which the claim arose. 31 U.S.C. 952d specifically requires that the

(c) 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Disclosures to commercial enterprises. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Records may be disclosed to commercial enterprises only under the criteria established by Secretary of the Navy Instruction
5720.42E and 42 U.S.C. 653, Parent Locator Service for Enforcement of Child Support.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(1) Any information required to be disclosed by Secretary of the Navy Instruction 5720.42E and 42 U.S.C. 653, Parent
Locator Service for Enforcement of Child Support may be disclosed to a requesting commercial enterprise.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(2) Commercial enterprises may present a consent statement signed by the individual indicating specific conditions
for disclosing information from a record. Statements such as the following, if signed by the individual, are considered
sufficient to authorize the disclosure: I hereby authorize the Department of the Navy to verify my SSN or other identifying
information and to disclose my home address and telephone number to authorized representatives of (name of commercial
enterprise) to be used in connection with my commercial dealings with that enterprise. All information furnished
will be used in connection with my financial relationship with (name of commercial enterprise).
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(3) When a consent statement as described in the preceding subsection is presented, provide the information to the
commercial enterprise, unless the disclosure is prohibited by another regulation or Federal law.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(4) Blanket consent statements that do not identify the Department of Defense or Department of the Navy, or that do
not specify exactly the information to be disclosed, may be honored if it is clear that the individual, in signing the
consent statement, was seeking a personal benefit (i.e., loan for a house or automobile) and was aware of the type of
information necessary to obtain the benefit sought.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(5) Do not honor requests from commercial enterprises for official evaluations of personal characteristics such
as personal financial habits. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

Disclosure of Health Care Records to the Public. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
This paragraph applies to disclosure of information to the news media and the public concerning individuals treated
or hospitalized in Department of the Navy medical facilities and, when the cost of care is paid by the Department of
the Navy, in non-Federal facilities.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(1) Disclosures without the individual's consent. Normally, the following information may be disclosed without
the individual's consent:
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(i) Information required to be released by Secretary of the Navy Instruction 5720.42E and OPM Regulations and the
Federal Personnel Manual, as well as the information listed in &sect;701.112(b)(2)(v) for military personnel and
in &sect;701.112(b)(2).
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(ii) For civilian employees; and
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(iii) General information concerning medical conditions, i.e., date of admission or disposition; present medical
assessment of the individual's condition if the medical practitioner has volunteered the information, i.e., the
individual's condition presently is (stable) (good) (fair) (serious) (critical), and the patient is (conscious)
(semi-conscious) (unconscious).
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(2) Disclosures with the individual's consent. With the individual's informed consent, any information about the
individual may be disclosed. If the individual is a minor or has been declared incompetent by a court of competent jurisdiction,
the parent of the minor or appointed legal guardian of the incompetent may give consent on behalf of the individual.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Disclosure of Personal Information on Group/Bulk Orders. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Do not use personal information including complete SSNs, home addresses and phone numbers, dates of birth, etc.,
on group/bulk orders. This personal information should not be posted on lists that everyone listed on the orders sees.
Such a disclosure of personal information violates the Privacy Act and this subpart and subpart G of this part.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(f) 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Disclosure Accounting. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Keep an accurate record of all disclosures made from a record (including those made with the consent of the individual)
except those made to DoD personnel for use in performing their official duties; and those made under the FOIA. Disclosure
accounting is to permit the individual to determine what agencies or persons have been provided information from
the record, enable Department of the Navy activities to advise prior recipients of the record of any subsequent amendments
or statements of dispute concerning the record, and provide an audit trial of Department of the Navy's compliance
with 5 U.S.C. 552a.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(1) Disclosure accountings shall contain the date of the disclosure; a description of the information disclosed;
the purpose of the disclosure; and the name and address of the person or agency to whom the disclosure was made. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(2) The record subject has the right of access to the disclosure accounting except when the disclosure was made at the
request of a civil or criminal law enforcement agency under &sect;701.112(b)(7); or when the system of records has
been exempted from the requirement to provide access to the disclosure accounting.

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Methods of disclosure accounting. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Since the characteristics of various records maintained within the Department of the Navy vary widely, no uniform
method for keeping disclosure accountings is prescribed. The primary criteria are that the selected method be one
which will:
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(1) Enable an individual to ascertain what persons or agencies have received disclosures pertaining to him/her;
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(2) Provide a basis for informing recipients of subsequent amendments or statements of dispute concerning the record;
and
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(3) Provide a means to prove, if necessary that the activity has complied with the requirements of 5 U.S.C. 552a and
this subpart and subpart G of this part.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(h) 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Retention of Disclosure Accounting. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Maintain a disclosure accounting of the life of the record to which the disclosure pertains, or 5 years after the date
of the disclosure, whichever is longer. Disclosure accounting records are normally maintained with the record,
as this will ensure compliance with &sect;701.112(f).

Using exemptions. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
No system of records is automatically exempt from all provisions of 5 U.S.C. 552a. A system of records is exempt from
only those provisions of 5 U.S.C. 552a that are identified specifically in the exemption rule for the system. Subpart
G of this part contains the systems designated as exempt, the types of exemptions claimed, the authority and reasons
for invoking the exemptions and the provisions of 5 U.S.C. 552a from which each system has been exempt. Exemptions
are discretionary on the part of Department of the Navy and are not effective until published as a final rule in the 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 -->
Federal Register
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
. The naval activity maintaining the system of records shall make a determination that the system is one for which an
exemption may be established and then propose an exemption rule for the system. Submit the proposal to CNO (N09B30)
for approval and publication in the

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Types of exemptions. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
There are two types of exemptions permitted by 5 U.S.C. 552a.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(1) 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
General exemptions.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 Those that authorize the exemption of a system of records from all but specifically identified provisions of 5 U.S.C.
552a.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(2) 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Specific exemptions.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 Those that allow a system of records to be exempt from only a few designated provisions of 5 U.S.C. 552a. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(c) 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Establishing exemptions.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 (1) 5 U.S.C. 552a authorizes the Secretary of the Navy to adopt rules designating eligible systems of records as exempt
from certain requirements. The Secretary of the Navy has delegated the CNO (N09B30) to make a determination that the
system is one for which an exemption may be established and then propose and establish an exemption rule for the system.
No system of records within Department of the Navy shall be considered exempt until the CNO (N09B30) has approved the
exemption and an exemption rule has been published as a final rule in the 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 -->
Federal Register
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
. A system of records is exempt from only those provisions of 5 U.S.C. 552a that are identified specifically in the Department
of the Navy exemption rule for the system.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(2) No exemption may be established for a system of records until the system itself has been established by publishing
a notice in the 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 -->
Federal Register
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
, at least 30 days prior to the effective date, describing the system. This allows interested persons an opportunity
to comment. An exemption may not be used to deny an individual access to information that he or she can obtain under Secretary
of the Navy Instruction 5720.42E, ``Department of the Navy Freedom of Information Act Program.'' 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(d) 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Exemption for classified material. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
All systems of records maintained by the Department of the Navy shall be exempt under section (k)(1) of 5 U.S.C. 552a,
to the extent that the systems contains any information properly classified under E.O. 12356 and that is required
by that E.O. to be kept secret in the interest of national defense or foreign policy. This exemption is applicable to
parts of all systems of records including those not otherwise specifically designated for exemptions herein which
contain isolated items of properly classified information. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Note: Department of the Navy Privacy Act systems of records which contain classified information automatically
qualify for a (k)(1) exemption, without establishing an exemption rule.

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Exempt records in nonexempt systems.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 (1) An exemption rule applies to the system of records for which it was established. If a record from an exempt system
is incorporated intentionally into a system that has not been exempt, the published notice and rules for the nonexempt
system will apply to the record and it will not be exempt from any provisions of 5 U.S.C. 552a.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(2) A record from one component's (i.e., Department of the Navy) exempted system that is temporarily in the possession
of another component (i.e., Army) remains subject to the published system notice and rules of the originating component's
(i.e., Department of the Navy). However, if the non-originating component incorporates the record into its own system
of records, the published notice and rules for the system into which it is incorporated shall apply. If that system
of records has not been exempted, the record shall not be exempt from any provisions of 5 U.S.C. 552a.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(3) A record accidentally misfiled into a system of records is governed by the published notice and rules for the system
of records in which it actually should have been filed.

Central Intelligence Agency (CIA).
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 The Department of the Navy is not authorized to establish an exemption for records maintained by the CIA under subsection
(j)(1) of 5 U.S.C. 552a.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(2) 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Law enforcement.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 (i) The general exemption provided by subsection (j)(2) of 5 U.S.C. 552a may be established to protect criminal law
enforcement records maintained by Department of the Navy.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(ii) To be eligible for the (j)(2) exemption, the system of records must be maintained by an element that performs,
as one of its principal functions, the enforcement of criminal laws. The Naval Investigative Service, Naval Inspector
General, and military police activities qualify for this exemption.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(iii) Criminal law enforcement includes police efforts to detect, prevent, control, or reduce crime, or to apprehend
criminals, and the activities of prosecution, court, correctional, probation, pardon, or parole authorities.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(iv) Information that may be protected under the (j)(2) exemption includes:
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(A) Information compiled for the purpose of identifying criminal offenders and alleged criminal offenders consisting
of only identifying data and notations of arrests; the nature and disposition of criminal charges; and sentencing,
confinement, release, parole, and probation status;
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(B) Information compiled for the purpose of a criminal investigation, including reports of informants and investigators,
and associated with an identifiable individual; and
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(C) Reports identifiable to an individual, compiled at any stage of the enforcement process, from arrest, apprehension,
indictment, or preferral of charges through final release from the supervision that resulted from the commission
of a crime.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(v) The (j)(2) exemption does not apply to:
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(A) Investigative records maintained by a naval activity having no criminal law enforcement duties as one of its principle
functions, or
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(B) Investigative records compiled by any element concerning individual's suitability, eligibility, or qualification
for duty, employment, or access to classified information, regardless of the principle functions of the naval activity
that compiled them. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(vi) The (j)(2) exemption established for a system of records maintained by a criminal law enforcement activity cannot
protect law enforcement records incorporated into a nonexempt system of records or any system of records maintained
by an activity not principally tasked with enforcing criminal laws. All system managers, therefore, are cautioned

Specific exemptions. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Specific exemptions permit certain categories of records to be exempted from specific provisions of 5 U.S.C. 552a.
Subsections (k)(1)-(7) of 5 U.S.C. 552a allow exemptions for seven categories of records. To be eligible for a specific
exemption, the record must meet the corresponding criteria. Note: Department of the Navy Privacy Act systems of records
which contain classified information automatically qualify for a (k)(1) exemption, without an established exemption
rule.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(1) (k)(1) exemption: Information properly classified under Secretary of the Navy Instruction 5720.42E, ``Department
of the Navy Freedom of Information Act Program'' and E.O. 12356, in the interest of national defense or foreign policy.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(2) (k)(2) exemption: Investigatory information (other than that information within the scope of &sect;701.113(f)(2)
compiled for law enforcement purposes. If maintaining the information causes an individual to be ineligible for
or denied any right, benefit, or privilege that he or she would otherwise be eligible for or entitled to under Federal
law, then he or she shall be given access to the information, except for the information that would identify a confidential
source (see &sect; 701.113(h), ``confidential source''). The (k)(2) exemption, when established, allows limited
protection on investigative records maintained for use in personnel and administrative actions.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(3) (k)(3) exemption: Records maintained in connection with providing protective services to the President of the
United States and other individuals under 18 U.S.C. 3056.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(4) (k)(4) exemption: Records required by Federal law to be maintained and used solely as statistical records that
are not used to make any determination about an identifiable individual, except as provided by 13 U.S.C. 8.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(5) (k)(5) exemption: Investigatory material compiled solely for the purpose of determining suitability, eligibility,
or qualifications for Federal civilian employment, military service, Federal contracts, or access to classified
information, but only to the extent such material would reveal the identity of a confidential source. (See &sect;701.113(h),
``confidential source''). This exemption allows protection of confidential sources in background investigations,
employment inquiries, and similar inquiries used in personnel screening to determine suitability, eligibility,
or qualifications.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(6) (k)(6) exemption: Testing or examination material used solely to determine individual qualifications for appointment
or promotion in the Federal or military service if the disclosure would compromise the objectivity or fairness of
the testing or examination process.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(7) (k)(7) exemption: Evaluation material used to determine potential for promotion in the military services, but
only to the extent that disclosure would reveal the identity of a confidential source. (See &sect;701.113(h), ``confidential
source''.)

(1) Denial of an amendment request. The activity head, or his or her designee wrongfully refuses the individual's
request for review of the initial denial of an amendment or, after review, wrongfully refuses to amend the record;
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(2) Denial of access. The activity wrongfully refuses to allow the individual to review the record or wrongfully denies
his or her request for a copy of the record;
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(3) Failure to meet recordkeeping standards. The activity fails to maintain an individual's record with the accuracy,
relevance, timeliness, and completeness necessary to assure fairness in any determination about the individual's
rights, benefits, or privileges and, in fact, makes an adverse determination based on the record; or
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(4) Failure to comply with Privacy Act. The activity fails to comply with any other provision of 5 U.S.C. 552a or any
rule or regulation promulgated under 5 U.S.C. 552a and thereby causes the individual to be adversely affected.

5 U.S.C. 552a and this subpart and subpart G of this part are applicable to certain types of computer matching, i.e.,
the computer comparison of automated systems of records.  There are two specific kinds of matching programs that are
fully governed by 5 U.S.C. 552a and this subpart and subpart G of this part: 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(1) Matches using records from Federal personnel or payroll systems of records;
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(2) Matches involving Federal benefit programs to accomplish one or more of the following purposes:
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(i) To determine eligibility for a Federal benefit.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(ii) To comply with benefit program requirements.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(iii) To effect recovery of improper payments or delinquent debts from current or former beneficiaries.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(b) The record comparison must be a computerized one. Manual comparisons are not covered, involving records from
two or more automated systems of records (i.e., systems of records maintained by Federal agencies that are subject
to 5 U.S.C. 552a); or a Department of the Navy automated systems of records and automated records maintained by a non-Federal
agency (i.e., State or local government or agent thereof). A covered computer matching program entails not only the
actual computerized comparison, but also preparing and executing a written agreement between the participants,
securing approval of the Defense Data Integrity Board, publishing a matching notice in the 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

Granting individuals access to portions of these records pertaining to or consisting of, but not limited to, disciplinary
reports, criminal investigations, and related statements of witnesses, and such other related matter in conjunction
with the enforcement of criminal laws, could interfere with the orderly investigations, with the orderly administration
of justice, and possibly enable suspects to avoid detection or apprehension. Disclosure of this information could
result in the concealment, destruction, or fabrication of evidence, and jeopardize the safety and well-being of
informants, witnesses and their families, and law enforcement personnel and their families. Disclosure of this
information could also reveal and render ineffectual investigative techniques, sources, and methods used by these
components and could result in the invasion of the privacy of individuals only incidentally related to an investigation.
The exemption of the individual's right of access to portions of these records, and the reasons therefor, necessitate

Exemption is needed in order to encourage persons having knowledge of abusive or neglectful acts toward children

their right to privacy. It is essential that the identities of all individuals who furnish information under an express

criminal and civil law enforcement, as well as the release of certain disclosure accountings, could interfere with
ongoing investigations and the orderly administration of justice, in that it could result in the concealment, alteration,

charges; and could jeopardize the safety and well being of parents and their children.

Exempted portions of this system consist of information compiled for the purpose of investigations, including reports
of informants and investigators. Such investigations may be associated with identifiable individuals. Disclosure
of files in this system would interfere with orderly investigations, and possibly result in the concealment, destruction,
or fabrication of evidence, and possibly jeopardize the safety and well-being of informants, witnesses and their
families. Such disclosures could also reveal and render ineffectual investigatory techniques and methods and sources
of information and could further result in the invasion of the personal privacy of individuals only incidentally
related to an investigation. Depending on the nature of the complaint, records may contain information that: is currently
and properly classified pursuant to E.O. and must be kept secret in the interest of national defense or foreign policy,
is confidentially provided information located in investigatory records compiled for the purposed of enforcement
of non-criminal law, relates to qualifications, eligibility, or suitability for Federal employment, is test or
examination material used to determine qualifications for appointment or promotion in the Federal service, is confidentially
provided information used to determine potential for promotion in the armed services.

Granting individuals access to information collected and maintained by this activity relating to the enforcement
of criminal laws could interfere with the orderly investigations, with the orderly administration of justice, and
possibly enable suspects to avoid detection or apprehension. Disclosure of this information could result in the
concealment, destruction, or fabrication of evidence, and jeopardize the safety and well-being of informants,
witnesses and their families, and law enforcement personnel and their families. Disclosure of this information
could also reveal and render ineffectual investigative techniques, sources, and methods used by these components
and could result in the invasion of the privacy of individuals only incidentally related to an investigation. The
exemption of the individual's right of access to portions of these records, and the reasons therefor, necessitate

The release of disclosure accountings would permit the subject of an investigation to obtain valuable information
concerning the nature of that investigation, and the information contained, or the identity of witnesses or informants,
would therefor present a serious impediment to law enforcement. In addition, disclosure of the accounting would
amount to notice to the individual of the existence of a record. Access to the records contained in this system would
inform the subject of the existence of material compiled for law enforcement purposes, the premature release of which
could prevent the successful completion of investigation, and lead to the improper influencing of witnesses, the
destruction of records, or the fabrication of testimony. Exempt portions of this system also contain information
that has been properly classified under E.O. 12356, and that is required to be kept secret in the interest of national
defense or foreign policy.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Exempt portions of this system also contain information considered relevant and necessary to make a determination
as to qualifications, eligibility, or suitability for Federal civilian employment, military service, Federal

published in the 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 in broad generic terms. The identity of specific sources, however, must be withheld in order to protect the confidentiality
of the source, of criminal and other law enforcement information. This exemption is further necessary to protect
the privacy and physical safety of witnesses and informants.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
This system of records is exempted from procedures for notice to an individual as to the existence of records pertaining
to him/her dealing with an actual or potential civil or regulatory investigation, because such notice to an individual
would be detrimental to the successful conduct and/or completion of an investigation, pending or future. Mere notice
of the fact of an investigation could inform the subject or others that their activities are under, or may become the
subject of, an investigation. This could enable the subjects to avoid detection, to influence witnesses improperly,
to destroy records, or to fabricate testimony.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Exempt portions of this system containing screening board reports. Screening board reports set forth the results
of oral examination of applicants for a position as a special agent with the Naval Investigation Service Command.
Disclosure of these records would reveal the areas pursued in the course of the examination and thus adversely affect
the result of the selection process. Equally important, the records contain the candid views of the members composing
the board. Release of the records could affect the willingness of the members to provide candid opinions and thus diminish
the effectiveness of a program which is essential to maintaining the high standard of the Special Agent Corps., i.e.,
those records constituting examination material used solely to determine individual qualifications for appointment
in the Federal service.

Subsection (d) because granting individuals access to information relating to the preparation and conduct of litigation
would impair the development and implementation of legal strategy. Accordingly, such records are exempt under the
attorney-client privilege. Disclosure might also compromise on-going investigations and reveal confidential
informants. Additionally, granting access to the record subject would seriously impair the Navy's ability to negotiate
settlements or pursue other civil remedies. Amendment is inappropriate because the litigation files contain official
records including transcripts, court orders, investigatory materials, evidentiary materials such as exhibits,
decisional memorandum and other case-related papers. Administrative due process could not be achieved by the ``exparte''
correction of such materials.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Subsection (e)(1) because it is not possible in all instances to determine relevancy or necessity of specific information
in the early stages of case development. What appeared relevant and necessary when collected, ultimately may be deemed

investigations which is not used during subject case is often retained to provide leads in other cases or to establish
patterns of activity.

Exemption is needed in order to encourage persons having knowledge of abusive or neglectful acts toward children

criminal and civil law enforcement, as well as the release of certain disclosure accounting, could interfere with
ongoing investigations and the orderly administration of justice, in that it could result in the concealment, alteration,

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Granting individuals access to information collected and maintained by these activities relating to the enforcement
of criminal laws could interfere with orderly investigations, with the orderly administration of justice, and might
enable suspects to avoid detection or apprehension. Disclosure of this information could result in the concealment,
destruction, or fabrication of evidence, and jeopardize the safety and well being of informants, witnesses and their
families, and law enforcement personnel and their families. Disclosure of this information could also reveal and
render ineffectual investigative techniques, sources, and methods used by this component, and could result in the
invasion of the privacy of individuals only incidentally related to an investigation. The exemption of the individual's
right of access to his or her records, and the reasons therefore, necessitate the exemption of this system of records
from the requirements of other cited provisions.
