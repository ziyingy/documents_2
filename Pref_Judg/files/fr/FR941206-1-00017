As previously indicated, FSIS believes that MS(K) differs sufficiently from boneless poultry products produced
by traditional hand-deboning techniques that it should be regulated as separate, standardized ingredients. FSIS
is aware that other descriptions have been associated with poultry products produced by mechanically separation.
In addition to the use of terminology such as ``finely comminuted'' poultry to specify the form of the product and ``mechanically
deboned'' poultry, such product has been referred to as ``mechanically separated' poultry within the meat and poultry
industries. FSIS believes that where a distinguishing characteristic of a standardized product is, its bone solids
content, it would be inappropriate to define it by a name that includes the term ``deboned'' and use of this term in labeling
might mislead consumers by implying such product contains no bone. FSIS will, however, welcome comments on other
names that accurately reflect the process from which this product is derived, as well as its form and consistency.

Bone solids content.

 FSIS is proposing that the definition and standard for MS(K) incorporate the existing restriction on the bone solids
content of mechanically separated poultry products of not more than 1 percent (9 CFR 381.117(d)). Because this restriction
is enforced by measuring calcium content, FSIS believes the definition and standard for MS(K) should include maximum
calcium content levels of not more than 0.235 percent in product made from turkeys or mature chickens or 0.175 percent
in product made from other poultry, as a measure of bone solids content based on the weight of product that has not been
heat treated.

As previously discussed, FSIS adopted the 1 percent bone solids restriction after appraising the operating results
in a series of poultry establishments using mechanical deboning equipment, analyzing 485 samples of raw product,
and concluding that existing equipment can be operated under commercial conditions to produce product which meets
this limit (34 FR 13991). When processors applied the mechanical deboning technology to poultry products such as
fowl frames that had been heat treated using various cooking methods, FSIS modified its procedures to take into account
weight loss that can occur with cooking. Thus, the practice has been to permit an allowance for weight loss in order
to reflect the bone solids content that would have been present if heat treatment had not occurred; and the adjusted
level may not exceed 1 percent. The ``Chemistry Laboratory Guidebook,'' U.S. Department of Agriculture (section
6.010F, page 6&hyph;33),

 currently includes procedures for different degrees of adjustment depending on whether conventional cooking methods
(i.e., open kettle) or other heat treatment (e.g., pressure cooking) are used.

After evaluating data on substances of potential concern that may tend to concentrate in bone, the 1979 report on health
and safety aspects of the use of mechanically deboned poultry did not recommend any change in the existing bone solids
limit. Because enforcement is based on calcium content analyses; however, rather than direct measurements of bone
solids, FSIS believes that an amended poultry products inspection regulation should include the maximum amount
of calcium permitted in determining whether mechanically separated poultry is in compliance.

FSIS has developed two different calcium content levels for this purpose. Both of these levels account for the fact
that poultry tissues, other than bone, contain some calcium. The higher level_0.235 percent_reflects the greater
proportion of calcium in the bones of mature chickens and turkeys as compared with young chickens (i.e., the lower
ratio of bone solids to calcium). The lower level_0.175 percent_has been used by FSIS in enforcing the 1 percent restriction
on product made from young chickens. Both of these calcium levels are equivalent to 1 percent bone solids using the
conversion formulas for calculating bone solids from calcium on a weight basis.

The formula for calculating bone solids from calcium for poultry products is in the ``Chemistry Laboratory Guidebook,''
U.S. Department of Agriculture (6.010F, page 6&hyph;33), and is available for public inspection at the FSIS Docket
Clerk's office.

Since FSIS is proposing a definition and standard that includes potential types of mechanically separated product,
FSIS would allow 0.175 percent calcium as the maximum for all MS(K) that is made from poultry other than turkeys or mature
chickens. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The inclusion of these calcium content levels in the proposed definition and standard should not be misinterpreted
as indicating a concern about the amount of the essential nutrient calcium that is provided by poultry and meat food
products. FSIS agrees with the findings in the 1979 health and safety report that, even assuming all further processed
poultry were made with mechanically deboned poultry (i.e., a far greater level of production and use than actually
occurs), the projected calcium contribution of such products would represent only a negligible increase in per capita
daily intakes and cannot be considered hazardous, particularly since the dietary intake of a large sector of the population
may be below the recommended level of calcium consumption.
