Even in the very unrealistic scenario of South Korea's exports of eggplant being fully diverted to the United States,
the quantities would not be large enough to affect the U.S. market.

Kiwi 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
This proposed rule would allow kiwi to be imported into the United States from South Korea under certain conditions.
Utilized U.S. production of kiwi in 1992 totaled 47,700 mt. Imports of kiwi into the United States for 1992 were estimated
at 20,236 mt, or more than 40 percent of domestic production. South Korea's annual production of kiwi in 1993 totaled
8,538 mt, of which none was exported. Assuming 5 percent of South Korea's production (426.9 mt) were exported to the
United States, this amount would represent only about 0.6 percent of U.S. supply (produced domestically and imported)
in 1991.

Lettuce 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
This proposed rule would allow lettuce to be imported into the United States from Israel and South Korea under certain
conditions. Total U.S. production of head, leaf, and romaine lettuce in 1993 was 82,790,000 cwt (3,755,330 mt). In
Israel, insect-free lettuce produced in greenhouses for the 1993/94 season reached about 4,480,000 pounds. Exports
planned for 1994/95 are estimated at 1,600,000 pounds. If all of these exports were destined for the United States,
they would comprise less than 0.02 percent of U.S. production and, therefore, would not noticeably affect the U.S.
market. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
South Korea's annual production of leaf lettuce in 1993 totaled 149,611 mt, of which 23.9 mt were exported to Japan,
Guam, Hong Kong, and Saipan. If all of South Korea's lettuce exports were sent to the United States, it would represent
only about 0.0006 percent of U.S. production.

Impacts on U.S. producers for several of the other commodities that could be imported into the United States under
this proposal could not be assessed because of a lack of data. However, none of these products is a significant U.S.
crop. The herbs, in particular, are often grown to supplement other farm income. Others, such as arugula and lambs
quarters, have limited markets. APHIS anticipates, therefore, that no significant economic impacts would result
from the importation of these commodities for which analysis has not been possible. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The aggregate economic impact of this proposed rule is expected to be positive. U.S. consumers would benefit from
a greater availability of fruits and vegetables. U.S. importers would also benefit from a greater availability of
fruits and vegetables to import. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The alternative to this proposed rule was to make no changes in the fruits and vegetables regulations. After consideration,
we rejected this alternative since there was no pest risk reason to maintain the prohibitions on the affected produce.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
This proposed rule contains no paperwork or recordkeeping requirements.

Executive Order 12778 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
This proposed rule would allow certain fruits and vegetables to be imported into the United States from certain parts
of the world. If this proposed rule is adopted, State and local laws and regulations regarding the importation of fruits
and vegetables under this rule would be preempted while the fruits and vegetables are in foreign commerce. Fresh fruits
and vegetables are generally imported for immediate distribution and sale to the consuming public, and would remain
in foreign commerce until sold to the ultimate consumer. The question of when foreign commerce ceases in other cases
must be addressed on a case-by-case basis. If this proposed rule is adopted, no retroactive effect will be given to
this rule, and this rule will not require administrative proceedings before parties may file suit in court challenging
this rule.

National Environmental Policy Act

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
An environmental assessment and finding of no significant impact have been prepared for this proposed rule. The assessment
provides a basis for the conclusion that the importation of fruits and vegetables under the conditions specified
in this proposed rule would not present a significant risk of introducing or disseminating plant pests and would not
have a significant impact on the quality of the human environment. Based on the finding of no significant impact, the
Administrator of the Animal and Plant Health Inspection Service has determined that an environmental impact statement
need not be prepared. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The environmental assessment and finding of no significant impact were prepared in accordance with: (1) The National
Environmental Policy Act of 1969 (NEPA) (42 U.S.C. 4321
