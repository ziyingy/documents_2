Pollution prevention is an important aspect of sediment 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
management, as it is for most environmental issues. A variety of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
federal, state, and local pollution prevention efforts are underway 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
that should result in long-term reductions in the degree to which 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
sediments become contaminated. However, sediments also act as ``sinks'' 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
for contaminants discharged in the past, and dredging projects by 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
their very nature can expose this historic contamination. Therefore 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
pollution prevention efforts in the foreseeable future are not 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
expected to eliminate the dredging of contaminated sediments. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Finally, there is no need to systematically tighten ocean suitability 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
criteria because existing criteria do not allow toxic or highly 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
contaminated sediments to be disposed at the site (suitability 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
criteria are not tied to existing levels of contamination in area 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
sediments).

Two commentors 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
disagreed with EPA's determination that the regulatory requirements of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the MPRSA were fully satisfied by the proposed site designation, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
particularly regarding the assessment of impacts to existing and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
potential fisheries, fish habitat and marine sanctuaries. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
EPA's determination of insignificant impacts to fisheries 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
used conservative modelling of the worst case (highly dispersive) 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
disposal scenarios. The evaluation indicated only localized impacts 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
within the disposal site boundaries, based on: the highly mobile 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
nature of the fish species present; the fact that the disposal site 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
has relatively low abundances of commercially important fish species; 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
and the fact that the site does not comprise unique fish habitat 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
within the slope and shelf region. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
With respect to impacts to marine sanctuaries, the Final EIS 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
documented that the expected increase in vessel traffic and resultant 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
increased chance for accidents (
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
i.e., 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
dredged material spills) during 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
transportation through the sanctuaries will not be significant. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Nevertheless, specific requirements to minimize any such risks are 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
incorporated in the Final Rule.

Several 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
commentors were concerned that the Proposed Rule did not clearly state 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
that implementation of the site management and monitoring provisions 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
is a strict condition for site use. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

Response
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
EPA intends that full implementation of the SMMP is a 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
strict requirement of site use, and revisions have been be 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
incorporated into the Final Rule to emphasize this and remove any 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
ambiguity.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Several commentors stated 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
that they were not satisfied that the SMMP as summarized in the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Proposed Rule accounts for risks associated with a site which is the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
deepest and farthest from shore of any so far designated in the U.S., 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
or that there is sufficient information on how dredged material will 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
behave following disposal at such a deep site. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=81 g=1 f=1 -->
Response

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
EPA recognizes that the proposed SF&hyph;DODS, as well as the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
potential alternative ocean sites evaluated in the Final EIS, is the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
deepest and the farthest from shore of any ocean disposal site so far 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
designated in the U.S. However, EPA has expended considerable effort 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
to adequately characterize this previously not well-studied region of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the California coast. Studies were conducted in accordance with an 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Ocean Studies Plan which was developed with input from Federal and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
State agencies as well as environmental and public interest groups. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Because of the deep depths and distance from shore, EPA performed 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
conservative (worst case) modeling to assess the fate of dredged 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
material disposal at the alternative sites. The modeling results 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
indicate that the bulk (75 to 90 percent) of the dredged material 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
would be deposited on the seafloor within the disposal site 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
boundaries, and that residual suspended material in the water column 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
would be dissipated to background concentration levels within the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
disposal site boundaries, as well. These modeling predictions were 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
confirmed by recent monitoring of actual dredged material disposal in 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the vicinity of the SF&hyph;DODS by the U.S. Navy, performed as a 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
requirement of their MPRSA Section 103 project-specific site 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
designation. Preliminary results of their field studies confirmed 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
that plumes in the water column could be tracked until they dissipated 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
to background levels, and that the plumes dissipated to background 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
levels within the disposal site boundaries. Furthermore, their 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
findings confirmed that the sediment deposit footprint on the seafloor 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
could be mapped, and that the sediment deposited within the disposal 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
site boundary as predicted by the modeling performed for EPA's site 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
designation EIS. Finally, the SMMP was developed to address the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
uncertainties and risks associated with use of this disposal site.

8. Impacts to Nearby Marine Sanctuaries

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
One commentor stated that 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
past disposal of chemical munitions, explosives, radioactive 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
materials, sulfuric acid, and oil refinery waste at the site or nearby 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
locations does not justify designating a disposal site near federally 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
protected marine sanctuaries such as the Gulf of the Farallones 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
National Marine Sanctuary and the Monterey Bay National Marine 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Sanctuary.

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
National marine sanctuaries are continuous along the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
coastline of the study region. The ocean disposal site is located off 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the continental shelf, at the extreme point of the Zone of Siting 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Feasibility established by the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers, and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
several miles beyond the outer boundary of the nearest sanctuary. It 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
is therefore as far removed from sanctuary boundaries as practicable. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Furthermore, extensive oceanographic and modelling studies indicate 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
that suspended sediment plumes should dissipate to background levels 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
within the disposal site boundaries, and that under prevailing 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
conditions (currents predominately to the north-northwest) the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
probability of any detectable sediment plumes drifting into the marine 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
sanctuaries is extremely remote. The seafloor in the vicinity of the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
site has already been somewhat degraded by historic disposal of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
military munitions and other wastes so that, compared to alternative 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
sites evaluated, cumulative effects to the deep benthos are minimized 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
at this site. Indeed, there may even be a long-term beneficial effect 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
within the disposal site as a result of cleaner (ocean suitable) 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
dredged material being deposited on a previously degraded seafloor. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Finally, designation of this site is consistent with guidance in the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Ocean Dumping Regulations [40 CFR &sect;228.5(e)] to locate disposal sites 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
beyond the continental shelf and in areas of historical dumping where 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
possible.
