<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 The proposed amendment would modify Technical Specifications (TS) 5.3.1, Fuel Assemblies, and TS 5.6.1, Criticality.
In addition, the proposed Amendment would add a new Technical Specification 3/4.9.13, Boron Concentration-Storage
Pool, and its associated BASES. This proposed amendment is requested to allow credit to be taken for burnup of spent
fuel assemblies in establishing storage locations within the PVNGS spent fuel pools.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
This amendment does not involve a significant increase in the probability or consequences of an accident previously
evaluated. Radiological consequences of the fuel handling accident are not impacted by the formation of new storage
regions since the fuel assembly design is unchanged. However, even though the probability of occurrence of a fuel
misplacement error has increased slightly, the consequences are markedly reduced by the crediting of 2150 ppm of
soluble boron in the spent fuel storage pool. The increase is also not significant because of the types of administrative
controls being put into place in Regions 2 and 3. Furthermore, a fuel assembly misplacement error is not considered
an accident, as defined in the UFSAR.

 The proposed amendments would revise Technical Specification 3/4.7.D, ``Primary Containment Isolation Valves.''

(1) Involve a significant increase in the probability or consequences of an accident previously evaluated because:

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The proposed license amendment adds the reference leg backfill check valves to the Technical Specifications. As
such, the proposed amendment does not change the probability nor does it change the consequences of any previously
evaluated accident for Dresden and Quad Cities Stations. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The proposed modifications (and proposed Technical Specification amendments) add reference leg backfill instrument
lines and check valves to the reactor vessel level instrumentation. The proposed modifications will eliminate the
phenomenon described in IEB 93&hyph;03 (dissolved gases in the [Reactor Vessel Instrumentation System] RVLIS piping
may produce uncertainties in the level instrumentation during RPV depressurization) by providing degassed Control
Rod Drive (CRD) water to the RVLIS reference leg piping. The proposed design ensures that a continuous column of water,
free of non-condensible gases is maintained in the RVLIS reference leg piping. As such, the proposed modifications
do not affect any accident precursors or initiators. Therefore the proposed modifications for the reference leg
backfill instrument lines do not increase the probability of any previously evaluated accidents for Dresden Station
and Quad Cities Station.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG /STAG -->

<!-- PJG STAG 4703 -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->
The proposed plant modifications for the reference leg backfill check valves will not increase the radiological
consequences of any previously evaluated accident. The radiological impact from a reference leg backfill instrument
line break is bounded by Dresden's and Quad Cities' Instrument Line Break analysis (UFSAR Section 15.6.2). Therefore,
the proposed plant changes will not increase the consequences of any previously evaluated accident. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(2) Create the possibility of a new or different kind of accident from any accident previously evaluated because:

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The proposed modification connects the non-safety-related CRD system to each safety-related division of RPV instrumentation
and Feedwater Level Control System. The backfill check valves will eliminate the potential for reference leg leakage
if CRD piping integrity is lost. These check valves are classified as safety-related and will be maintained and controlled
such that overall plant safety is maintained. The addition of the reference leg backfill check valves to the Technical
Specifications does not create the possibility of a new or different kind of accident for Dresden Station or Quad Cities
Station. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(3) Involve a significant reduction in the margin of safety because: 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Primary containment integrity is not compromised by the addition of a pair of check valves that provide isolation
for the reference leg backfill lines. These valves have been demonstrated to meet the intent of the criteria specified
in General Design Criterion (GDC) 55. The maintenance and control applied toward all the reference leg backfill check
valves ensures that overall plant safety is maintained. Therefore, the addition of the reference leg backfill valves
to Technical Specification 3.7.D.1 and 3.7.D.2 does not reduce the margin of safety for Dresden Station or Quad Cities
Station.

 The proposed amendments would revise Technical Specification 3/4.6 for Dresden and Quad Cities Stations to allow
Single Loop Operation (SLO) with the recirculation loop suction and discharge valves open. The amendments would

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->
Commonwealth Edison has evaluated this proposed amendment and determined that it involves no significant hazards
considerations. According to 10 CFR 50.92(c), a proposed amendment to an operating license involves no significant
hazards considerations if operation of the facility in accordance with the proposed amendment would not: 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
1. Involve a significant increase in the probability or consequences of an accident previously evaluated; or 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

3. Involve a significant reduction in a margin of safety. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=3 -->
The proposed changes do not involve a significant increase in the probability or consequences of an accident previously
evaluated because:
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->
 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The proposed change to delete the requirement to close the suction valve of the idle loop during SLO potentially affects
two transient or accident analysis previously evaluated. The first is the Loss-of-Coolant Accident (LOCA) which
has been analyzed for the full range of break sizes, from a small rupture, where the makeup flow is greater than the coolant
loss rate, to the largest, a highly improbable circumferential recirculation line break. The design basis LOCA at
Dresden and Quad Cities is the double-ended guillotine break in a recirculation line. LPCI is one of the Emergency
Core Cooling Systems that would be initiated to flood the core following the Design Basis LOCA accident. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The LOCA analysis for Quad Cities, Units 1 and 2, takes no credit for closure of the recirculation suction valve to properly
direct LPCI flow into the lower plenum of the reactor. Instead, the LPCI loop selection logic is relied upon to automatically
close the recirculation discharge valve of the selected intact loop. For Dresden, Units 2 and 3, LPCI is not credited
to inject because the limiting failure is the LPCI injection valve. The LOCA ECCS analyses previously performed for
SLO remain applicable and the severity of a postulated LOCA event has not increased. The proposed changes do not physically
change the plant in any manner that would increase the probability of a LOCA. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The second transient considered is the inadvertent startup of an idle recirculation pump in an unisolated loop. This
event is precluded, however, when the loop is unisolated because the discharge valve must be closed for the pump to
start. To further decrease the probability of the occurrence of this transient, Section 3.6.H.3.e is added to require
the pump to be electrically prohibited from starting. In addition, leaving the loop unisolated results in an increase
in the temperature of the water in the loop, and a correspondingly lower reactivity insertion should the transient
occur. For these reasons, neither the probability nor the consequences of an inadvertent idle pump start have increased.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The additional requirements introduced in Section 3.6.H.5.a-b and 4.6.H.5 to monitor temperatures between the
two loops and the reactor coolant do not cause an increase in the probability or consequences of an accident because
they limit stresses in the vessel and primary piping system to acceptable levels. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The procedures that are currently followed at Dresden, Units 2 and 3, regarding inadvertent entrance into a region
of instability, defined as Region A, B, and C in Reference (e), are more conservative than those recommended by the
NRC Bulletin, and do not allow operation in the stability regions defined in the Dresden Technical Specifications.
Removing Sections 3.6.H.3.b-c and Section 4.6.H.3 only removes outdated material from the Dresden Technical Specifications
and does not increase the probability or consequences of an accident previously evaluated. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The removal of Section 3.6.H.4 allowing operation without forced circulation below 25% of rated power at Dresden,
Units 2 and 3, will not increase the probability or consequences of an accident previously evaluated. This change
is conservative because it will prohibit operation in a condition susceptible to instabilities. This section also
is not included in the Standard Technical Specifications. In the same manner, Section 2.1.A.4 is removed from the
Quad Cities Technical Specifications.

<!-- PJG STAG 4703 -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->
The removal of Section 3.6.H.3.a from the Dresden Technical Specifications will not increase the probability or
consequences of an accident, because a one-pump run-up transient is bounded by the two-pump run-up transient. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The change in initiation time for SLO requirements for Quad Cities from 12 hours to 24 hours does not represent a significant
change, and still allows adequate time to implement the requirements. Therefore, no increase in the probability
or consequences of an accident will be caused by this change. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
For the reasons stated above, no increase in the probability or consequences of an accident previously evaluated
is introduced by the proposed changes. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=3 -->
The proposed changes do not create the possibility of a new or different kind of accident from any accident previously

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->
 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The proposed change to eliminate the requirement to close the recirculation suction valve of the idle recirculation
loop during SLO only removes unnecessary conservatism which is not required to ensure proper LPCI injection into
the vessel during a LOCA. The LPCI loop selection logic already ensures that the intact loop's recirculation pump
discharge valves will close when selected for LPCI injection. Since all ECCS functions will continue to perform as
designed, no new accident scenarios are created. Also, by requiring the idle loop to be electrically prohibited from
starting, the possibility of a new event is not created. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Section 3.6.H.5.a-b and 4.6.H.5 provide for temperature monitoring prior to starting an idle pump, and monitoring
to maintain acceptable primary system stress levels. Since the changes [do] not adversely affect the performance
of any safety related systems, no new accident scenarios are created. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The change eliminating the requirements for actions when a region of instability is entered during SLO will not create
a new or different type of accident because procedures are already in place that are consistent with NRC guidance in
this area. These procedures are more conservative than the current Technical Specifications. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The removal of Section 3.6.H.4 (Dresden) and Section 2.1.A.4 (Quad Cities) does not create the possibility of a new
or different kind of accident because the units will not be allowed to operate without forced circulation with these
sections removed, and Section 3.6.H.4 added. The possibility of accidents occurring from operating in this mode
has been eliminated, and no new types of accidents are created. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
There is no possibility of a new type of accident being created from the removal of Section 3.6.H.3.a from the Dresden
Technical Specifications. The analysis behind the reduced flow MCPR curves provides more thermal margin during
SLO than two-loop operation, because the one-pump run-up transient is less severe than the two-pump run-up transient.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The speed requirement change (Section 3.6.H.3.d for Dresden) for the operating recirculation pump prior to idle
loop startup is in a conservative direction, and no new types of accidents are created. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The increase in allowed time to initiate SLO requirements for Quad Cities (Section 2.1.A.4) does not represent a significant
change, and still allows adequate time to implement necessary requirements. No new types of accidents are created
by this change. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=3 -->
The proposed changes do not involve a significant reduction in a margin of safety because:
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->
 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The change to eliminate the requirements to close the recirculation suction valves of the idle loop during SLO maintains
the assumptions of the LOCA analyses. The LPCI loop selection logic will automatically close the recirculation pump
discharge valve of the unbroken loop to ensure proper LPCI injection. Therefore, the current MAPLHGR limits at Dresden
and Quad Cities will continue to ensure that Appendix K criteria are satisfied. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
During normal dual loop operation, LPCI loop selection logic is relied upon to close the discharge valve of the unbroken
loop following a LOCA. This function is performed during SLO, provided the discharge valve and the logic that automatically
closes this valve upon the occurrence of a LOCA signal remain operable. Since the assumptions of the accident analysis
are preserved by the proposed change, there is no reduction in any safety margin. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The safeguards in place preventing the inadvertent start of an idle recirculation pump are more than adequate protection
against this transient. Three concurrent failures are required for this transient to occur. The transient would
also be less severe due to the warmer water in the loop. Therefore, no reduction in a margin of safety will occur with
this change. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The addition of Sections 3.6.H.5.a-b and 4.6.H.5 will not decrease margin to safety, since the temperature monitoring
requirements will maintain acceptable stresses in the primary system during idle pump starts. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
For Dresden, the current procedures for entrance into a region of stability provide more margin to safety than the
current Technical Specifications require, because operation in a stability region is not allowed. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The elimination of Section 3.6.H.4 in the Dresden Technical Specifications and Section 2.1.A.4 in the Quad Cities
Technical Specifications will not decrease a margin of safety because it prohibits operations in a potentially unstable
region. This change is in a conservative direction. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The elimination of Section 3.6.H.3.a in the Dresden Technical Specifications does not cause a decrease in margin
to safety, because there is more thermal margin to SLO than two-loop operation. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Changing the active loop speed requirement from 65% to 43% prior to idle loop startup for Dresden is in the conservative
direction; therefore, margin to safety is increased. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The increase in allowed time to initiate SLO requirements for Quad Cities still provides adequate time to implement
these requirements, and is not a significant change. Margin to safety is not decreased by this change. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Margin of safety does not, therefore, decrease due to the proposed Technical Specification amendment.

Description of amendment requests:
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 The proposed amendments would provide surveillance requirements for new hydraulic snubbers, which will be installed
on the Main Steam Lines (MSLs) during the current Unit 1 refueling outage. This outage began on March 13, 1994, and it
is scheduled to end on July 3, 1994. These snubbers will also be installed on Unit 2 during the Unit 2 refuel outage (Q2R13)
currently scheduled for the first quarter of 1995. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The amendment request would also change the Snubber Visual Inspection Intervals and Corrective Actions in Technical
Specifications Sections 3.6.1 and 4.6.1 to the format and content of the BWR Standardized Technical Specifications
(STS), as revised by the provisions of Generic Letter (GL) 84&hyph;13 ``Technical Specification for Snubbers'',
dated May 3, 1984 and GL 90&hyph;09 ``Alternative Requirements for Snubber Visual Inspection Intervals and Corrective
Actions'', dated December 11, 1990.

Basis for proposed no significant hazards consideration determination: 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
As required by 10 CFR 50.91(a), the licensee has provided its analysis of the issue of no significant hazards consideration,
which is presented below:

<!-- PJG QTAG 04 -->
<!-- PJG /QTAG -->
 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->
Commonwealth Edison Company has evaluated the proposed Technical Specification Amendment and determined that
it does not represent a significant hazards consideration. Based on the criteria for defining a significant hazards
consideration established in 10 CFR 50.92, operation of Quad Cities Station Units 1 and 2 (Quad Cities) in accordance
with the proposed amendment will not: 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(1) Involve a significant increase in the probability or consequences of an accident previously evaluated because:

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The proposed changes adopt the format and content of the BWR-STS, as modified by the provisions of GL 84&hyph;13 and
GL 90&hyph;09. As such, these proposed changes are administrative in nature and have no effect on the accident analyses
or system operation. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The proposed schedule for snubber visual inspection intervals described in GL 90&hyph;09 will maintain the same
level of confidence as the existing schedule as documented in Generic Letter 90&hyph;09, Alternative Requirements
for Snubber Visual Inspection Intervals and Corrective Actions, dated December 11, 1990. Also, the surveillance
requirement and schedule for snubber functional testing remains the same providing a 95 percent confidence level
that 90 to 100 percent of the snubbers operate within the specified limits. The proposed visual inspection schedule
is separate from functional testing and adds to the confidence level that the installed snubbers will serve their
design function and are being maintained operable. Accident analyses assume that snubbers are initially operable.
Compliance with the Technical Specification Surveillance Requirements for functional testing in conjunction
with the revised visual inspection schedule assures continued operability of the snubbers. Therefore, no initial
assumptions are being changed and thus neither the probability nor consequences of any accidents previously evaluated
are significantly increased. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(2) Create the possibility of a new or different kind of accident from any accident previously evaluated because:

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The proposed changes adopt the format and content of the BWR-STS, as modified by the provisions of GL 84&hyph;13 and
GL 90&hyph;09. As such, these proposed changes are administrative in nature and have no effect on the accident analyses
or system operation. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The proposed schedule for snubber visual inspection intervals will maintain the same level of confidence as the existing
schedule as documented in Generic Letter 90&hyph;09, Alternative Requirements for Snubber Visual Inspection Intervals
and Corrective Actions, dated December 11, 1990. Also, the surveillance requirement and schedule for snubber function
testing remains the same providing a 95 percent confidence level that 90 to 100 percent of the snubbers operate within
the specified limits. The proposed visual inspection schedule is separate from functional testing and adds to the
confidence level that the installed snubbers will serve their design function and are being maintained operable.
As a result, the supported piping, components, etc. will be maintained operable, so that supported safety systems
will perform as designed. Therefore, the possibility of a new or different kind of accident is not created. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(3) Involve a significant reduction in the margin of safety because: 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The proposed changes adopt the format and content of the BWR-STS, as modified by the provisions of GL 84&hyph;13 and
G[L] 90&hyph;09. As such, these proposed changes are administrative in nature and have no effect on the accident analyses
or system operation. In addition, the proposed amendment maintains the same level of confidence as the current technical
specification that snubbers are operable through the current snubber functional testing and the revised snubber
visual inspection

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG QTAG 04 -->
<!-- PJG /QTAG -->
 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->
The proposed changes do not involve an SHC [significant hazards consideration] because the changes would not: 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
1. Involve a significant increase in the probability or consequences of an accident previously evaluated. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The ultimate heat sink (Connecticut River) provides the cooling water necessary to ensure the removal of the normal
heat loads and normal cooldown loads of the plant and to mitigate the effects of accidents at the plant within acceptable
limits. By placing a technical specification limit on the maximum temperature of the ultimate heat sink for plant
operation, CYAPCO will assure that sufficient heat removal capacity is available. The intake structure draws water
from the ultimate heat sink for circulation by the service water system and circulating water system. By adding this
new requirement to the technical specifications, CYAPCO will ensure that the design basis, as stated in the Final
Safety Analysis Report, for the ultimate heat sink is not violated. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The change does not affect any initiating event. Thus, the change does not affect the probability of occurrence of
any design basis accidents previously evaluated. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
There are no adverse impacts on the design basis accidents due to the addition of the ultimate heat sink temperature
limitation. This administrative change has no effect on the consequences of the previously evaluated accidents.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
2. Create the possibility of a new or different kind of accident from any previously analyzed. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Currently, the Haddam Neck Plant controls the ultimate heat sink temperature limit to less than 90
<!-- PJG 0017 degreeslatlong -->
&cir;F for Mode 1, 2, 3, and 4 via a plant procedure. The proposed change institutes a technical specification in place
of this administrative control. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
As such, the administrative change is consistent with the current plant practice and has no effect on plant operation.
Since there are no changes in the way the plant is operated, there is no possibility of an accident of a different type
than previously evaluated due to the change. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
3. Involve a reduction in a margin of safety. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The proposed change does not impact the physical protective boundaries, nor does it affect the performance of safety
systems. There is no degradation in operability and surveillance requirements for the ultimate heat sink. Therefore,
there will be no adverse impact on the margin of safety as defined in the basis for any technical specifications.

Description of amendment request:

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 This amendment request is an additional followup to the amendment request of May 29, 1992, published in the 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 -->
Federal Register
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

 on July 8, 1992, (57 FR 30242) which changed the Technical Specifications Section 1.0, Definitions, to accommodate
a 24-month fuel cycle and which proposed the extension of the test intervals for specific surveillance tests. This
amendment proposes extending the surveillance intervals to 24 months for leak testing containment isolation valves.
The changes requested by the licensee are in accordance with Generic Letter 91&hyph;04, ``Changes in Technical Specification
Intervals to Accommodate a 24&hyph;Month Fuel Cycle.'' In addition, the request corrects an administrative error.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->
1. A significant increase in the probability or consequences of an accident previously evaluated will not occur.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
It is proposed that the interval between leakage tests of the containment isolation valves listed in the Technical
Specifications be revised from 24 months to 24 months (+25%), consistent with an exemption request to 10 CFR [Part]
50 Appendix J for type C tests which requests an identical extension in the interval between tests. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The proposed changes do not involve a significant increase in the probability or consequences of a previously analyzed
accident. These changes propose extending the surveillance intervals for containment leakage testing. The changes
do not involve any physical changes to the plant or alter the way equipment functions. Other system testing (e.g.,
on-line tests) provides assurance of system operability. An evaluation of past equipment performance provides
additional assurance that the longer surveillance intervals will not degrade system performance. The 25% increase
in the surveillance interval for type C leak rate testing is compensated for by a proportionate increase in the margin
between specified leakage limit and the allowable leakage limit. Valves that are sealed with fluid are exempted from
the 10 CFR [Part] 50, Appendix J leakage requirements. The Technical Specifications establish separate acceptance
criteria for such cases base[d] on system design considerations. Additionally, in most cases, containment isolation
valve redundancy (two valves in series) provides additional assurance that actual leakage would be lower than the
test results would indicate. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
2. The possibility of a new or different kind of accident from any accident previously evaluated has not been created.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The proposed license amendment does not create the possibility of a new or different kind of accident. These changes
propose extending the surveillance intervals for containment leakage testing. The changes do not involve any physical
changes to the plant or alter the way equipment functions. Other system testing (e.g., on-line tests) provides assurance
of system operability. An evaluation of past equipment performance provides additional assurance that the longer
surveillance intervals will not degrade system performance. The 25% increase in the surveillance interval for type
C leak rate testing is compensated for by a proportionate increase in the margin between specified leakage limit and
the allowable leakage limit. Also, containment isolation valve redundancy (two valves in series) provides additional
assurance, in most cases, that leakage would be lower than the test results would indicate. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
3. Does the proposed amendment involve a significant reduction in the margin of safety? 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The proposed change[s] does[do] not involve a significant reduction in the margin of safety. These changes propose
extending the surveillance intervals for containment leakage testing. Other system testing (e.g., on-line tests)
provides assurance of system operability. An evaluation of past equipment performance provides additional assurance
that the longer surveillance intervals will not degrade system performance. The 25% increase in the surveillance
interval for type C leak rate testing is compensated for by a proportionate increase in the margin between specified
leakage limit and the allowable leakage limit. Also, containment isolation valve redundancy (two valves in series),

Description of amendment request:

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 The amendments would change the Technical Specification (TS) surveillance requirements for the emergency core
cooling system (ECCS) subsystems. Specifically, the changes would revise the minimum developed head requirement
for the centrifugal charging pumps (CCPs), the safety injection pumps (SIPs), and the residual heat removal pumps
(RHRPs); revise the sum of the minimum injection flowrates for the CCPs, SIPs, and the RHRPs; and revise the total maximum
pump flowrate (runout limit) for the CCPs and the SIPs.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->
(Amendment would not) involve a significant increase in the probability or consequences of an accident previously
evaluated. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The TS [technical specification] changes proposed by this amendment request are not considered to be initiators
of any Design Basis Accidents (DBA). During normal operation the SIPs and the RHRPs are in standby, they are not operating.
In the event of an accident resulting in an Engineered Safeguard (ES) actuation, the pumps would start to provide flow
to the reactor vessel. The minor changes proposed for these pumps (SIPs and RHRPs) would not cause any accidents or
events that have been previously evaluated. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
During normal operation, a CCP is operating. The proposed minor changes provided by this submittal only impact the
performance of these pumps in response to an ES actuation. The proposed changes do not affect, in any way, how these
pumps are operated during normal operation. As such, the minor changes proposed for the CCPs would not cause any accidents
or events that have been previously evaluated. Accordingly, the proposed TS changes would not increase the probability
of an accident that has been previously evaluated. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The purpose of the ECCS subsystem is to ensure sufficient flow is provided to the core in the event of a LOCA [loss of coolant
accident], that is to mitigate the consequences of a LOCA. A LOCA analysis was performed to determine the impact of
the proposed TS changes. The analysis was performed in accordance with the NRC approved LOCA methodology for McGuire
Nuclear Station. The results of the analysis demonstrate that the acceptance criteria of 10 CFR 50.46 are still satisfied.
Further, the purpose of the proposed TS changes are to prevent runout of the ECCS subsystem pumps during the injection
and recirculation phases of a LOCA. Accordingly, the proposed TS changes would not increase the consequences of an
accident that has been previously evaluated. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(Amendment would not) create the possibility of a new or different kind of accident from any kind of accident previously
evaluated. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The proposed TS changes would not require any modifications to any structures, systems or components at McGuire Nuclear
Station. Some minor changes to certain testing procedures for the ECCS subsystem pumps would be necessary. These
minor changes would only involve specific values identified within the procedure and would not result in any changes
on how the test would be performed. No other changes to procedures on how the station is operated or maintained would
occur. Accordingly, the proposed TS change would not create a new or different kind of accident than what has been previously
evaluated. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(Amendment would not) involve a significant reduction in a margin of safety. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The results of the analysis that was performed to determine the impact of the proposed TS changes would have in mitigating
a LOCA indicate that the acceptance criteria of 10 CFR 50.46 are still satisfied. The analysis that was performed demonstrate
that the Peak Clad Temperature (PCT) would remain below 2200
<!-- PJG 0017 degreeslatlong -->
&cir;F. The proposed changes ensure that the ECCS subsystem pumps will be operated within the limits specified by
the manufacturer. Accordingly, the proposed TS changes would not significantly reduce any margins of safety.

Description of amendment request:
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 This amendment removes restrictions from the Arkansas Nuclear One, Unit No. 1 (ANO&hyph;1) technical specifications
(TSs) that prohibit use of the auxiliary building crane to move spent fuel shipping casks.

<!-- PJG /QTAG -->
 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->
Criterion 1_Does Not Involve a Significant Increase in the Probability or Consequences of an Accident Previously
Evaluated. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The ANO procedures, load paths, crane equipment certification, operator training and other related heavy load handling
topics were evaluated as part of the control of heavy loads issue and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=53 g=1 f=1 -->
found acceptable. Spent fuel cask handling is discussed in Section 9.6.2.6 of the ANO&hyph;1 SAR [safety analysis
report], which shows that the cask will never travel over spent fuel. ANO&hyph;1 SAR Section 9.6.2.6 further evaluates
the unlikely event of a cask drop accident and shows that the consequences are acceptable. Deletion of TS 3.8.15 to
allow handling of a spent fuel shipping cask by the auxiliary building crane will have no actual impact on the cask drop
or any other previously analyzed accident and therefore, does not involve a significant increase in the probability
or consequences of any accident previously evaluated. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->
Criterion 2_Does Not Create the Possibility of a New or Different Kind of Accident from any Previously Evaluated.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The proposed amendment will allow handling of a spent fuel shipping cask by the auxiliary building crane where [sic]
previously prohibited pending NRC evaluation of the spent fuel cask drop accident and crane design. The cask handling
methods and cask drop accident are discussed and evaluated in ANO&hyph;1 SAR Section 9.6.2.6. Additionally, the
NRC performed an independent evaluation of the radiological consequences of a cask drop accident, as documented
in the ANO&hyph;1 SER [safety evaluation report] dated June 6, 1973. The evaluation of the unlikely event of a cask
drop accident included assessment of equipment failures and has shown the consequences to be within acceptable bounds.
Since no new accident scenarios can be identified related to the proposed amendment request, this change is bounded
by the analysis described in the SAR and does not create the possibility of a new or different kind of accident from any
previously evaluated. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Criterion 3_Does Not Involve a Significant Reduction in the Margin of Safety. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Although allowing use of the Auxiliary Building crane where [sic] previously prohibited by the TS could increase
the possibility of a cask drop accident, the margin of safety is preserved in that the acceptable consequences of the
cask drop accident evaluation in SAR Section 9.6.2.6 are not affected by this change. The proposed amendment request
will not adversely affect the adequacy and conservatism of the cask drip accident evaluation. Therefore, the cask
handling issue at ANO&hyph;1 continues to exhibit an acceptable margin of safety and does not involve a significant
reduction in the margin of safety.

The proposed amendments for St. Lucie Units 1 and 2 simply relocate tables of response time limits for instrumentation
of the Reactor Protective System (RPS) and Engineered Safety Features Actuation System (ESFAS) from the Technical
Specifications (TS) to the Updated Safety Analysis Report (UFSAR). The proposed amendments conform to the guidance
given in Enclosures 1 and 2 of USNRC Generic Letter 93&hyph;08 (GL 93&hyph;08). Neither the response time limits nor
the surveillance requirements for performing response time testing will be altered by this submittal. The overall
RPS and ESFAS system functional capabilities will not be changed and assurance that actions of the protective and
engineered safety features systems are completed within the time limits assumed in the accident analyses is unaffected
by the proposed TS changes. Therefore, operation of the facility in accordance with the proposed amendment will not
involve a significant increase in the probability or consequences of an accident previously evaluated.

 The proposed amendments would revise Technical Specification (TS) 3.2.4, ``Quadrant Power Tilt Ratio,'' to add

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
an exception to the requirements of TS 3.0.4. Specifically, to add ACTION statement ``d. The provisions of Specification
3.0.4 are not applicable.''

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Basis for proposed no significant hazards consideration determination
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
: In 1992, the Vogtle TSs were amended in accordance with the recommendations of Generic Letter 87&hyph;09 to revise
the wording of TS 3.0.4 and to delete from TS 3.2.4 the statement that the provisions of TS 3.0.4 are not applicable.
With the revised wording of TS 3.0.4, the statement of the non-applicability of the provisions of TS 3.0.4 was redundant
for many individual specifications, and its deletion caused no change in ACTION requirements. However, in the case
of TS 3.2.4, the deletion had the unintended effect of prohibiting power escalation above 50% rated thermal power
(RTP) whenever the quadrant power tilt ratio (QPTR) exceeds 1.0.2. This unnecessarily delays power escalation.
The proposed amendment would correct this error and restore the originally intended meaning of TS 3.2.4. The intent
of TS 3.2.4 is to permit the escalation of reactor power above 50% RTP for limited times and

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

under specified conditions when the QPTR is greater than 1.02. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
With the original requirements of TS 3.2.4 restored, plant operation and power escalation during startup would be
the same as previously approved. Therefore, the proposed change (1) does not involve a significant increase in the
probability or consequences or an accident previously evaluated, (2) does not create the possibility of a new or different
kind of accident than previously evaluated, and (3) does not involve a significant reduction in the margin of safety.

Description of amendment request:
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 The purposes of the request are to change the plant Technical Specifications (TS) to modify Operational Safety Instrumentation
requirements to specify completion times which allows for performance of maintenance or surveillance within a reasonable
time and to be consistent with the allowable outage time for other safety-related equipment when only one train is
affected.

1. Operation of the facility in accordance with the proposed amendment would not involve a significant increase in
the probability of occurrence or the consequence of an accident previously evaluated. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The proposed amendment permits time to restore instrumentation channels to operable status which is consistent
with existing times allowed for outage of other safety-related equipment affecting one train. With regard to the
1 hour timeclock, this time is sufficient to perform the required action necessary to restore minimum required conditions.
Allowing 6 hours to reduce reactor power in an orderly manner without challenging plant systems is reasonable, based
on operating experience. Thus, the proposed amendment maintains an adequate degree of equipment availability without
requiring unnecessary initiation of a plant shutdown for partial equipment outages. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Therefore, it can be concluded that the proposed changes do not involve a significant increase in the probability
or consequences of an accident previously evaluated. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
2. Operation of the facility in accordance with the proposed amendment would not create the possibility of a new or
different kind of accident from any accident previously evaluated. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The proposed amendment affects the [Reactor Protection System] RPS and the [Engineered Safeguards Actuation System]
ESAS by providing timeclocks to perform corrective actions. During this timeclock period the safety function of
the RPS can still be completed by the remaining minimum required channels. If an accident occurred while one ESAS train
was inoperable due to faulty pressure switches or a faulty manual actuation channel, the redundant train would complete
the safety function. The proposed time allowed for the pressure switches in one train or the faulty manual actuation
channel to be out of service is bounded by the allowable time for other safety-related equipment such that only one
train is affected. The proposed 8 hour timeclock associated with the [Reactor Building] RB purge radiation monitor,
RMA&hyph;9, provides adequate time to confirm a problem exists and perform minor troubleshooting. The containment
isolation function for the RB purge valves would still be maintained by a redundant 4 psig ESAS signal and a redundant
reactor trip containment isolation signal. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Therefore, the proposed amendment does not create the possibility of a new or different accident. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
3. Operation of the facility in accordance with the proposed amendment would not involve a significant reduction
in a margin of safety. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
As noted in the Bases for Specification 3.5.1, every reasonable effort will be made to maintain all safety instrumentation
in operation. If RPS or ESAS instrumentation is found to be inoperable or require maintenance to assure reliability,
the proposed amendment will allow the performance of maintenance and surveillance in a reasonable time period. The
change does not result in a significant reduction in a margin of safety for the RPS because the automatic functions
and various alternative manual trip methods are still available. Also, this change does not result in a significant
reduction in a margin of safety for the ESAS because at least one train of safety features is required for continued
operation within the specified timeclocks with automatic and manual trip functions. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Thus, operation of the facility in accordance with the proposed amendment does not involve a significant reduction
in a margin of safety.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->
1. Operation of the facility in accordance with the proposed amendment would not involve a significant increase in
the probability of occurrence or the consequences of an accident previously evaluated. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The proposed amendment specifies an allowable outage time for testing of the EFW pumps. Also, this proposed change
reflects the current NRC staff position regarding the need for additional testing to assure OPERABILITY. The allowable
outage time this change provides for EFW pump testing is acceptable because the operator action required to make the
motor driven EFW pump OPERABLE is minimal and can be performed in a very short time by the Control Room Operator who is
continuously present during the time by the motor-driven EFW pump is in the Pull-To-Lock position. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The changes affecting OPERABILITY determinations of redundant train/components for reactor building isolation
valves and the control room air treatment systems reflect the current NRC staff position. Verifying that the required
periodic surveillance testing is current and there are no known reasons to suggest the redundant train/component
is inoperable, provides adequate assurance of system OPERABILITY. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Therefore, it can be concluded that the proposed changes do not involve a significant increase in the probability
or consequences of an accident previously evaluated. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
2. Operation of the facility in accordance with the proposed amendment would not create the possibility of a new or
different kind of accident from any accident previously evaluated. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The proposed amendment specifies an allowable outage time and deletes unnecessary redundant equipment testing.
These changes do not change system operational requirements or response to system transients. Therefore, the proposed
amendment does not create the possibility of a new or different kind of accident. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
3. Operation of the facility in accordance with the proposed amendment would not involve a significant reduction
in a margin of safety. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The proposed amendment specifies an allowable outage time and replaces redundant equipment testing with verification
that surveillance is current as an adequate means to ensure OPERABILITY. These changes do not involve any activities
associated with the margin of safety envelope. Thus, operation of the facility in accordance with the proposed amendment
does not involve a significant reduction in a margin of safety.

Description of amendment request:
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 The licensee proposes to amend the South Texas Project technical specifications (TS) by modifying TS 3.4.9.3, ``Reactor
Coolant System_Overpressure Protection Systems,'' Figure 3.4&hyph;4, ``Nominal Maximum Allowable PORV Setpoint
for the Cold Overpressure System,'' for the cold overpressure mitigation system (COMS) with a revised setpoint curve.
The proposed amendment would account for the pressure losses of the reactor coolant flow through the reactor core
with either two or four reactor coolant pumps (RCP) operating. It was determined that the original COMS setpoint curve
neglected reactor coolant pressure losses due to flow through the reactor core with the RCPs operating. The resulting
pressure at the reactor vessel downcomer at the elevation equivalent to the core mid-plane was higher than the pressure
at the sensing point located in the residual heat removal system suction line connected to the reactor coolant system
(RCS) hot leg. The proposed amendment would lower the power 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
operated relief valve (PORV) setpoint limit by a quantity equal to the pressure difference between the pressure at
the reactor vessel downcomer at the elevation of the core mid-plane and the pressure at the location of the residual
heat removal system pressure transmitters.

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
As required by 10 CFR 50.91(a), the licensee has provided its analysis of the issue of no significant hazards consideration,
which is presented below:
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG QTAG 04 -->
<!-- PJG /QTAG -->
 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->
(1) The proposed change does not involve a significant increase in the probability or consequences of a previously
evaluated accident. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The presently existing pressurizer Power Operated Relief Valves (PORVs) setpoints, provided by the Cold Overpressure
Mitigation System Curve (Figure 3.4&hyph;4) of Technical Specification 3.4.9.3, are nonconservative in that they
do not account for reactor coolant pressure losses due to flow through the reactor core with Reactor Coolant Pump (RCPs)
in operation. When RCP operation is considered, the pressure at the reactor vessel downcomer, at an elevation equivalent
to core midplane, is higher than the pressure sensing point located in the Residual Heat Removal System suction line
connection to the Reactor Coolant System (RCS) hot leg. Houston Lighting &amp; Power Company became aware of this
condition and re-analyzed the Cold Overpressurization Event for the South Texas Project. The re-analysis has resulted
in modifications to Figure 3.4&hyph;4 of Technical Specification 3.4.9.3. The re-analysis reduced the PORVs setpoint
to account for the pressure losses and provides for a setpoint for two Reactor Coolant Pump operation and for four Reactor
Coolant Pump operation. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The proposed decrease in the PORVs setpoint reduces the pressure versus temperature limit for the RCS under start-up
and shut-down operations. The decreased PORV setpoints for post-overpressure incidents will ensure that RCS pressure
will be maintained within acceptable limits during low temperature water solid operation for both two and four pump
operation. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The proposed change is based on a re-analysis which accounts for reactor coolant pressure losses through the reactor
core. Reflecting actual reactor coolant pressure losses and adjusting the PORV setpoint as necessary has no adverse
effect on the probability or consequences of an accident previously evaluated. Therefore, the proposed changes
not only do not involve a significant increase in the probability or consequences of an accident previously evaluated,
but actually maintain the original design basis. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(2) The proposed change does not create the possibility of a new or different kind of accident from any previously evaluated.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The proposed decrease in the PORV setpoints ensures that staggered operation of the two PORVs are maintained, thus
minimizing the potential for large pressure undershoots resulting from multiple valve operation which may compromise
the Reactor Coolant Pump No. 1 Seal integrity. It also restricts the total number of discharge ports at any given moment
to that absolutely necessary for pressure control. In addition, operation of either PORV provides the required design
basis relief capacity and the required redundancy necessary to meet single failure criteria. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The proposed change is the result of a re-analysis of a previously evaluated accident. Therefore, the proposed changes
do not create the possibility of a new or different kind of accident from any accident previously evaluated. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(3) The proposed change does not involve a significant reduction in the margin of safety. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The proposed change corrects an error present in the original analysis by accounting for reactor coolant pressure
losses through the reactor core. The revised COMS curves are the result of a re-analysis of the original COMS analysis.
The new analysis preserves the originally intended margin of safety. Therefore, the proposed changes do not involve
a significant reduction in a margin of safety.

Description of amendment request:

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 The licensee proposes to revise Technical Specifications 3.1.2.3 ``Reactivity Control Systems Charging 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Pumps_Shutdown'' and 3.1.2.1 ``Boration Systems Flow Paths_Shutdown.'' The amendment would allow energizing
of an inoperable centrifugal charging pump in preparation for switching of the centrifugal charging pumps, provided
the pump discharge is isolated from the reactor coolant system. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Basis for proposed no significant hazards consideration determination:
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 As required by 10 CFR 50.91(a), the licensee has provided its analysis of the issue of no significant hazards consideration.
The NRC staff has reviewed the licensee's analysis against the standards of 10 CFR 50.92(c). The NRC staff's review
is presented below: 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(1) The proposed change does not involve a significant increase in the probability or consequences of a previously
evaluated accident. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The proposed change is to modify the note which permits energizing of an inoperable centrifugal charging pump for
testing purposes, provided the pump discharge is isolated from the reactor coolant system, to include pump energization
for switching purposes. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The proposed changes can potentially impact two events during Modes 4, 5, and 6: (1) Cold overpressurization of the
reactor coolant system, and (2) boron dilution resulting in a return to criticality. The requirements of Specification
3.1.2.3 with regard to the cold overpressure mitigation system analysis would remain valid because the inoperable
centrifugal charging pump would be isolated from the reactor coolant system. A return to criticality would be prevented
because the action statement of Specification 3.1.2.1 would be entered if the boron injection flow path could not
be restored following centrifugal charging pump switching. Therefore, allowing energization of an inoperable
pump for switching would have an insignificant effect on the probability of an overpressurization and boron dilution
accident. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Energization of an inoperable pump is currently permitted for testing purposes provided the pump discharge is isolated
from the reactor coolant system. It is operationally desirable to maintain flow to the reactor coolant pump seals
during the centrifugal charging pump switching process. This proposed change will not only protect the reactor coolant
system from overpressurization at low temperatures, but will also provide the capability of maintaining reactor
coolant pump seal injection flow during the switching process. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Therefore, there is no increase in the probability or consequences of a previously evaluated accident. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(2) The proposed change does not create the possibility of a new or different kind of accident from any previously evaluated.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Required boron injection flow paths would be maintained in Modes 4, 5, and 6 except during centrifugal charging pump
switching. In the event the boron injection flow path could not be restored after centrifugal charging pump switching,
the action statement of Specification 3.1.2.1 would be entered. The proposed changes would not affect the operability
of safety-related equipment and reactor coolant pump seal injection flow could be maintained. The plant operators
are knowledgeable of the potential situation being created by energizing two centrifugal charging pumps and will
follow direct administrative controls to isolate the pumps from the reactor coolant system. Therefore, the possibility
of a new or different kind of accident is not created. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(3) The proposed change does not involve a significant reduction in the margin of safety. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Cold overpressure mitigating system requirements in Specification 3.1.2.3 would continue to be maintained as a
result of the proposed change. Thus, 10 CFR 50 Appendix G limits will not be affected. Although the boron injection
flow path required by Specification 3.1.2.1 may briefly be compromised, there is no significant reduction in a margin
of safety because core alterations would be halted and positive reactivity changes would not be made if the boron injection
path could not be maintained after centrifugal charging pump switching. This action, coupled with the short 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
time period required for centrifugal charging pump switching, would preclude a return to criticality event. Therefore,
there is no significant reduction in a margin of safety. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Based on this review, it appears that the standards of 10 CFR 50.92(c) are satisfied. Therefore, the NRC staff proposes
to determine that the request for amendments involves no significant hazards consideration.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Description of amendment request:
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 The proposed amendments would revise the combined Technical Specifications (TS) for the Diablo Canyon Power Plant
Unit Nos. 1 and 2 to revise TS 3/4.7.2.1, ``Steam Generator Pressure/Temperature Limitation,'' 3/4.7.7.1, ``Snubbers,''
3/4.7.8.1, ``Sealed Source Contamination,'' 3/4.7.11, ``Area Temperature Monitoring,'' and 3/4.7.13, ``Flood
Protection,'' in accordance with the Commission's Final Policy Statement on TS Improvements for Nuclear Power Reactors.
These TS would be relocated to plant administrative controls and the final safety analysis report by reference.

Basis for proposed no significant hazards consideration determination:
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 As required by 10 CFR 50.91(a), the licensee has provided its analysis of the issue of no significant hazards consideration,
which is presented below:
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG QTAG 04 -->
<!-- PJG /QTAG -->
 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->
a. Do the changes involve a significant increase in the probability or consequences of an accident previously evaluated?

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
These proposed changes simplify the TS, meet regulatory requirements for relocated TS, and implement the recommendations
of the Commission's Final Policy Statement on TS Improvements. Future changes to these requirements will be controlled
by 10 CFR 50.59. The proposed changes are administrative in nature and do not involve any modifications to any plant
equipment or affect plant operation. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Therefore, the proposed changes do not involve a significant increase in the probability or consequences of an accident
previously evaluated. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
b. Do the changes create the possibility of a new or different kind of accident from any accident previously evaluated?

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The proposed changes are administrative in nature, do not involve any physical alterations to any plant equipment,
and cause no change in the method by which any safety-related system performs its function. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Therefore, the proposed changes do not create the possibility of a new or different kind of accident from any accident
previously evaluated. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
c. Do the changes involve a significant reduction in a margin of safety? 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The proposed changes do not alter the basic regulatory requirements and do not affect any safety analyses. Therefore,
the proposed changes do not involve a significant reduction in a margin of safety.

Description of amendment request:
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 The proposed amendment, as revised, by Portland General Electric Company, PGE or the licensee, would change the Trojan
Nuclear Plant (Trojan) Appendix A Technical Specifications to reflect the permanently defueled status of the facility.
The permanent cessation of power generation at Trojan and the May 5, 1993 amendment to the license which granted the
licensee a Possession Only License for the facility has rendered many of the existing provisions of the current Appendix
A Technical Specifications inappropriate. PGE has developed Permanently Defueled Technical Specifications (PDTS)
for Trojan using NUREG&hyph;1431, ``Standard Technical Specifications, Westinghouse Plants,'' as a basis for
the PDTS scope and format.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Based on a series of discussions between the PGE staff and the NRC on February 9, 1994 and February 28, 1994 the licensee
has revised several requirements contained in the original June 27, 1993 amendment request. These revisions were
forwarded to the NRC staff by letter dated March 8, 1994. The March 8, 1994 revision updates the June 27, 1993 submittal
deleting reference to sections that had been relocated out of the Technical Specifications by amendments granted
since June 1993. It also provided supplemental information concerning the deletion and/or relocation of certain
existing Trojan Technical Specifications requested by the NRC staff. The March 8, 1994 submittal also clarified
the long term organization at the site, established a line of succession for the operational command and control function,
modified the review and audit functions performed by the Independent Review and Audit Committee assuring their independence
of review, required independent review of certain programs and manuals, limited annual and quarterly doses and operability
and usage of the effluent treatment systems to conform to Appendix I to 10 CFR Part 50, continued the existing requirement
for surveillance of former structural modifications to the facility, and required the submission of an annual radioactive
effluent release report in accordance with 10 CFR 50.36a.

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Basis for proposed no significant hazards consideration determination:
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 As required by 10 CFR 50.92(a), the licensee has provided an analysis of the issue of no significant hazards consideration.
In accordance with the requirements of 10 CFR 50.92, Issuance of Amendment, this license amendment request, as revised,
is judged to involve no significant hazards consideration based upon the following:
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG QTAG 04 -->
<!-- PJG /QTAG -->
 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->
1. Operation of the facility in accordance with the proposed amendment would not involve a significant increase in
the probability or consequences of an accident previously evaluated. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The licensee analysis shows that the worst case design basis accident for this plant, in its permanently shutdown
defueled state, is a fire in the radioactive waste annex building. The licensee has also identified a second design
basis accident scenario, a fuel handling accident in the vicinity of the Trojan spent fuel pool. Other Trojan Final
Safety Analysis Report (FSAR) accident scenarios addressed in Chapter 15 are no longer applicable to Trojan in the
permanently defueled mode. The proposed amendment, as revised, does not lessen any of the requirements associated
with either the radioactive waste annex building or the spent fuel pool therefore the probability of either accident
occurring is unchanged. The proposed amendment, as revised, does not change the consequences of the accident since
it does not affect the magnitude, detection, or mitigation of either accident scenario. Additionally, the ability
of the radioactive waste annex building and the spent fuel pool to withstand other applicable FSAR events, natural
phenomena, and fires is either unchanged from the existing licensing basis or is improved during the permanently
defueled condition. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
2. Operation of the facility in accordance with the proposed amendment would not create the possibility of a new or
different kind of accident from any accident previously evaluated. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Maintaining the permanently defueled facility in accordance with the PDTS, as revised by the March 8, 1994 letter,
does not create the possibility of a new or different kind of accident from any previously considered. Most of the existing
plant systems and functions will not be operational in the permanently defueled condition since power operations
are prohibited and all of the fuel at Trojan is stored in the spent fuel pool. However, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG /STAG -->

<!-- PJG STAG 4703 -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=53 g=1 f=1 -->
all structures, systems and components that are necessary for safe fuel handling and storage activities will be maintained
operable during the permanently defueled condition. The proposed PDTS, as revised, provide operation and surveillance
requirements and administrative controls which are sufficient to ensure that the required structures, systems
and components will be maintained operable in the permanently defueled condition. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->
3. Operation of the facility in accordance with the proposed amendment does not involve a significant reduction in
a margin of safety. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The proposed PDTS, as revised by the March 8, 1994 letter, are sufficient to ensure no reduction in a margin of safety,
in part, because of the reduced range of design basis accidents against which the facility must be protected now that
the facility is prohibited from power operations and is permanently defueled. Only a fire in the radioactive waste
storage facility or a fuel handling accident are relevant during the permanently defueled condition. The margins
of safety for both of these accidents will remain the same or improve by maintaining the facility in accordance with
the proposed PDTS, as revised. None of the other Chapter 15 FSAR accidents are applicable since power operations are
prohibited and the facility is permanently defueled. Additionally, the margins of safety for other applicable FSAR
events, natural phenomena, and fires are either unchanged from the existing licensing basis or is improved during
the permanently defueled condition.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The proposed changes would revise surveillance test intervals and allowed outage times for reactor trip system (RTS)
and engineered safety feature actuation system (ESFAS) instrumentation. The proposed changes would also revise
certain RTS/ESFAS functions, minimum channels operable, channel calibration, and channel functional test requirements
to ensure they are in concert with the Westinghouse Standard Technical Specifications and WCAP&hyph;10271, ``Evaluation
of Surveillance Frequencies and Out-of-Service Times for Reactor Protection Instrumentation Systems.''

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Basis for proposed no significant hazards consideration determination: 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
As required by 10 CFR 50.91(a), the licensee has provided its analysis of the issue of no significant hazards consideration,
which is presented below:
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG QTAG 04 -->
<!-- PJG /QTAG -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->
(1) The proposed changes to the RTS/ESFAS STIs [surveillance test intervals] and AOTs [allowed outage times], and
Minimum Channels Operable, Channel Calibration and Channel Functional Test requirements will not involve a significant
increase in the probability or consequences of an accident previously evaluated.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The determination that the result of the proposed changes associated with STI and AOT are within all acceptable criteria
[that] has been established in the SERs [Safety Evaluations] prepared for WCAP&hyph;10271; WCAP&hyph;10271 Supplement
1; WCAP&hyph;10271 Supplement 2; and WCAP&hyph;10271 Supplement 2, Revision 1. Implementation of the proposed
changes results in a slight increase in the Reactor Trip System yearly unavailability. This slight increase, which
is primarily due to less frequent surveillance, results in a slight increase in Core Damage Frequency (CDF) and public
health risk. The values determined by the WOG and presented in the WCAP for the increase in CDR were verified by Brookhaven
National Laboratory (BNL) as part of an audit and sensitivity analyses for the NRC staff. Based on the small value of
the increase compared to the range of uncertainty in the CDF, the increase is considered acceptable. Increasing STIs
and AOTs is not expected to affect the probability or consequences of previously evaluated accidents.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The change associated with the Minimum Channel Operable requirement for the RTS Turbine Trip by Turbine Throttle
Valve Closure provides additional operating flexibility based on the Westinghouse Standard Technical Specifications,
Revision 5. The new action statement ensures that any inoperable channel is placed in trip, and the remaining operable
channels fulfill the necessary reactor trip diversity function. The change associated with the ESFAS Minimum Channel
Operable requirement for Containment Pressure_High-High assures that the Technical Specifications reflect the
correct as-built design actuation logic while ensuring the function continues to meet the single failure criteria.
The proposed change to the turbine trip reactor trip function Channel Calibration reflects the assumptions in WCAP&hyph;10271
and current Farley calibration practices. The proposed change to the safety injection ESF [engineered safety feature]
input for the reactor trip Channel Functional Test is consistent with the assumptions in WCAP&hyph;10271 and current
Farley surveillance testing practices. The proposed changes to the ESF permissive interlocks Channel Calibration
and Channel Functional Test requirements are in concert with the NRC SER for WCAP&hyph;10271 and Farley surveillance
practices. The proposed change to the ESF manual initiation functions Channel Functional Test reflects the proper
surveillance requirements for a Westinghouse Solid State Protection System (SSPS). The proposed changes to these
RTS/ESFAS Channel Calibration and Channel Functional Test requirements are also consistent with Westinghouse
Standard Technical Specifications.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(2) The proposed changes will not create the possibility of a new or different kind of accident from any accident previously
evaluated. The proposed changes to not involve hardware changes and do not result in a change in the manner in which
the RTS/ESFAS provides plant protection or the manner in which surveillance testing is perform to demonstrate operability.
Therefore, a new or different kind of accident will not occur as a result of these changes.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(3) The proposed changes do not involve a significant reduction in a margin of safety. The proposed changes do not alter
the manner in which safety limits, limiting safety system setpoints, or limiting conditions for operation are determined.
The impact of reduced testing, other than as addressed above, is to allow a longer time interval over which instrument
uncertainties (e.g., drift) may act. Evaluations have been performed to assure that the plant setpoints properly
account for these instrument uncertainties over the longer time interval. RTS diversity is still provided by the
Turbine Throttle Valve closure logic circuits. Steam Line Isolation diversity continues to be provided by the ESFAS
Containment Pressure_High-High. Changes to certain RTS/ESFAS Channel Calibration and Channel Functional Test
surveillances clarify what tests are required and when the tests are performed. Implementation of the proposed changes
is expected to result in an overall improvement in safety as noted below.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
a. Less frequent testing will potentially result in fewer inadvertent reactor trips and ESF component actuation.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
b. Longer allowed outage times provide for better assessments of problems and easier repairs, ultimately resulting
in better equipment performance. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
c. Less frequent distraction of the plant operator and shift supervisor to attend to and support instrumentation
testing will improve the effectiveness of the operating staff in monitoring and controlling plant operation.

Basis for proposed no significant hazards consideration determination: 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
As required by 10 CFR 50.91(a), the licensee has provided its analysis of the issue of no significant hazards consideration.
The NRC staff has reviewed the licensee's analysis against the standards of 10 CFR 50.92(c). The staff's review is
presented below.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The proposed changes do not involve a significant increase in the probability or consequences of an accident previously
evaluated because the proposed changes do not involve a change to the plant design or operation. The changes simply
involve the frequency at which testing of the instrumentation is performed and the AOT for instruments. There may
be a small increase in average instrument failure frequency as a result of increasing the surveillance interval.
However, the proposed changes will require that a check be made for the majority of instruments to assure that making
them inoperable for surveillance testing or repair does not result in a loss of function. This added check assures
that a loss of function has not occurred, or if it has, that the appropriate ACTION statement be entered promptly. Therefore,
these proposed changes do not result in a significant increase in either the probability or consequences of any accident
previously analyzed.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The proposed changes do not create the possibility of a new or different kind of accident from any accident previously
evaluated because the proposed changes do not result in any change in the plant design or operation. The changes are
for increased AOT and decreased frequency of instrumentation testing. The instrumentation involved are those instruments
which sense plant problems and/or accidents, and then initiate systems or alarms to respond to the plant problem/accident.
The proposed changes do not modify any of the instruments, or the initiation logic formed by the instruments. Therefore,
no new or different type of an accident has been created.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The proposed changes do not involve a significant reduction in a margin of safety because the small increase in average
instrument failure frequency is offset by safety benefits such as a reduction in the number of inadvertent test-induced
scrams, a reduction in wear due to excessive equipment test cycling, and better optimization of plant personnel resources.
In addition, the proposed changes will require that a check be made for the majority of instruments to assure that making
them inoperable for surveillance testing or repair does not result in a loss of function. This added check assures
that a loss of function has not occurred, or if it has, that the appropriate ACTION statement be entered promptly. Therefore,
these proposed changes do not result in a significant reduction in a margin of safety.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->

Basis for proposed no significant hazards consideration determination: 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
As required by 10 CFR 50.91(a), the licensee has provided its analysis of the issue of no significant hazards consideration,
which is presented below:
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG QTAG 04 -->
<!-- PJG /QTAG -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->
1. The proposed changes do not involve a significant increase in the probability or consequences of a previously evaluated
accident.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The proposed change increases the power at which the verification of the Reactor Coolant System flow rate with a precision
heat balance can be performed. The only potentially relevant concern for this change is the possibility of having
insufficient flow to support the accident analyses at the higher (85%) power level. Power level and RCS flow are important
parameters in determining the severity of an event but have no impact on the initiation of an event or accident. Thus,
the change does not involve a significant increase in the probability of any previously analyzed accident.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Although accidents tend to be more severe at higher initial power levels, the acceptance criteria of the applicable
safety analyses continue to be met [even when the test is conducted at the higher power level]. Thus, the proposed change
would not involve an increase in the consequences of any previously analyzed accident.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
2. The proposed changes do not create the possibility of a new or different kind of accident from any accident previously
evaluated.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The proposed change merely increases the power at which the initial post-refueling startup verification of RCS flow
with a precision heat balance may be performed. Since the new power level is within the normal operating range of the
reactor, it does not create the possibility of a new or different kind of accident from any accident previously evaluated.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
3. The proposed changes do not involve a significant reduction in the margin of safety.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The proposed change increases the power which can be attained prior to verification of the Reactor Coolant System
flow with a precision heat balance. The power value is increased from 75% RTP [rated thermal power] to 85% RTP. An analysis
was performed which demonstrates that the safety analysis DNB [departure from nucleate boiling] limit will not be
exceeded if the initial power is 85% or less, even with a significant reduction in flow. A flow reduction significantly
different from the expected flow is highly unlikely, however, since RCS flow is verified by measurement of elbow tap
differential pressure prior to operation in Mode 1. This flow measurement, although less accurate than the precision
heat balance, is sufficient to assure adequate flow at 85% power. Adequate limitations on power level, F delta-H verification,
and the power range neutron flux-high setpoint are imposed during post-refueling power ascension to ensure that
if the RCS flow is not verified with a precision heat balance until 85% RTP, the results of the accident analyses would
remain valid.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The evaluation of the DNB-limited events, initiated from a power level of 85% RTP, considered the limitations imposed
during the power ascension. Based on this evaluation, it is concluded that, even though 85% RTP is a more severe initial
condition, the applicable event acceptance criteria would continue to be met; therefore, the proposed change does
not involve a significant reduction in the margin of safety.

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG /STAG -->

<!-- PJG STAG 4703 -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->
Either the current testing option, which remains valid for fuel oil with ASTM Color 5 or less, or the alternative testing
method, provide the necessary assurance that the water and sediment quantity in the new fuel oil is acceptable. As
the performance of the quantitative water and sediment test of ASTM-D1796&hyph;1968, maintains essentially the
same attribute qualities of the new fuel oil, there should not be any undetected degradation in the Diesel Generator
fuel oil supply.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Therefore, since the fuel oil supply will be maintained at its present quality level, there should be no increase in
the probability or consequences of an accident previously evaluated.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
2. The proposed changes do not create the possibility of a new or different kind of accident from any accident previously
evaluated.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
As stated in (1) above, the proposed amendment only provides a quantitative method for the acceptability determination
of new Diesel Generator fuel oil. The proposed testing will continue to verify the high quality and acceptability
of the fuel oil supply. There should not be any possibility that a new or different kind of accident from those previously
evaluated is created.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
3. The proposed changes do not involve a significant reduction in the margin of safety.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The only margin associated with this amendment is the margin between the acceptance limit on water and sediment in
the fuel oil supply and the quantity of water and sediment that could impact Diesel Generator operation. The ``clear
and bright'' testing per ASTM-D4176&hyph;1982 and the proposed quantitative testing per ASTM-D1796&hyph;1968
are both written to detect and reject fuel oil containing water or sediment at essentially the same level. The margin
of safety to Diesel Generator impairment is therefore not reduced. This amendment does not involve a significant
reduction in a margin of safety.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The amendment would revise Technical Specifications 3/4.8.1.1 and 3/4.8.1.2, A. C. Sources, Operating and Shutdown.
The proposed revision changes the minimum required storage volume of the Emergency Fuel Oil storage and day tanks
from 85,300 gallons and 390 gallons to 80,400 gallons and 510 gallons. These changes are the result of inconsistencies
found by Union Electric, in the calculations and T/S Bases for tank capacities, while performing a self-initiated
Electrical Distribution System Functional Assessment (EDSFA). The Electrical Distribution System Functional
Inspection (EDSFI) performed by the NRC re-examined this issue and it was determined that NUREG&hyph;1431 provided
bases for the change to day tank level. This submittal is a T/S enhancement.

The proposed changes to Technical Specifications 3/4.8.1.1 and 3/4.8.1.2 do not involve a significant hazards consideration
because operation of Callaway Plant with these changes would not:
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(1) Involve a significant increase in the probability or consequences of an accident previously evaluated.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The current minimum required volume of the day tanks as given in T/S 3.8.1.1b.1 and 3.8.1.2b.1 is based on fuel oil with
a specific gravity value in the upper range of values allowed by T/S. Calculations made using fuel oil with a specific
gravity of 39 degrees API, which is the minimum allowed specific gravity, indicate a larger minimum required volume
is needed in the day tanks. The increased minimum required volume provides additional conservatism for the day tanks
to perform their intended safety function based on the possibility of using different specific gravity fuel oil.
The current minimum required volume of the storage tanks as given in T/S 3.8.1.1b.2 and 3.8.1.2b.2 was calculated
by using an overly conservative Net Positive Suction Head (NPSH) available calculation. The original calculation
assumed a static head was needed in order for the NPSH available to exceed the NPSH required and assure proper operation
of the fuel oil transfer pumps. Union Electric calculations have determined that the NPSH required for the transfer
pumps is maintained as long as the pump suction is submerged. Based on this calculation the minimum required volume
of the storage tanks can be reduced and the diesel generators can still achieve their required seven days of operation
at continuous rating plus an additional volume available to be used for testing.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(2) Create the possibility of a new or different kind of accident from any previously evaluated.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
There is no new type of accident or malfunction being created and the method and manner of plant operation remains unchanged.
The safety design bases in the FSAR have not been altered, the requirement for continuous operation remains unchanged.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(3) Involve a significant reduction in a margin of safety.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
There are no plant design changes involved and no changes are being made to the safety limits or safety system settings
that would adversely impact plant safety. The minimum required storage volumes of the day and storage tanks are being
changed based on calculations using conservative data.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Based on the above discussions, it has been determined that the requested Technical Specification revisions do not
involve a significant increase in the probability or consequences of an accident or other adverse condition over
previous evaluations; or create the possibility of a new or different kind of accident or condition over previous
evaluations; or involve a significant reduction in a margin of safety. Therefore, the requested license amendment
does not involve a significant hazards consideration.

Description of amendment request: 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The proposed change would revise the Technical Specifications (TS) for the North Anna Power Station, Units No. 1 and
No. 2 (NA&hyph;1&amp;2). Specifically, the proposed change would modify the surveillance frequency of the nozzles
in the Quench Spray and the Recirculation Spray Systems at NA&hyph;1&amp;2.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The proposed changes to the surveillance requirements for the nozzles in the Quench Spray System and Recirculation
Spray Systems are consistent with the intent of Generic Letter 93&hyph;05, ``Line-Item Technical Specifications
Improvement to Reduce Surveillance Requirements for Testing During Power Operation,'' dated September 27, 1993,
which is to improve safety, decrease equipment degradation, and reduce unnecessary burden on personnel resources
by reducing testing requirements that are marginal to safety.

Specifically, operation in accordance with the proposed Technical Specifications changes will not:
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
1. Involve a significant increase in the probability of occurrence or consequences of an accident previously evaluated.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The proposed reduced testing frequency of the Spray Systems nozzles does not change the way the systems are operated
or the Spray Systems operability requirements. The proposed change to the surveillance frequency of safety equipment
has no impact on the probability of an accident occurrence nor can it create a new or different type of accident. NUREG&hyph;1366,
``Improvements to Technical Specifications Surveillance Requirements,'' dated December 1992, concluded that
the corrosion of stainless steel piping is negligible during the extended surveillance interval. Since the Spray
Systems are maintained dry there is no additional mechanism that could cause blockage of the spray nozzles. Thus,
the nozzles in the Spray Systems will remain operable during the ten year surveillance interval to mitigate the consequence
of an accident previously evaluated. To date, no clogging or blockage of the nozzles in the Spray [System] during the
five year surveillance tests [has] been observed at .&blank;.&blank;. North Anna. Testing of the Spray Systems nozzles
at the proposed reduced frequency will not increase the probability of occurrence of a postulated accident or the
consequences of an accident previously evaluated.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
2. Create the possibility of a new or different kind of accident from any accident previously evaluated.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The proposed reduced frequency testing of the Spray Systems' nozzles does not change the way the Spray Systems are
operated. The reduced frequency of testing of the spray nozzles does not change plant operation or system readiness.
The reduced frequency testing of the Spray Systems' nozzles does not generate any new accident precursors. Therefore,
the possibility of a new or different kind of accident previously evaluated is not created by the proposed changes
in surveillance frequency of the Spray Systems nozzles.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

operability requirement. NUREG&hyph;1366 concluded that the corrosion of stainless steel piping is negligible
during the extended surveillance interval. Since the Spray Systems are maintained dry there is no additional mechanism
that could cause blockage of the Spray Systems' nozzles. Thus, the proposed reduced testing frequency is adequate
to ensure spray nozzle operability. The 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
surveillance requirements do not affect the margin of safety in that the operability requirements of the Spray Systems
remains unaltered. The existing safety analysis remains bounding. Therefore, no margins of safety are adversely
affected.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
All of the proposed changes are administrative in nature, and do not involve any change in the design or operation of

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
3. Does the amendment involve a significant reduction in a margin of safety?
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

1. The proposed change does not involve a significant increase in the probability or consequences of an accident previously
evaluated.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The current minimum required volume of the day tanks as given in Technical Specifications 3.8.1.1 and 3.8.1.2 is based
on fuel oil with a specific gravity value in the upper range of values allowed by the technical specifications. Calculations
made using fuel oil with a specific gravity of 39 degrees API, which is the minimum allowed specific gravity, indicate
a larger minimum required volume is needed in the day tanks. The increased minimum required volume provides additional
conservatism for the day tanks to perform their intended safety function based on the possibility of using different
specific gravity fuel oil. The proposed change will not prevent the Emergency Diesel Generator fuel oil system from
performing its design function, nor require the system to be operated in a manner different than that for which it was
designed. Therefore, the proposed change will not increase the probability or consequences of an accident previously
evaluated.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
2. The proposed change does not create the possibility of a new or different kind of accident from any previously evaluated.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
There is no new type of accident or malfunction being created and the method and manner of plant operation remains unchanged.
The safety design bases in the Updated Safety Analysis Report (USAR) have not been altered, and current operating
requirements of the Emergency Diesel Generators remain unchanged. Thus, this change does not create the possibility
of a new or different kind of accident from any previously evaluated.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
3. The proposed change does not involve a significant reduction in the margin of safety.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The basis for the existing emergency fuel oil day tank level requirements is to ensure that sufficient fuel oil is available
to meet the operational requirements specified in ANSI N195&hyph;1976. This proposed change to the minimum required
storage volume of the day tanks is based on revised calculations performed in accordance with ANSI N195&hyph;1976
using conservative data. This proposed change will not change the operation of the plant. Thus, the proposed change
will continue to ensure the Emergency Diesel Generator operating requirements. There are no changes being made to
the safety limits or safety system settings that would adversely impact plant safety. Therefore, the proposed change
will not cause a reduction in the margin of safety.

Description of amendment request: 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The proposed amendment revises Technical Specification 3.9.4, Containment Building Penetrations, to allow use
of temporary alternate closure methods for the emergency personnel escape lock and containment wall penetrations,
during alterations of the core or movement of irradiated fuel within the containment.

1. The proposed change does not involve a significant increase in the probability or consequences of an accident previously
evaluated.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The probability of occurrence of a previously evaluated accident is not increased because failure to maintain containment
closure is not an initiating condition for fuel handling an accident. The use of temporary alternate closure methods
for the emergency personnel escape lock and containment wall penetrations does not introduce any new potential accident
initiating condition during refueling operation.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The consequences of an accident previously evaluated is not increased because the use of

<!-- PJG STAG 4703 -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=53 g=1 f=1 -->
temporary alternate closure methods for the emergency personnel escape lock and containment wall penetrations
will provide the assurance of containment closure during refueling activities. The ability of [the] containment
to restrict the release of any fission product radioactivity to the environment remains unchanged.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->
2. The proposed change does not create the possibility of a new or different kind of accident from any previously evaluated.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The failure of the temporary alternate closure methods for the emergency personnel escape lock and containment wall
penetrations during refueling will not result in a malfunction of any other plant equipment. The sole purpose of establishing
containment closure for refueling is to restrict the release of any fission product radioactivity in the event of
a fuel handling accident.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
3. The proposed change does not involve a significant reduction in the margin of safety.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The temporary alternate closure methods for the emergency personnel escape lock and containment wall penetrations
will provide the same assurance of containment closure during refueling for credible accident scenarios. The ability
of containment to restrict the release of any fission product radioactivity to the environment, should a fuel handling
accident occur, remains unchanged.

Description of amendment request: 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The proposed amendment revises Technical Specification 4.7.1.2.1.a to require that the turbine-driven and motor-driven
auxiliary feedwater pumps be tested at least quarterly on a staggered test basis instead of the currently required
testing once per 31 days on a staggered test basis. In addition, the proposed changes would revise Technical Specification
Bases 3/4.7.7, Emergency Exhaust System_Auxiliary Building, and 3/4.9.13, Emergency Exhaust System_Fuel Building,
to eliminate the reference to the use of automatic control for the emergency exhaust system heaters.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Basis for proposed no significant hazards consideration determination: 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
As required by 10 CFR 50.91(a), the licensee has provided its analysis of the issue of no significant hazards consideration.
The staff has reviewed the licensee's analysis against the standards of 10 CFR 50.92(c). The NRC staff's review is
presented below.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
1. The proposed change does not involve a significant increase in the probability or consequences of an accident previously
evaluated.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
This change only revises the surveillance requirement for the auxiliary feedwater pumps. The purpose of this surveillance
requirement is to prove that the pumps are operable. The longer test interval should result in greater availability
by reducing the rate of test induced failures which should offset any loss in reliability. The revised surveillance
requirement does not affect the probability of accident initiation. The operability of the pumps is maintained and
therefore the consequences of evaluated accidents is unaffected by the proposed change. The revised surveillance
frequency is consistent with the guidance issued in Generic Letter 93&hyph;05, ``Line-Item Technical Specifications
Improvements to Reduce Surveillance Requirements for Testing During Power Operation.''
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Changes to the emergency exhaust system technical specifications eliminate the words ``using automatic control''
associated with the humidity controlling heaters. These changes reflect the current method in which the fuel building
emergency exhaust system heaters are controlled in that humidity sensors are bypassed to allow continuous operation
of the heaters whenever the emergency exhaust system fans are operating. The proposed changes do not affect the probability
of initiating an accident previously evaluated. The ability of the emergency exhaust systems to mitigate the consequences
of an accident are likewise unaffected since the heaters remain available and operating to control humidity.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
2. The proposed change does not create the possibility of a new or different kind of accident from any previously evaluated.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Verification of pump operability is still maintained with the change to the frequency of the surveillance requirement.
No system configuration 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
changes are being implemented in order to perform the surveillance testing and any potential accidents that may be
associated with the surveillance testing were previously considered. The changing of the surveillance frequency
does not introduce any additional failure modes for the auxiliary feedwater system.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The proposed revisions to the emergency exhaust system technical specifications are limited to the automatic control
of the humidity controlling heaters. The proposed change does not introduce any new potential challenges to fission
product barriers or any new failure modes which might prevent the emergency exhaust systems from fulfilling their
accident mitigating functions.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
3. The proposed change does not involve a significant reduction in the margin of safety.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The inservice testing program will continue to ensure that auxiliary feedwater pumps operational readiness criteria
are consistent with the requirements of ASME Section XI. System performance surveillances will continue to be conducted
in accordance with the technical specifications. The proposed change does not significantly reduce the margin of
safety because the availability and reliability of the auxiliary feedwater system are not significantly decreased
and the heat removal requirements for the system are unchanged.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The proposed changes to the emergency exhaust system technical specifications affect the requirements to maintain
heater control in the automatic mode. The proposed changes do not decrease the exhaust systems' actual ability to
control humidity or alter the other functional requirements for the system. Therefore, the proposed change does
not significantly reduce any margin of safety related to the performance of the emergency exhaust systems.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Based on this review, it appears that the three standards of 10 CFR 50.92(c) are satisfied. Therefore, the NRC staff
proposes to determine that the amendment request involves no significant hazards consideration.

: December 22, 1993 (58 FR 67842) The December 3, 1993, letter provided information in response to a staff's November
19, 1993, request for additional information. The February 14, 1994, letter requested NRC staff approval that the
flow-reduction portion of the requested technical specification (TS) change be separated from the approval of the
safety limit portion of the requested TS change. The resultant changes from the above described actions reduced the
scope of the initial proposed no significant hazards consideration determination, but, otherwise, did not change
the NRC staff's position that the three standards of 10 CFR 50.92(c) are satisfied.

The amendment provides one-time relief from the requirement to perform Type C tests (local leak rate tests) at intervals
of no greater than 2 years for the shutdown cooling isolation valves (10MOV&hyph;17 and 10MOV&hyph;18). This one-time
only delay, until the next refueling outage currently scheduled to begin in November 1994, was requested for the performance
of these leakage tests. The request was necessitated by the extended 1991&hyph;1993 refueling outage and the length
of the current operating cycle.

The proposed amendment would revise Appendix A, TS 3/4.3.1, ``Reactor Protection System (RPS) Instrumentation''
and TS 3/4.3.2.3, ``Anticipatory Reactor Trip System (ARTS) Instrumentation'' to increase RPS and ARTS channel
functional test surveillance test intervals and RPS allowed out of service times. These requests are made based on
the NRC approved Babcock &amp; Wilcox Topical Report, BAW&hyph;10167. Also, the addition of an action statement
to permit continued operation for 48 hours with two RPS channels inoperable and to remove channel functional test
surveillance requirements for source and intermediate range neutron flux instrumentation is requested. Finally,
a revision to Table 4.3&hyph;1 to decrease the channel calibration surveillance test interval for the ``High Flux
Number of Reactor Coolant Pumps On'' trip is proposed.
