Paragraph (g)(3) sets out four prohibitions for all work under the standard. One prohibition, relating to high-speed
abrasive disc saws, is made more specific; one, prohibiting dry sweeping and dry clean-up of ACM and PACM is added;
and, one prohibiting employee rotation is expanded to apply to all attempts to reduce exposure, not, as in the 1986
standard, to reach the PEL. OSHA finds these changes will help reduce employee exposures and are consistent with the
revisions to the standards.

The next set of requirements in the ``Methods of Compliance'' beginning at paragraph-(g)(4), are keyed to the four
classes of construction activities, Class I through IV, relating to previously installed ACM and PACM, defined in
paragraph (b). The scheme is risk-based with Class I as the most hazardous, and Class IV the least so. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Class I asbestos work consists of the ``removal'' of asbestos-containing TSI and surfacing material and of PACM,
including demolition operations involving these materials. Class II work consists of the ``removal'' of all other
asbestos-containing materials, including resilient flooring presumed to contain asbestos. Class III work consists
of the ``disturbance'' of all previously installed asbestos-containing building materials and PACM. Class IV work
consists of housekeeping and custodial work in contact with previously installed ACM and PACM, and the clean-up of
debris on construction sites. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
All asbestos work under the construction and shipbuilding standards is not in the ``class system.'' The installation
of new asbestos-containing products does not carry a class designation, and thus the class-specific requirements
do not apply to that activity. Work covered by the general industry standard is not included in the ``class system''
as well. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
OSHA also notes that the differences in controls required among classes is not great. Further, the Agency believes
that the risk overlap between adjoining classes is neither frequent nor large, and that the standard allows the employer
flexibility in most such cases. The regulation requires job-by-job evaluation of regulated projects, and gives
the competent person some leeway in easing some requirements when it appears that the project can be done especially
safely.

The following examples illustrate how operations involving potential asbestos disturbance are to be classified.
If an insulated pipe is leaking, and less than one standard glove bag's worth of TSI is ``disturbed'' (see definition
in paragraph B) in order to repair the leak, it is a Category III job. If the TSI is stripped from a section of piping to
inspect all the piping in an area for leaks, it is a Class I job. If the section of piping required to be stripped is less
than 25 feet, it is still a Class I job, but critical barriers may not be required if the initial exposure assessment
is ``negative'' [see (g)(4)(i)(B)]. If it is not clear which category the work belongs, the employer should assume
the higher, more restrictive, category applies, and should comply with the listed work practices and controls for
that category. OSHA believes that most asbestos work will fit easily into the categories which are defined.

OSHA found that the term ``small-scale, short-duration,'' insufficient to distinguish lower risk asbestos operations
which allow exemptions from generally required controls. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
A historical perspective is useful to clarify this issue. In 1986, OSHA required that all removal, renovation, and
demolition operations, except for ``small-scale, short duration'' operations, be conducted within negative pressure
enclosures [29 CFR 1926.58(e)(6)(1986)]. The scope of both the requirement and the exemption was unclear. The requirement
did not explicitly apply to ``maintenance or repair'' operations, though most of the examples given were in that category.
The examples cited in the exemption included pipe repair, valve replacement, installing electrical conduits, installing
or removing drywall, roofing, and other general building maintenance operations. In addition, OSHA maintained
that it was not possible to specify with precision the exact size of a ``small-scale'' maintenance job or to pinpoint
the time involved in a ``short-duration'' task. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Court of Appeals stated that OSHA had not drawn the parameters of the exemption with enough specificity and that
``the exception as now worded seems to erase the rule.'' As noted above the Court remanded the issue to OSHA to ``clarify
the exemption for ``small scale, short duration operations'' from the negative-pressure enclosure requirements.
Further the Court suggested that OSHA limit the exemption to ``work operations where it is impractical to construct
an enclosure because of the configuration of the work environment,'' stated by OSHA in the preamble to the 1986 rule,
as the intended scope of the exemption (51 FR at 22,711,2).
