The damage to manufactured homes by Hurricane Andrew was so extensive 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
that many were rendered unrecognizable. Ninety-seven percent of all 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
manufactured homes in Dade County were totally destroyed, while only eleven 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
percent of single-family homes were destroyed. The American Red Cross 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
reported that of the 1,176 licensed and registered manufactured homes in 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Homestead, Florida, 1,167 were completely destroyed. The American Red Cross 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
and FEMA have also reported a total of 11,213 manufactured homes destroyed in 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Florida and Louisiana in Hurricane Andrew, and an additional 3,016 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
manufactured homes experienced major damage. Almost 36% of all housing units 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
destroyed during Hurricane Andrew were manufactured homes. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The loss of these units had implications extending beyond the loss of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the homes and possessions of their owners. These homes, shredded by the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
winds, also became dangerous flying missiles, inflicting more property damage 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
on neighboring structures. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In its October 1992 report on Hurricane Andrew, the Federal Emergency 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Management Agency (FEMA) stated that, ``in all areas, mobile homes 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(manufactured housing) were most susceptible to damage or destruction. Many 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
mobile homes imploded from the wind loads of Hurricane Andrew. In coastal 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
areas, where mobile homes were properly `cradled' and elevated, the cradled 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
foundations remained intact, but the mobile homes mounted to these foundations 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
were often heavily damaged or destroyed.'' 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Concerns for potential losses during high winds in coastal and other 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
areas were identified previously in a May 1991 report by the Federal Emergency 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Management Agency (FEMA), which predicted that the United States can expect 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
more hurricanes of greater intensity during the 1990s and early 2000s than it 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
has experienced in recent years. Furthermore, estimates suggest that by the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
year 2010 the population density on Florida's coasts will have increased about 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
130 percent from the 1988 level. Moreover, as the national population ages, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
an increasing percentage of coastal inhabitants will probably be older 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
individuals, a group more likely to occupy manufactured houses. The American 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Association of Retired Persons (AARP) reports that 40 percent of the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
purchasers of new manufactured homes are at least 50 years old. The elderly 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
can be more difficult to evacuate and may be more prone to be injured during 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
periods of extreme high winds. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The technology for achieving economical wind resistant designs in 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
housing is available. It involves calculations of risk for extreme wind-prone 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
coastal areas and the establishment of construction standards based upon these 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
risk calculations. Through use and implementation of this approach, risks of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
injury and death can be minimized and economic loss limited to acceptable 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
levels in coastal areas subject to high winds. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In determining a course of action to address these issues, the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Department had to balance two competing concerns: (1) The need to raise 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
manufactured housing standards, to protect individuals, their homes, and their 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
neighbors from future high winds; and (2) the need to preserve the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
affordability of a key source of low-cost housing. This rule is the result of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the Department's decision to improve protection of homeowners in hurricane- 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
prone areas as soon as possible, but to delay making changes to the standards 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
in lower wind-risk areas, in order to give adequate consideration to cost 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
factors. Although the changes are expected to increase costs to consumers in 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the high-wind areas, the Department has concluded that the increases are 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
justified, because the improved standards will significantly reduce future 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
losses to occupants and the public by strengthening the features that make 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
manufactured homes vulnerable to damage and destruction in high winds. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Perhaps more importantly, the improved standards may help avoid the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
inestimable costs of devastation to people's lives and emotional health and to 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the communities, in the likelihood that another powerful hurricane hits a 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
community of manufactured homes in the hurricane-prone regions of the country.

Among the major deficiencies contributing to manufactured housing damage 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
in Hurricane Andrew were inadequate connections between exterior roof or wall 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
coverings and supporting sheathing or framing and between walls, roofs and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
floors. In particular, losses of roof coverings were widespread, and were 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
considered by some to be the first mode of failure for manufactured homes 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
damaged in Hurricane Andrew. Other roof-related damage was due to loss of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
sheathing, failure of connections, or a combination of these problems. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Numerous failures of uplift straps also occurred, when the staples pulled out 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
through the metal straps, permitting the straps to tear away from the members 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
to which they had been fastened. In some cases, entire sections of roofs were 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
blown away. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Another common area of failure was loss of exterior wall siding. Metal 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
or plastic siding used in manufactured housing was readily damaged or 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
penetrated by flying debris during the high winds in Hurricane Andrew. Loss 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
of roof or wall cladding allows the building to be penetrated by the weather 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
and has far-reaching consequences beyond the area of envelope integrity. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
As a result of these losses, and damage to windows and doors, there was 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
significant water damage and deterioration to many manufactured homes. In 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
addition, failure of coverings or attachments to the manufactured home 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
structure also caused missile-type damage to other homes.
