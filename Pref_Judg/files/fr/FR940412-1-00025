SUMMARY:
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
 EPA has decided to withdraw the proposed rulemaking to exempt Omega Phase Transformations, Inc. (Omega) from processing
prohibitions in the Asbestos Ban and Phaseout (ABPO) Rule and not to initiate rulemaking in response to a similar petition
from Vitrifix, Inc. (Vitrifix). Omega and Vitrifix had petitioned EPA for exemptions from the ABPO Rule for thermal
processes that convert asbestos-containing waste material into non-asbestos glass, and EPA had agreed to initiate
rulemaking to exempt such processes from the ABPO Rule. EPA issued a Notice of Proposed Rulemaking in the 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=4 -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
 of June 2, 1992, to grant an exemption to Omega for its vitrification process. EPA has since decided that thermal conversion
processes that destroy asbestos are not prohibited by the ABPO Rule. Accordingly, the exemption rulemaking is unnecessary.

I. Background and Discussion
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
In the 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 -->
Federal Register
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 of July 12, 1989 (54 FR 29460), EPA issued the ABPO Rule at 40 CFR 763.160&hyph;763.179 under section 6 of the Toxic Substances
Control Act (TSCA), 15 U.S.C. 2605, to prohibit, at staged intervals, the manufacture, importation, processing
and distribution in commerce of several categories of asbestos-containing products identified in the ABPO Rule.
One banned category is ``new uses of asbestos,'' which is defined in the ABPO Rule as ``commercial uses of asbestos
not identified in &sect;763.165 the manufacture, importation or processing of which would be initiated for the first
time after August 25, 1989'' (40 CFR 763.163). ``New uses of asbestos'' are banned by the ABPO Rule after August 27,
1990 (40 CFR 763.165(a), 763.167(a), and 763.169(a)). 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
On October 18, 1991, the United States Court of Appeals for the Fifth Circuit, in 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Corrosion Proof Fittings v. EPA
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
, 947 F2d 1201 (5th Cir., 1991), vacated and remanded most of the ABPO Rule. The ban on ``new uses of asbestos'' is unaffected
by the Court's remand and remains in effect. For a more complete discussion of the decision in 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Corrosion Proof Fittings v. EPA
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
, see 58 FR 58964, November 5, 1993. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The ABPO Rule specifies that applications for exemptions for new uses of asbestos will be treated as petitions to amend
the ABPO Rule pursuant to section 21 of TSCA (15 U.S.C. 2620) (See 54 FR 29464, July 12, 1989 and 40 CFR 763.173.) Section
21 of TSCA provides, in part, that any person may petition EPA to initiate a proceeding for the issuance, amendment,
or repeal of a rule issued under TSCA section 4, 6, or 8. The petition must set forth the facts which it claims establish
the need for the action. EPA is required to grant or deny the petition within 90 days after filing. If EPA grants the petition,
EPA must promptly commence an appropriate rulemaking (15 U.S.C. 2620(a)). 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The ABPO Rule also establishes general requirements for submission of data that are needed for EPA decisions on all
exemption applications, including those submitted as section 21 petitions (40 CFR 763.173). Petitioners must submit
evidence which demonstrates, among other requirements, that the proposed manufacture, importation, processing,
distribution in commerce, and use, as proposed, will not present an unreasonable risk of injury to human health (40
CFR 763.173(d)(1)(ix)).
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In response to requests for clarification of the ABPO Rule from the State of California (September 29, 1989) and Omega
(October 13, 1989) with respect to ``processes that transform asbestos into asbestos-free material'' EPA responded
that ``processing for commercial purposes asbestos-containing material (ACM) by vitrification, or other transformation
processes, was a `new use' within the meaning of the [ABPO Rule].'' Therefore, it was subject to the Rule and to the exemption
application procedures outlined in the Rule. EPA also noted that the ABPO Rule ``does not regulate disposal activities''
and:

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG QTAG 04 -->
<!-- PJG /QTAG -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->
operations that transform asbestos-containing materials, as defined in 40 CFR 61.141, into nonasbestos material
solely for disposal, (as an alternative disposal method under the asbestos NESHAP regulations), would be subject
to the disposal requirements at 40 CFR 61.151 or 61.152, or any final standards revising the asbestos NESHAP under
40 CFR 61.155.

(Letter to State of California, Department of Health Services, dated March 29, 1990. See also, letter to Omega, dated
March 30, 1990). The National Emission Standard for Hazardous Air Pollutants Standard for Operations that Convert
Asbestos-containing Waste Material into Non-asbestos (Asbestos-free) Material (the Asbestos NESHAP Standard)
went into effect in November 1990 (40 CFR 61.155).
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
On October 9, 1990, Omega submitted a TSCA section 21 petition to EPA requesting an exemption from the ABPO Rule's ``new
use'' prohibitions in order to operate its vitrification process at a location in California. Omega's proposed process
converts ACM (e.g., demolition debris from asbestos abatement projects) into glass. Omega proposed to sell the glass
as aggregate for paving material, among other uses. In addition, the metal ingots produced from the molten metal waste
by-product would be sold as scrap metal. The Omega vitrification process is a modification of glassmaking technology
which would utilize high temperatures over 2000 
<!-- PJG 0040 degreeslatlong -->
&cir;F to melt the asbestos fibers. Evaluation of the Omega process for the proposed rule indicates that when asbestos
is exposed to temperatures over 2000 
<!-- PJG 0040 degreeslatlong -->
&cir;F, the needle-like structure of asbestos fibers breaks down to form amorphous molten glass and asbestos fibers
are destroyed. The Omega petition was followed by a section 21 petition from Vitrifix, Inc., on November 26, 1990.
An earlier feasibility test conducted by Vitrifix for EPA's Office of Air Quality Planning and Standards demonstrated
that, under the test conditions utilizing high temperatures over 2000 
<!-- PJG 0040 degreeslatlong -->
&cir;F, ACM waste material was converted into non-asbestos material.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
EPA granted Omega's and Vitrifix's section 21 petitions on January 7, 1991, and February 20, 1991, respectively,
indicating its intent to initiate rulemakings under TSCA section 6 to amend the ABPO Rule to allow Omega and Vitrifix
to operate their proposed vitrification operations. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
On June 2, 1992 (57 FR 23183), EPA issued a proposal to amend the ABPO Rule to allow vitrification by Omega. EPA never
issued a proposed rule to allow vitrification by Vitrifix. EPA has reached the conclusion, as explained below, that
thermal processes that convert asbestos into non-asbestos material are not governed by the ABPO Rule. It was not the
intent of the ABPO Rule to regulate processes that permanently remove asbestos from the environment. Rather, the
objective was to prevent introduction of new asbestos into the environment. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 -->
II. Interpretation 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The ABPO Rule specifically prohibits ``processing for any use'' an asbestos-containing product listed in 40 CFR
763.165, including ``new uses of asbestos'' (40 CFR 763.167). The ABPO Rule, however, does not prohibit disposal
or processing for disposal. Because thermal conversion operations destroy asbestos fibers, such operations constitute
processing for disposal and do not constitute use of asbestos as contemplated by the ABPO Rule, and are, therefore,
not regulated by the ABPO Rule. EPA is revising its initial response on the issue of vitrification (as set forth in EPA's
March 29, 1990, letter to the State of California) to reconcile the function of these operations with the intent of
the Rule. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
This interpretation is consistent with EPA's overall intent when it promulgated the ABPO Rule. In general, EPA developed
the ABPO Rule to limit the introduction or continued marketing of additional asbestos products, rather than to regulate
disposal of products that were already in use when the ABPO Rule was issued. In keeping with the overall objective to
reduce entry of asbestos into commerce and into the environment, the ABPO Rule does not prohibit other distribution
activities undertaken solely to dispose of asbestos. (see generally 40 CFR 763.163). 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In some situations, thermal conversion operations may still be subject to the ABPO Rule. If the end product contains
asbestos that has not been converted into glass, for example, and the end product is used for any purpose, the operation
would be subject to the prohibition against processing for use in &sect;763.167 of the ABPO Rule. In that case, an exemption
would be necessary to engage in the activity.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
As building materials deteriorate, or as buildings are renovated or demolished, much of this asbestos waste will
require disposal. In a national survey of asbestos-containing friable materials in buildings, conducted in 1984,
EPA estimated that approximately 20 percent of all buildings have some asbestos-containing friable materials.
EPA further estimated that buildings targeted in the survey contained approximately 1.2 billion square feet of sprayed-
or trowelled-on ACM (in an estimated range of 18,000 to 365,000 buildings), and that approximately 16 percent (or
between 239,000 - 888,000 buildings) contain asbestos pipe and boiler insulation. EPA also estimates that approximately
31,000 schools contain asbestos. (

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

 - EPA Publication No. 560/5&hyph;84&hyph;006, October 1984, EPA Docket No OPPTS&hyph;62105). In addition to building
materials, asbestos is a component of automotive brakes, clutches and transmission components, as well as other
commercial and industrial friction materials which are eventually discarded for disposal after the components'
useful life. The magnitude of asbestos waste requiring disposal will place an increasing economic burden on society
as landfill capacity decreases. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
By converting asbestos into glass, vitrification provides an alternative to land disposal of asbestos waste and
produces a commercially useful non-asbestos product. Vitrification avoids costs of landfilling and of health costs
associated with exposure to asbestos waste. These costs could include a substantial burden on the individual and
society, including medical costs of treating asbestos-related diseases resulting from exposure to asbestos throughout
the life cycle of asbestos products and disposal of asbestos waste. The asbestos vitrification process destroys
asbestos and eliminates any risks from asbestos exposure which occur in the disposal and landfill stages of the asbestos
fiber life cycle.

III. Asbestos Regulations 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Several existing regulations provide protection against asbestos exposures and releases from asbestos conversion
operations if such facilities are established. Owners or operators of facilities that intend to commence operations
to convert asbestos-containing waste material into non-asbestos material are subject to permit and performance
requirements under the Asbestos NESHAP Standard and to certain reporting requirements under several other EPA regulations.
In addition, such companies would be subject to the worker protection requirements of the Occupational Safety and
Health Administration (OSHA) or of OSHA-approved state, or EPA asbestos worker protection standards. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Asbestos NESHAP Standard was established as an alternative to land disposal of asbestos waste (55 FR 48406, November
20, 1990). The Standard establishes permit and performance requirements, including a requirement to obtain EPA
approval to construct a facility, as well as monitoring, recordkeeping, and reporting requirements. During normal
operations, a company must demonstrate by laboratory analysis that ACM is completely destroyed. If laboratory testing
reveals that the output material contains asbestos, the company must reprocess the ACM, or dispose of it as asbestos-containing
waste material according to 40 CFR 61.150. Continuous monitoring requirements are also imposed under &sect;61.155
of the Asbestos NESHAP Standard. The Standard is designed to ensure that there are no visible air emissions and that
the output material contains no asbestos. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Asbestos thermal disposal facilities may also be subject to public disclosure and notification requirements under
the Emergency Planning and Community Right-to-Know Act (EPCRA) (42 U.S.C. 11001 11050). Among other things, EPCRA
requires emergency notification of any release of 1 pound or more of friable forms of asbestos to the appropriate State
Emergency Response Commission and Local Emergency Planning Committee. Section 313 of EPCRA requires submission
of Toxics Release Inventory (TRI) reports to EPA and designated State officials, including the amount of the toxic
chemical entering each environmental medium, such as air and water, annually. Asbestos thermal disposal facilities
would be subject to section 313 of EPCRA only if they fall within the Standard Industrial Classification (SIC) codes
20-39, they employ the equivalent of 10 full time employees, and they manufacture, process, or otherwise use a listed
toxic chemical in excess of the TRI reporting thresholds. Conversion of material containing friable forms of asbestos
into non-asbestos glass that is distributed in commerce is subject to section 313 reporting if the facility otherwise
meets the SIC Code and threshold requirements. Under the Pollution Prevention Act of 1990 (42 U.S.C. 13101&hyph;13109),
facilities that are required to file a TRI report under EPCRA section 313 must include with it certain additional information
about toxic chemical source reduction and recycling. Under the Comprehensive Emergency Response, Compensation
and Liability Act (CERCLA), certain releases must also be reported to the National Response Center and advertised
in local newspapers (42 U.S.C. 9663, 9611 (g)).
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Asbestos thermal disposal facilities are also subject to OSHA, EPA, or State laws for occupational exposure to asbestos
in the workplace (see e.g., 29 CFR part 1910 and 1926 and 40 CFR 763.120&hyph;763.125). These laws all set permissible
exposure limits to asbestos and establish required work practices to protect workers.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Asbestos thermal disposal facilities must also obtain construction approval from other appropriate Federal, State
and local authorities.

IV. Administrative Record
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
EPA has established a record of those documents EPA considered in addressing Omega's and Vitrifix's petitions. The
record consists of documents located in the file designated by docket control number, OPPTS&hyph;62105 located
at the TSCA Nonconfidential Information Center (NCIC). A public version of the record, without any confidential
business information, is available in the TSCA NCIC for reviewing and copying from noon to 4 p.m., Monday through Friday,
excluding legal holidays, at EPA headquarters, Rm. E&hyph;G102, 401 M St., SW., Washington, DC 20460.
