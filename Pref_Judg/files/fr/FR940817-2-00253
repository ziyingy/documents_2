Another type of second-tier procedure is schedule-controlled operant behavior (SCOB), which involves the maintenance
of behavior 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(performance) by response-dependent reinforcement (Rice, 1988). Different patterns of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
behavior and response rates are controlled by the relationship between response and later 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
reinforcement. SCOB affords a measure of learned behavior and with appropriate 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
experimental design may be useful for studying chemical-induced effects on motor, sensory, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
and cognitive function. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The primary endpoints for evaluation are agent-induced changes in response rate or 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
frequency and the temporal pattern of responding. Response rate is usually related to an 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
objective response, such as lever press or key peck, and differs according to the schedule of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
reinforcement. Response rates are expressed per unit of time. For some classes of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
chemicals, the direction of an effect on response rate can differ between low and high doses. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Agent-induced changes in temporal pattern of responding can occur independently of changes 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
in the rate and require analysis of the distribution of responses relative to reinforcement 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
schedule.

SCOB has been used to study the effects of psychoactive drugs on behavior and is 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
sensitive to many neurotoxicants, including methylmercury, solvents, pesticides, acrylamides, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
carbon monoxide, and organic and inorganic lead (Paule and McMillan, 1984; MacPhail 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
1985; Cory-Slechta, 1989; Rice, 1988). The experimental animal often serves as its own 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
control, and the procedure provides an opportunity to study a few animals extensively over a 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
relatively long period. SCOB typically requires motivational procedures, such as food 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
deprivation, and training sessions are usually required to establish a stable baseline of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
responding. Because of its sensitivity to neuroactive chemicals, SCOB has great potential for 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
use in second-tier assessments.

Neurophysiological studies are those that assess function either directly through 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
measurements of the electrical activity of the nervous system (electrophysiology) or indirectly 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
through measurements of peripheral organ functions controlled or modulated by the nervous 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
system (general physiology) (Dyer, 1987). When performed properly, neurophysiological 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
techniques provide information on the integrity of defined portions of the nervous system. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Many of the endpoints used in animals have also been used in humans to determine chemical-induced alterations in neurophysiological
function. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The term ``electrophysiology'' refers to the set of neurophysiological procedures that 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
study neural function through the direct measurement of the electrical activity generated by 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the nervous system (Dyer, 1987). A variety of electrophysiological procedures are available 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
for application to neurotoxicological problems, which range in scale from procedures that 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
employ microelectrodes to study the function of single nerve cells or restricted portions of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
them, to procedures that employ macroelectrodes to perform simultaneous recordings of the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
summed activity of many cells. The latter types of procedures have historically been used in 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
studies to detect or characterize the potential neurotoxicity of agents of regulatory interest. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Several macroelectrode procedures are discussed below.
