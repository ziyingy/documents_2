 (``the Act''), General Motors Corporation filed written notifications simultaneously with the Attorney General
and the Federal Trade Commission disclosing (1) the identities of the parties and (2) the nature and objectives of
a cooperative research project entitled ``Natural Gas Vehicle Technology Partnership''. The notifications were
filed for the purpose of invoking the Act's provisions limiting the recovery of antitrust plaintiffs to actual damages
under specified circumstances. Pursuant to section 6(b) of the Act, the parties to the project are Chrysler Corporation,
Highland Park, MI; Ford Motor Company, Dearborn, MI; and General Motors Corporation, Detroit, MI. The parties intend
to identify opportunities for joining aspects of their independent research and development efforts pertaining
to natural gas technology with respect to automotive systems. At least initially, the parties will concentrate their
investigations on natural gas storage techniques. The objectives are to avoid inefficient duplication of effort
and expense, improve general scientific knowledge in this area by answering fundamental questions, and accelerate
the development of this technology. To meet these objectives, the Partnership will collect, exchange, and analyze
research information regarding this technology; conduct tests and develop basic engineering techniques for use
in proof of theories and concepts in the relevant topics; and perform further acts allowed by the Act that would advance
the Partnership's objectives in this area.
