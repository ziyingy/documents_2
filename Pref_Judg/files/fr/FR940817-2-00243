Therefore, the acute exposure conditions possible in human laboratory studies may 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
provide us with very limited information about the long-term effects of chronic exposure.

3.6.2.4. Multiple exposures 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
In the environment and the workplace, persons are seldom 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
exposed to only a single chemical. Rather, they are most often exposed to complex mixtures 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
of chemicals, the relative concentrations of which may vary over time. For example, one 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
farmer had more than 50 different chemical products (pesticides, herbicides, solvents, metals, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
gases) with nervous system effects that he used, prepared, or stored in his work shed. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Chemicals used in industrial processes may also contain impurities or contaminants that may 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
produce neurotoxic effects or alter the neurotoxicity of the more abundant chemical species. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Chemical mixtures may have additive or potentiating effects not predictable from studies of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
single chemicals (Strong and Garruto, 1991). Human laboratory exposure studies 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
traditionally have employed one highly purified chemical or combinations of two chemicals 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(usually solvents) and thus may produce a spectrum of neurotoxic effects different from 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
environmental and occupational exposures. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Recently volatile organic compounds (VOCs) have been used in human exposure 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
studies (Otto and Hudnell, 1991). VOCs consist of multiple volatile compounds administered 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
at concentrations commonly found in indoor air from emissions by laminates, carpet, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
plastics, and other building and decorating materials. Although VOCs are thought to produce 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
primarily mucosal irritation and odors, reports of ``sick building syndrome'' and individual 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
sensitivity to indoor air contaminants suggest that other neurobehavioral mechanisms also 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
may be operating.

3.6.2.5. Generalizability and individual differences 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The results of field studies and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
laboratory exposure studies are most valuable when they can be extrapolated to the general 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
population. Studies conducted in male workers or in young, healthy volunteers may have 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
limited applicability to women or to people in other age ranges. It therefore is important to 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
conduct studies that include males and females of different ages and ethnic heritage. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Culture-sensitive neurobehavioral test methods are being developed and validated in the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
United States and other countries. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
While it is important to increase the generalizability of results, it is equally important 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
to know when results cannot be generalized. Studies should be specifically directed toward 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
identifying subsets of individuals who are more or less sensitive to neurotoxic insult or differ 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
in mode of expression. There are many examples of individual differences that alter 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
response to chemicals and drugs: phenylketonurics are more sensitive to dietary tyramine 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
and persons with variants of plasma pseudocholinesterase are more affected by some 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
neuromuscular blocking agents.

3.6.2.6. Veracity of neurobehavioral test results 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
In most epidemiologic and human 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
laboratory studies, research volunteers are highly motivated to perform well on tests of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
neurobehavioral function. Under voluntary conditions, actual neurobehavioral performance 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
may serve as a reasonable index of nervous system capabilities. Some studies, however, are 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
conducted in response to complaints of symptoms thought to be related to workplace, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
environmental, or therapeutic exposure to chemicals and drugs. The performance of research 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
participants with symptoms and complaints may be significantly affected (consciously or 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
unconsciously) by monetary rewards, emotional relief, or social gains from the validation of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
their complaints. Under these conditions, performance may or may not accurately reflect the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
capabilities of the nervous system and may lead to inaccurate conclusions about the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
magnitude of nervous system dysfunction or about putative chemical or drug etiologies. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In addition to suboptimal performance engendered by potential reinforcers or rewards, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
research participants involved in disputes over suspected neurotoxic exposures or in litigation 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
for monetary damages are likely to be experiencing significant emotional and behavioral 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
reactions from situational sources that can alter the outcome of neurobehavioral assessment. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Anxiety, depression, sleep disturbances, fatigue, worry, obsessive thoughts, and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
distractibility may contribute to less than optimal performance on motor and cognitive 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
neurobehavioral tasks, especially where speed and sustained concentration are important. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Under stressful conditions, it may be extremely difficult to differentiate between neurotoxic 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
and situational sources of observed functional impairment. Functional neurobehavioral tests 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
are not well equipped to distinguish between impairment from neurotoxicity and from 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
nonchemical variables. The use of functional tests in symptomatic populations requires great 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
care in interpretation. The development of validity scales and other control procedures for 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
assessing nonchemical influences on performance is greatly needed.

3.6.3. Cross-Species Extrapolation 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Many neurobehavioral tests were developed according to constructs of human 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
cognitive processes. The diverse measures of cognitive, sensory, and motor performance in 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
humans are therefore not easily compared with neurobehavioral function in animals. While it 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
may be possible to conceptually relate some animal and human neurobehavioral tests (e.g., 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
grip strength or signal detection), many procedural differences prevent direct comparison 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
between species. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
A more direct extrapolation from animals to man might be possible if the tests were 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
chosen on the basis of procedural similarity rather than on a conceptual basis (Anger, 1991). 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Stebbins and colleagues (1975) were successful in developing homologous procedures in 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
nonhuman primates for the psychophysical evaluation of antibiotic ototoxicity. Efforts to 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
develop comparable tests of memory and other neurobehavioral functions in animals and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
humans are under way (Stanton and Spear, 1990, Paule et al., 1990), and such efforts may 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
aid in cross-species extrapolation. Other procedurally defined methods, such as Pavlovian 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
conditioning (Solomon and Pendlebury, 1988), operant conditioning (Cory-Slechta, 1990), 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
signal detection, and psychophysical scaling techniques (Stebbins and Coombs, 1975), could 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
also be used to facilitate interspecies risk extrapolation. Deriving comparable 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
neurobehavioral assessment methods in animals and humans that will allow a more 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
straightforward extrapolation across species is of paramount importance for neurotoxicity risk 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
assessment.
