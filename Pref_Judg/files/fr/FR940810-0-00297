(7) Labels. (i) Labels shall be affixed to all products 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
containing asbestos and to all containers containing such 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
products, including waste containers. Where feasible, installed 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
asbestos products shall contain a visible label. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(ii) Labels shall be printed in large, bold letters on a 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
contrasting background. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(iii) Labels shall be used in accordance with the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
requirements of 29 CFR 1910.1200(f) of OSHA's Hazard

(iv) [Reserved] 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(v) Labels shall contain a warning statement against 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
breathing asbestos fibers. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(vi) The provisions for labels required by paragraphs 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(k)(2)(i) through (k)(2)(iii) do not apply where: 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(A) Asbestos fibers have been modified by a bonding agent, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
coating, binder, or other material, provided that the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
manufacturer can demonstrate that, during any reasonably 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
foreseeable use, handling, storage, disposal, processing, or 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
transportation, no airborne concentrations of asbestos fibers in 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
excess of the permissible exposure limit and/or excursion limit 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
will be released, or 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(B) Asbestos is present in a product in concentrations less 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
than 1.0 percent by weight. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(vii) When a building owner/or employer identifies 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
previously installed PACM and/or ACM, labels or signs shall be 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
affixed or posted so that employees will be notified of what 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
materials contain PACM and/or ACM. The employer shall attach 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
such labels in areas where they will clearly be noticed by 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
employees who are likely to be exposed, such as at the entrance 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
to mechanical room/areas. Signs required by paragraph (k)(5) of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
this section may be posted in lieu of labels so long as they 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
contain information required for labelling. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(8) Employee information and training. (i) The employer shall, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
at no cost to the employee, institute a training program for all 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
employees who install asbestos containing products and for all 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
employees who perform Class I through IV asbestos operations, and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
shall ensure their participation in the program. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(ii) Training shall be provided prior to or at the time of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
initial assignment and at least annually thereafter. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(iii) Training for Class I and II operations shall be the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
equivalent in curriculum, training method and length to the EPA 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Model Accreditation Plan (MAP) asbestos abatement worker training 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(40 CFR Part 763, Subpart E, Appendix C.). For employers whose 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Class II work with asbestos-containing material involves only the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
removal and/or disturbance of one generic category of building 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
material, such as roofing materials, flooring materials, siding 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
materials or transite panels, instead, such employer is required 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
to train employees who perform such work by providing a training 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
course which includes as a minimum all the elements included in 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
paragraph (k)(8)(vi) of this section and in addition, the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
specific work practices and engineering controls set forth in 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
paragraph (g) which specifically relate to that category. Such 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
course shall include ``hands-on'' training and shall take at least 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
8 hours. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(iv) Training for Class III employees shall be the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
equivalent in curriculum and training method to the 16-hour 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Operations and Maintenance course developed by EPA for 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
maintenance and custodial workers who conduct activities that 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
will result in the disturbance of ACM. [See 40 CFR 763.92(a)(2)]. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Such course shall include ``hands-on'' training in the use of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
respiratory protection and work practices and shall take at least 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
16 hours. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(v) Training for employees performing Class IV operations 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
shall be the equivalent in curriculum and training method to the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
awareness training course developed by EPA for maintenance and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
custodial workers who work in buildings containing asbestos- 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
containing material. [See 40 CFR 763.92 (a)(1)]. Such course 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
shall include available information concerning the locations of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
PACM and ACM, and asbestos-containing flooring material, or 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
flooring material where the absence of asbestos has not been 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
certified; and instruction in recognition of damage, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
deterioration, and delamination of asbestos containing building 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
materials. Such a course shall take at least 2 hours. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(vi) The training program shall be conducted in a manner 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
that the employee is able to understand. In addition to the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
content required by provisions in paragraph (k)(8)(iii) of this 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
section, the employer shall ensure that each such employee is 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
informed of the following: 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(A) Methods of recognizing asbestos, including the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
requirement in paragraph (k)(1) of this section to presume that 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
certain building materials contain asbestos; 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(B) The health effects associated with asbestos exposure; 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(C) The relationship between smoking and asbestos in 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
producing lung cancer; 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(D) The nature of operations that could result in exposure 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
to asbestos, the importance of necessary protective controls to 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
minimize exposure including, as applicable, engineering controls, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
work practices, respirators, housekeeping procedures, hygiene 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
facilities, protective clothing, decontamination procedures, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
emergency procedures, and waste disposal procedures, and any 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
necessary instruction in the use of these controls and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
procedures; including where Class III and IV work is performed, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the contents of ``Managing Asbestos In Place (EPA 20T&hyph;2003, July 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
1990) or its equivalent in content. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(E) The purpose, proper use, fitting instructions, and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
limitations of respirators as required by 29 CFR 1910.134; 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(F) The appropriate work practices for performing the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
asbestos job; 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(G) Medical surveillance program requirements; and
