A general overview of the Agency's approach in performing analysis of how to develop treatment standards for hazardous
wastes can be found in greater detail in Section III.A.1 of the preamble to the final rule that set land disposal restrictions
(LDR's) for the Third Third wastes (55 FR 22535, June 1, 1990). The framework for the development of the entire Land
Disposal Restrictions program was promulgated November 7, 1986. (51 FR 40572).

While the Agency prefers source reduction/pollution prevention and recycling/recovery over conventional treatment,
inevitably, some wastes (such as residues from recycling and inadvertent spill residues) will be generated. Thus,
standards based on treatment using ``best demonstrated available technology'' (BDAT) will be required to be developed
for these wastes if a final rule listing them as hazardous is promulgated.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Treatment standards typically are established based on the performance data from the treatment of the listed waste
or wastes with similar chemical and physical characteristics or similar concentrations of hazardous constituents.
Treatment standards are established for both wastewater and nonwastewater forms on a constituent-specific basis.
The constituents selected for regulation under the Land Disposal Restrictions Program are not necessarily limited
to those identified as present in the listings proposed in this action, but include those constituents or parameters
that will ensure that the technologies are operated properly.

Although data on waste characteristics and current management practices for wastes proposed in this action have
been gathered as part of the administrative record for this rule, the Agency has not completed its evaluation of the
usefulness of these data for developing specific treatment standards or assessing the capacity to treat (or recycle)
these wastes.

Some treatment technologies previously promulgated for newly identified hazardous organic wastes are: chemical
oxidation, wet air oxidation, activated sludge, steam stripping, activated carbon, solvent extraction, pyrolysis,
thermal desorption, UV photolysis, ozonation, and incineration. A current description of these technologies and
what types of wastes they are used to treat is available as a background document and can be obtained by contacting NTIS
(National Technical Information Service, 5285 Port Royal Road, Springfield, VA 22161, (703)487&hyph;4650) and
requesting document PB91&hyph;160556, ``Treatment Technology Document,'' L. Rosengrant, dated January, 1991,
USEPA&hyph;OSW.
