With respect to the feasibility of the enhanced nonroad 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
engine standards, the reader is referred to the discussion of the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
onhighway standards feasibility question. EPA believes that the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
technological approaches expected to be used for onhighway 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
engines will also find application for nonroad engines. More 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
specifically, diesel engine manufacturers make engines for both 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
onhighway and nonroad applications and some individual engine 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
families have been used for both. The Agency therefore projects 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
that the diesel engine developments applied to onhighway engines 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
will also need to be applied to nonroad engines. Although at 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
this time there are very few gasoline or alternative fuel (mainly 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
LPG) engines in these categories, such engines may find it easier 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
to meet the nonroad NO

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 standards than the onhighway standards 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
because of the steady-state nature of the in-use test. (Gasoline 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
may have difficulty with the evaporative hydrocarbon requirements 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
described below.) Optimization of these engines may be less 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
complex because transient fuel/air mixture control is less of a 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
concern. Alternative fuel related technology and longer-term 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
engine changes described for onhighway engines are also 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
candidates for use in the nonroad market. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
EPA is aware that packaging concerns can be an issue for 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
nonroad equipment, as they are for onhighway vehicles. Many 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
manufacturers of nonroad equipment will have to make changes to 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
their equipment designs if the profile of the engine is altered 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
substantially or there are other, new, requirements such as fuel 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
system changes. Moreover, there are also differences in use 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
between nonroad and onhighway engines which lead to different 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
load requirements. EPA believes that the four-year lead time 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
provided in the FIP will be sufficient for such issues to be 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
resolved but requests comment from equipment manufacturers on 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
unique packaging and use issues for nonroad equipment.

 EPA proposes to set the exhaust NMHC standard at 1.2 g/bhp-hr, the current onhighway heavy-duty diesel engine 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
standard. If EPA, in the national rule for CI nonroad engines at 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
or above 37 kw, finalizes a different standard for these engines, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
EPA will consider that standard for FIP engines as well. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Additionally, since these engines are a small but significant 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
contributor to HC inventories in the areas, EPA requests comment 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
on lower HC standards such as those described in the proposal for 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
onhighway heavy-duty vehicles (section B.(3)(b) of this 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
appendix). 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Once again paralleling the onhighway heavy-duty vehicle 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
provisions, EPA proposes to require nonroad equipment using 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
engines over 37 kw to have inherently low evaporative emissions. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Qualifying as low evaporative would require a demonstration that 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the equipment does not have the potential for significant 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
evaporative emissions when operating in high temperature 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
conditions. The demonstration (via testing or engineering 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
analysis) would be based on a maximum emission level of 5 grams 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
for combined diurnal (adjusted to a nominal 20 gallon fuel tank 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
volume), hot soak, running loss, and resting loss emissions, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
without an evaporative control system. Diurnal emissions would 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
be based on the engine and fuel system being exposed to ambient 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
heating from 72
<!-- PJG 0017 degreeslatlong -->
&cir; to 96
<!-- PJG 0017 degreeslatlong -->
&cir; F with a 40 percent fill of 9 psi RVP 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
fuel, or the parallel California requirements of 65
<!-- PJG 0017 degreeslatlong -->
&cir; to 105
<!-- PJG 0017 degreeslatlong -->
&cir; F 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
using 7 psi RVP fuel (if gasoline is used). EPA would have the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
option of testing to confirm the results. This requirement will 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
ensure that evaporative emissions remain low in use, which is 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
especially important given there is no inspection and maintenance 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
program for these engines. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
EPA data show most heavy-duty nonroad applications at or 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
above 37 kw use diesel fuel or liquefied petroleum gas (propane). 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Engines operating on these fuels are likely to be able to comply 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
with the low evaporative requirement without modification. The 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
low evaporative requirement, therefore, would affect the small 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
portion of the nonroad fleet operating on gasoline and would 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
prevent other changes in the makeup of the existing fleet that 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
could increase the potential for evaporative emissions. In 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
applications where gasoline-fueled engines are used, new engines 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
in this size range would have to be redesigned to operate low 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
evaporative. Very low volatility gasoline could be investigated 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
as an option to use of diesel or other fuels. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
EPA seeks comment on other options that could provide 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
assurance that hydrocarbon emissions would not increase from 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
these engines and that a shift to high volatility gasoline 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
engines would not occur. Commenters should review the treatment 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
of light-duty vehicles under the enhanced in-use compliance 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
program (section A. of this appendix).
