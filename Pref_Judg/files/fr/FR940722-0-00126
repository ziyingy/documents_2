157. In determining whether an applicant satisfies these financial thresholds, we will count the gross revenues
and total assets of the applicant as well as those of its investors with ``attributable'' interests. The subsection
that follows discusses what interests are attributable for these purposes. In addition, it sets forth exceptions
to these attribution rules for minority and women-owned applicants and for publicly-traded companies.

 As a general rule, the gross revenues and total assets of all investors in, and affiliates of, an applicant are counted
on a cumulative, fully-diluted basis for purposes of determining whether the $125 million/$500 million thresholds
have been exceeded, and on an individual basis regarding the $100 personal net worth standard.
<FOOTCITE>133</FOOTCITE>
 There are two exceptions to this rule, however. First, applicants that meet the definition of a small business may,
as discussed below, form consortia of small businesses that, on an aggregate basis, exceed the gross revenue/total
asset caps. Second, the gross revenues, total assets, personal net worth, and affiliations of any investor in the
applicant are not considered so long as the investor holds less than 25 percent of the applicant's passive equity.
For corporations, we shall use the term passive equity investors to mean investors who hold only non-voting stock
or 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
de minimis
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 amounts of voting stock that include no more than five percent of the voting interests. Where different classes of
stock are held, however, the total amount of equity must still be less than 25 percent to meet this requirement. For
partnerships, the term means limited partnership interests that do not have the power to exercise control of the entity.
<FOOTCITE>134</FOOTCITE>
 The passive investor exception will be available, however, only so long as the applicant remains under the control
of one or more entities or individuals (defined as the ``control group'') and the control group holds at least 25 percent
of the applicant's equity and, in the case of corporate applicants, at least 50.1 percent of the voting stock.
<FOOTCITE>135</FOOTCITE>
 In the case of partnership applicants, the control group must hold all the general partnership interests. Winning
bidders are required to identify on their long-form applications the identity of the members of this control group
and the means of ensuring control (such as a voting trust agreement). The gross revenues, total assets and personal
net worth (if applicable) of each member of the control group and each member's affiliates will be counted toward the
$125 million gross revenues/$500 million total assets thresholds or the individual $100 million personal net worth
standard, regardless of the size of the member's total interest in the applicant.

Applicants must be prepared to demonstrate that the limited partners do not have influence over the affairs of the
applicant that is inconsistent with their roles as passive investors. For purposes of our rules, we presume that any
general partner has the power to control a partnership. Therefore, each general partner in a partnership will be considered
part of the partnership's control group.

159. The attribution levels we have selected here are intended to balance the competing considerations that apply
in this particular context and may differ from those we have used in other circumstances. As a general matter, the 25
percent limitation on equity investment interests will serve as a safeguard that the very large entities who are excluded
from bidding in these blocks do not, through their investments in qualified firms, circumvent the gross revenue/total
asset caps. At the same time, it will afford qualified bidders a reasonable measure of flexibility in obtaining needed
financing from other entities, while ensuring that such entities do not acquire controlling interests in the eligible
bidders.
<FOOTCITE>136</FOOTCITE>
 Similarly, the five percent threshold for attributing revenues of investors with voting stock in corporate applicants
is designed to keep ineligible parties from exerting undue control over eligible firms.
<FOOTCITE>137</FOOTCITE>
 For all of these reasons, we also will attribute the gross revenues and total assets of entities, or the personal net
worth of individuals, that otherwise constitute ``affiliates'' of the applicant.

Qualified Woman and Minority-Owned ``Entrepreneurs''.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 As discussed above, the record demonstrates that women and minorities have especially acute problems in obtaining
financing, due in part to discriminatory lending practices by private financial institutions. To address these
special problems and to afford women and minority-owned businesses more flexibility in attracting financing, it
is necessary to provide these entities with an alternative, somewhat more relaxed option regarding the attribution
of revenues of passive investors. Under this alternative standard, we will not attribute to the applicant the gross
revenues, assets, or net worth of any single investor in a minority or woman-owned applicant unless it holds more than
49.9 percent of the passive equity (which is defined to include as much as five percent of a corporation's voting stock).
To guard against abuses, however, the control group of applicants choosing this option would have to own at least 50.1
percent of the applicant's equity, as well as retain control and hold at least 50.1 percent of the voting stock.
<FOOTCITE>139</FOOTCITE>
 As discussed above with regard to general eligibility to bid in the entrepreneurs' blocks, winning bidders must identify
on their long-form applications a control group (this time consisting entirely of minorities and/or women or entities
100 percent owned and controlled by minorities and/or women) and the gross revenues and net worth of each member of
the control group and each member's affiliates will be counted toward the $125 million gross revenue/$500 million
total asset thresholds or the individual $100 million personal net worth limitation, regardless of the size of the
member's total interest in the applicant.
