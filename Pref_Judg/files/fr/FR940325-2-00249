SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
 The Forest Service and Bureau of Land Management (BLM) are developing an ecosystem-based management strategy for
Pacific anadromous fish (i.e., salmon, steelhead, and sea-run cutthroat trout) habitat on lands they administer
in eastern Oregon and Washington, and portions of Idaho and California. This anadromous fish habitat and watershed
conservation strategy (commonly referred to as ``PACFISH'') is being developed to respond to large declines in anadromous
fish populations and widespread degradation of habitat condition.

The Agencies are considering adopting interim management direction to halt degradation and to ensure that actions
taken during the 18 month period needed to complete geographically-specific environmental impact statements (EISs)
do not have adverse environmental effects that could limit options for protection and management of anadromous fish
habitat. The EA is intended to guide the Agencies to decide: (1) Whether to continue current management practices
or to institute interim direction while longer-term management options are evaluated in the EISs; (2) what management
direction should be applied during the interim period; (3) which watersheds interim direction would apply to; and
(4) which categories of projects and activities might be affected.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The EA describes five interim management alternatives and evaluates their effects on the physical, biological,
and human environment. The preferred alternative is intended to provide a consistent approach for halting the degradation
of aquatic and riparian ecosystems, and maintaining and beginning restoration of aquatic and riparian habitat conditions
while the EISs are being completed. The preferred alternative would apply to proposed activities and to ongoing projects
that are determined on a case-by-case basis to pose an unacceptable risk to riparian and aquatic ecosystems or at risk
stocks. The interim management direction does not authorize, fund, or carry-out any project decisions, nor does
it compel any changes in the physical environment. This interim direction includes management measures and standards
and guidelines to be incorporated into separate project decisions while the Agencies evaluate a longer term strategy
for anadromous fish protection. The analysis shows that the environmental effects of the interim management direction
will be minimal for all alternatives considered, but adoption of some alternatives would begin important changes
in management of habitat crucial to the survival of the remaining anadromous fish populations.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
For the Forest Service, the interim management direction is expected to result in non-significant amendments to
the forest plans of the affected forests. The BLM would issue an instructional memorandum to affected districts.
Prior to a decision on the interim management direction, the Agencies will complete Endangered Species Act (ESA)
consultation with the National Marine Fisheries Service and U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service. Project decisions will
be preceded by the appropriate level of environmental analysis in compliance with the National Environmental Policy
Act and other Federal environmental laws. Modifications of some ongoing projects or activities may be necessary
depending upon the final decision reached regarding the interim management direction.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
To assist the Agencies in considering comments on the proposed action and the alternatives, comments should be as
specific as possible. It also is helpful if comments refer to specific pages in the document. It is important that those
interested in this proposed action participate by the close of the comment period so that substantive comments and
objections are made available to the Agencies at a time when they can meaningfully consider and respond to them. The
officials responsible for making the final decision on the interim management direction will be the Secretaries
or their designees.
