The five programmatic and management criteria are closely related to each other. They are considered as a whole in
judging the overall quality of an application. Points are awarded only to applications which are responsive to this
announcement and these criteria. The five evaluation criteria are: 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 -->
(1) Long-Range Goals and Available Resources (15 Points) 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
(a) The application explains how the specific environmental regulatory enhancement goal relates to the proposed
project. The description includes local objectives related to the program purpose of this announcement. The discussion
should highlight specific environmental regulatory needs and explain how the community intends to achieve the goal.
It documents the type of involvement and support of the community in the planning and implementation of the project.
The application has a clearly delineated strategy to improve the capability of the governing body of a tribe to regulate
environmental quality through enhancing local capacity to perform necessary regulatory functions. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(b) Available resources (other than ANA) which will assist, and be coordinated with the project, are described. These
resources should be documented by letters or documents of commitment of resources, not merely letters of support.
``Letters of support'' merely express another organization's endorsement of a proposed project. Support letters
are not binding commitment letters or documents that factually establish the authenticity of other resources. Letters
and other documents of commitment are binding in that they specifically state the nature, amount and conditions under
which another agency or organization will support a project funded with ANA monies. For example, a letter from another
Federal agency or foundation pledging a commitment of $200,000 in construction funding to complement proposed ANA
funded pre-construction activity is evidence of a firm funding commitment. These resources may be human, natural
or financial, and may include other Federal and non-Federal resources. Applicant statements that additional funding
will be sought from other specific sources is not considered a binding commitment of outside resources.

(2) Organizational Capabilities and Qualifications (15 Points) 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
(a) The management and administrative structure of the applicant is described and explained. Evidence of the applicant's
ability to manage a project of the scope proposed is well documented. The application clearly shows the successful
management of prior or current projects of similar scope by the organization, and/or by the individuals designated
to manage or consult on the project. The tribe itself may not have experience to meet this requirement but the staff
and consultants that it has agreed to hire should contain the required experience and capability. The applicant should
clearly describe any previous or current activities of all participants in support of environmental regulatory
enhancement. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(b) Position descriptions or resumes of key personnel, including those of consultants, are presented. The position
descriptions and resumes relate specifically to the staff proposed in the Approach Page and in the proposed Budget
of the application. Position descriptions very clearly describe each position and its duties and clearly relate
to the personnel staffing required to achieve the project objectives. Resumes indicate that the proposed staff are
qualified to carry out the project activities. Either the position descriptions or the resumes set forth the qualifications
that the applicant believes are necessary for overall quality management of the project.
