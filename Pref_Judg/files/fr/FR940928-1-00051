SUMMARY:
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
 EPA is exploring the possibility of issuing significant new use rules (SNURs) for certain uses of elemental lead (Pb)
and lead compounds under section 5(a)(2) of the Toxic Substances Control Act (TSCA). The SNURs would require persons
to notify EPA at least 90 days before commencing the manufacture, import, or processing of lead and lead compounds
for uses identified by the Agency as significant new uses. The significant new use notice (SNUN) would provide EPA
with the opportunity to evaluate the intended use and associated activities and to prevent potentially unreasonable
risk of injury to human health and the environment from occurring. EPA is issuing this ANPR to: (1) Communicate its
intention to regulate significant new uses of elemental lead and lead compounds; (2) identify components of its proposed
regulatory approach; (3) request comment on issues related to this approach; and (4) request comment and information
on existing uses of lead that would help support EPA's selection of proposed criteria for defining significant new
uses of lead. The Agency is particularly concerned with products the use of which may pose unreasonable risks to children.
The information submitted in response to this ANPR will help EPA design an effective and efficient strategy for regulating
significant new uses of lead.

SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
 Reducing human exposure to lead and lead contamination of the environment continue to be priority issues for EPA.
Exposure to lead can result in a variety of adverse human health effects in both children and adults. Recent research
and scientific evidence indicate that human health effects (e.g., impaired neurological development) occur at
low exposure levels. Lead contamination of the environment is causing degradation of habitat and lead products have
been implicated in the death of individual animals from several species. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
In response to these problems, EPA has undertaken a variety of regulatory, programmatic, and research efforts to
evaluate and address the environmental impacts of lead. Since 1991, Agency activities have been coordinated through
the 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Strategy for Reducing Lead Exposures
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
. This strategy includes regulatory and pollution prevention activities, a lead abatement program for ``in-place''
lead, and a research program. The promulgation of SNURs for elemental lead and lead compounds is part of EPA's multi-faceted
strategy for reducing unacceptable lead exposures. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
EPA's efforts are designed to reduce exposure to lead by: (1) Preventing new uses and phasing out current uses of lead
that pose unreasonable risks; (2) controlling lead emissions; (3) managing the disposal of lead-containing wastes;
(4) addressing in-place lead; and (5) supporting research to improve EPA's ability to assess and reduce lead-related
risks.

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Section 5(a)(2) of TSCA (15 U.S.C. 2604(a)(2)) authorizes EPA to determine that a use of a chemical substance is a ``significant
new use.'' The Agency must make this determination by rule after considering all relevant factors, including those
listed in section 5(a)(2). Section 5(a)(2) factors generally relate to the extent to which a use changes the volume
of a chemical's production or the type, form, magnitude, or duration of exposure to it. Once EPA determines that a use
of a chemical substance is a significant new use, section 5(a)(1)(B) of TSCA requires persons to submit a notice to
EPA at least 90 days before they manufacture, import, or process the chemical substance for that use. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Persons subject to a SNUR would comply with the same notice requirements and EPA regulatory procedures as submitters
of premanufacture notices (PMNs) under section 5(a)(1)(A) of TSCA. In particular, these requirements include the
information submission provisions of section 5(b) and (d)(1), the exemptions authorized by section 5(h)(1), (2),
(3), and (5), and the regulations at 40 CFR part 720. The premanufacture notification process provides EPA the opportunity
to review the particular use of the chemical substance and make a reasonable risk determination prior to the use's
commercial introduction. Following its review, EPA may take regulatory action under section 5(e), 5(f), 6, or 7 to
control the activities for which it has received a SNUN. If EPA does not take action, section (5)(g) of TSCA requires
EPA to explain in the 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 -->
Federal Register
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 its reasons for not taking action. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Persons who intend to export a substance identified in a final SNUR are subject to the export notification provisions
of TSCA section 12(b). The regulations that interpret section 12(b) appear at 40 CFR part 707. Persons who import a
substance identified in a final SNUR must certify that they are in compliance with TSCA, which includes the SNUR requirements.
The EPA import certification requirements appear at 40 CFR part 707.

II. Uses of Lead 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Lead is a soft, gray metallic element mined from rock and found in its natural state all over the world. It is virtually
indestructible and non-biodegradable. Its malleability, low melting point, ease of processing, abundance, low
cost, density, lubricant properties, and durability give it good functional value. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In 1992, the U.S. Bureau of Mines reported that U.S. industries consumed over 1.24 million tons of lead. Of this quantity,
nearly 81 percent was used to manufacture storage batteries and 5 percent was used in the ammunition industry. Other
uses include: Glass and ceramics; lead chemical products; cable coverings; lead sheet; lead solder; casting lead;
pigments; pipes, traps, and other extruded products; brass and bronze; other metal products; heat stabilizers;
and bearing metals. Manufacturers use lead in its elemental form, in compounds including lead oxides and lead chromate,
and in alloys (e.g., brass and solder).

III. Human Health Effects 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Exposure to lead can produce a spectrum of human health effects across a wide range of exposure levels. Recent studies
indicate that these toxic effects may occur at exposure levels considerably lower than previously recognized. Accordingly,
the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) has established the threshold of concern for blood lead (PbB),
the most common index of lead exposure, at 10 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=6 f=1 -->
m
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
g/dL. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Young children and fetuses are especially vulnerable to lead: the nervous systems are developing and lead is absorbed
into the blood stream more easily than in adults. High PbB levels (>40&hyph;60 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=6 f=1 -->
m
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
g/dL) in children are associated with anemia, mental retardation, and encephalopathy. At extremely high levels
(>100 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=6 f=1 -->
m
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
g/dL), death may occur. There is also a concern that high lead exposure might play a role in spontaneous abortions.
At lower exposure levels, lead has been linked to impaired cognitive performance, delayed neurological and physical
development, decreased birth weight, and interference with heme synthesis and Vitamin D metabolism. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Recent research indicates that deficits in IQ and other measures of cognitive functions have been associated with
PbB levels of 10

Air Quality Criteria for Lead, Supplement to 1986 Addendum
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 (USEPA, 1990), has identified the following relationships between lead exposure and human health: 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
1. Deficits in mental indices have been found in infants with maternal or umbilical cord PbB levels as low as 6&hyph;7

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
2. Low birth weights and decreased gestation age, factors that may influence early neurological development have
been associated with infants born to women with PbB levels above 12&hyph;14

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
g/dL. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
3. Early childhood growth reductions have been associated with PbB levels from 5&hyph;35 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In its study 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Measuring Lead Exposure in Infants, Children, and Other Sensitive Populations
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
, the National Academy of Sciences documented a similar range of effects (NAS, 1993). The Academy noted that PbB concentrations
around 10 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=6 f=1 -->
m
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
g/dL are associated with disturbances in early physical and mental growth and in later intellectual functioning
and academic achievement. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Although Federal government interest in lead poisoning has primarily focused on children, there is substantial
evidence that lead exposures can produce adverse health effects in adults. Of great concern is evidence that elevated
PbB levels have been associated with slight increases in blood pressure. Because lead is stored in bone, it may be mobilized
during periods of stress or greater metabolic demands for calcium (e.g., pregnancy).

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 -->
IV. Environmental Effects 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Lead is one of the most common toxic substances found in large and small animals. Lead poisoning is the most frequently
diagnosed toxicological problem in veterinary medicine; its occurrence has been reported in all domestic species
and in several species of zoo animals. Lead poisoning has also affected many major species of waterfowl in North America
and has been reported in many birds elsewhere in the world. Sources of these exposures have typically included lead
wastes, lead paint, spent lead shot, fishing sinkers, and contaminated forage near smelters and roadways. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Laboratory and field data show that at high concentrations, lead can affect certain plants and inhibit photosynthesis,
reduce growth, and alter species composition. Other studies indicate that high lead concentrations alter the composition
of soil microbial communities and inhibit invertebrate activity resulting in delayed decomposition of organic
matter, reduced nutrient supply, and altered soil properties, such as lower organic content. Lead is toxic to many
phyla of aquatic biota. Water lead concentrations as low as 19 to 30 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=6 f=1 -->
m
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
g/L have been associated with increased mortality and impaired reproduction in aquatic invertebrates. Aquatic
vertebrates (e.g., fish) appear to be even more sensitive. Studies have shown that freshwater aquatic organisms
are more sensitive to lead in soft than hard water. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 -->
V. Controlling Lead Exposure 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Over the last two decades EPA has taken a number of actions to control exposure to lead. Most notable of these actions
has been the virtual removal of lead from gasoline. As a result of this action and the phase-out of lead solder in food
cans by domestic manufacturers, it is estimated that the average PbB level in children has declined by 75 percent (from
about 17 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=6 f=1 -->
m
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
g/dL to 4 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=6 f=1 -->
m
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
g/dL) over the past 15 years. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Despite this progress, several factors have prompted EPA to identify other sources of on-going lead exposure, especially
exposure among children, and initiate additional actions. First, the level of concern at which lead may adversely
affect human health continues to decrease. CDC revised its level of concern from 25 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=6 f=1 -->
m
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
g/dL to 10 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=6 f=1 -->
m
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
g/dL in 1990. Second, nearly nine percent of children continue to have PbB levels in excess of CDC's level of concern,
with a higher incidence of elevated PbB reported for minorities living in urban areas (CDC, 1994). Third, other sources
of lead (e.g., lead-based paint and drinking water) are the primary sources of exposure for segments of the population.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
To coordinate EPA's lead activities, the Agency published the 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Strategy for Reducing Lead Exposures
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 in February 1991, the goal of which is to reduce lead exposures to the fullest extent practicable. Two objectives have
been used to set program priorities and gauge program success: (1) Reduce significantly the incidence of PbB levels
above 10 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=6 f=1 -->
m
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
g/dL in children while taking into account the associated costs and benefits; and (2) reduce significantly, through
voluntary and mandatory actions, unacceptable lead exposures that are anticipated to pose risks to children, the
general public, or the environment. EPA plans to achieve the strategy's goal and objectives through implementation
of research, abatement, and regulatory and pollution prevention programs. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 -->
A. Research Program 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The purposes of the research program are to: (1) Locate and assess, in terms of geography and media, the most serious
lead risks; and (2) develop methods and tools to reduce these risks cost-effectively. Examples of accomplishments
and on-going efforts include evaluation of low-cost lead-based paint (LBP) abatement techniques, development
of LBP abatement sampling techniques and protocols, studies to analyze the effectiveness of corrosion control technologies
in small public water supply systems to reduce lead levels, and continued development and review of the Integrated
Environmental Uptake/Biokinetic (UBK) Model to assess the relationship between environmental lead exposure and
PbB levels.

Lead-based paint
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
. EPA's abatement program for ``in-place'' lead focuses on two major sources of exposure: LBP and lead-contaminated
soil. LBP is the most serious source of children's lead exposure. The Agency for Toxic Substances and Disease Registry
(ATSDR) estimates that 12 million children are exposed to LBP at home and that nearly 6 million are exposed in homes
with the highest concentrations of lead (houses built prior to 1940). Under a Memorandum of Understanding, EPA works
closely with the U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD) to address the LBP problem. EPA's efforts
in this area have intensified with the enactment of Title X, ``The Residential Lead-Based Paint Hazard Reduction
Act of 1992'' (the Act). Subtitle B of the Act, which amended TSCA by creating Title IV, provides for a comprehensive
national approach to dealing with LBP in the nation's housing stock. One of the purposes of the Act is to reorient the
Federal program from abatement of all residential LBP to abatement and in-place management of priority LBP hazards.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
To date, EPA's LBP program has successfully implemented several initiatives. The Agency has established regional
training and information centers and implemented a nationwide public outreach and education campaign. The outreach
and education campaign consists of the National Lead Information Center, which operates the Lead Hotline and the
Lead Clearinghouse. In addition, the National Lead Poisoning Prevention Education Campaign disseminates important
information on residential LBP hazards through radio and television public service announcements. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Act also directs EPA to develop several regulations designed to address residential LBP exposures. Under TSCA
section 402(a)(1), EPA is developing training and certification requirements for individuals and contractors
engaged in LBP activities (e.g., risk assessment, inspection, and abatement). These regulations will establish
standards for performing LBP activities. This rulemaking also includes procedures for State and Indian Tribe program
authorization under TSCA section 404(a) and a Model State Program under TSCA section 404(d). EPA issued proposed
regulations under TSCA sections 402(a)(1), 404(a), and 404(d) in the

Under TSCA section 403, EPA is developing health-based standards for identifying lead-based paint hazards, lead-contaminated
dust, and lead-contaminated soil, and on July 14, 1994, issued guidance on this subject. EPA is developing regulations
under TSCA section 406 and section 1018 of the Act requiring the disclosure of potential LBP hazards prior to renovation
of target housing and the disclosure of known LBP and LBP hazards prior to the sale or lease of target housing.

 The Notice of Proposed Rulemaking for TSCA section 406 was published on March 9, 1994 (59 FR 11108). In conjunction
with this rulemaking, the Agency made a pamphlet on LBP hazards available to the public for review and comment (March
9, 1994; 59 FR 11119). EPA expects to issue a proposed rule under section 1018 of the Act later in 1994.

Target housing is defined by section 1004 of Title X to be ``any housing constructed prior to 1978, except housing for
the elderly or persons with disabilities (unless any child who is less than 6 years of age resides or is expected to reside
in such housing for the elderly or persons with disabilities) or any 0&hyph;bedroom dwelling. In the case of jurisdictions
which banned the sale or use of lead-based paint prior to 1978, the Secretary [of Housing and Urban Development], at
the Secretary's discretion, may designate an earlier date.''

Under TSCA section 405(b), EPA has established the National Lead Laboratory Accreditation Program (NLLAP) and developed
protocols, criteria, and minimum performance standards for laboratories that analyze paint chip, dust, and soil
samples for lead. The purpose of this program is to ensure that reliable laboratory services are available to support
lead hazard detection and abatement activities. The Agency, in the first phase of the NLLAP program, is publishing
proficiency test results for laboratories on a state-by-state basis. To implement the second phase of the program,
EPA has executed Memoranda of Understanding with the American Industrial Hygiene Association (memorandum from
Scott McMoran, USEPA to Gordon Banks, AIHA, December 10, 1993) and the American Association for Laboratory Accreditation
(memorandum from Scott McMoran, USEPA to John Locke, AALA, December 1, 1993) establishing these institutions as
laboratory accrediting organizations. The NLLAP program will recognize laboratories accredited by these organizations
as capable of analyzing paint chip, dust, and soil samples for lead.

Lead-contaminated soil
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
. The other major area of focus for EPA's abatement program for ``in-place'' lead is lead-contaminated soil. The Agency
has completed a review draft of the Urban Soil Lead Abatement Demonstration Project (Three City Study) (USEPA, 1993).
In addition, the Agency issued revised guidance on soil lead screening levels for Comprehensive Environmental Response,
Compensation, and Liability Act and Resource Conservation and Recovery Act (RCRA) sites on July 14, 1994. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Three City Study, authorized by section 111(a)(6) of the Superfund Amendments and Reauthorization Act (SARA),
evaluated the effectiveness of soil lead abatement for reducing PbB levels in inner city children. The project, which
analyzed data from Baltimore, Boston, and Cincinnati, demonstrated a clear relationship between environmental
lead and PbB. Analysis of the data (peer review to be completed in 1994) indicates that lead in dust and paint were major
contributors to elevated PbB levels in children and that PbB levels responded to remedial activity. Furthermore,
analytical results from the three cities suggest that strategies to reduce overall lead exposure at a site and protect
human health need to consider an array of sources including lead in soil, dust, and paint.

C. Regulatory and Pollution Prevention Program 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The third component of EPA's lead strategy is the regulatory and pollution prevention program. This program, which
primarily focuses on existing and new uses and releases of lead, addresses lead exposures that are amenable to regulatory
control or, in some cases, voluntary measures. These controls include waste management requirements, emissions
restrictions, and limits on lead in products. Under its lead regulatory and pollution prevention program, EPA has
completed a major rulemaking and initiated several other important actions. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Agency published final regulations, promulgating maximum contaminant level goals and national primary drinking
water regulations for controlling lead and copper in drinking water (40 CFR parts 141 and 142) on June 7, 1991 (56 FR
26460). These regulations established a maximum contaminant level goal at 0 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=6 f=1 -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=6 f=1 -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
g/l for lead. Public water supply systems failing to meet the action level based on sampling methods prescribed in
the rule must initiate treatment actions that may include corrosion control, source water treatment, lead service
line replacement, and public education. To date, EPA has received sampling data reports from three rounds of sampling:
Round one covered large public water supply systems; round two covered large and medium-sized systems; and round
three covered medium and small systems. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In an action to protect wildlife, EPA proposed regulations under section 6(a) of TSCA, limiting the manufacture,
processing, and distribution in commerce in the United States, of certain size lead fishing sinkers on March 9, 1994
(59 FR 11122). Granting a section 21 petition by the Environmental Defense Fund, EPA proposed this regulatory action
in response to information submitted in the petition which indicated that common loons, trumpeter swans, and birds
from other avian species had died of lead poisoning after ingesting lead fishing sinkers. This proposed rulemaking
also includes sinkers containing zinc because studies and other information obtained by EPA suggests that zinc adversely
affects waterbirds and can cause mortality in avian species. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Agency's regulatory efforts are complemented by initiatives to achieve voluntary compliance with lead exposure
reduction goals. For example, EPA is currently participating in efforts by National Sanitation Foundation International
to develop a voluntary lead leaching standard for kitchen, bar, and lavatory faucets. The objective of this standard
is to reduce the quantity of lead that leaches from brass faucets. Products that meet the standard based on test samples
and analysis would be certified and appropriately labeled, indicating to consumers that the product contributes
less lead to drinking and cooking water than faucets that fail to meet the certification requirements.

VI. Review and Control of New Uses of Lead 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 -->
A. Rationale 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
To date, EPA's programmatic efforts have focused on existing uses of lead, because there is substantial evidence
that exposure to lead has adverse human health and environmental impacts. The Agency, however, is also concerned
about new uses of lead, because they may result in new or increased exposures which may present an unreasonable risk
of injury to human health and the environment. New or increased exposure to lead may arise from: (1) Increases in the
volume of lead consumed; (2) increases in the concentration of lead in products; (3) new products containing lead;
and (4) changes in product design that increase the amount of lead released from a product. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
EPA believes that its concern about new uses is justified in light of lead's physical properties and low cost, attributes
which make it an attractive raw material for a broad variety of commercial and consumer products. Consequently, the
Agency believes that the regulation of existing uses alone may not be sufficient to reduce lead exposures to the greatest
extent practicable. EPA should also evaluate and, if necessary, regulate new uses of lead before opportunities for
exposure occur. The Agency further believes that addressing risks prior to commercial use is more effective than
responding to exposures and risks after the use is introduced commercially. Because children are especially vulnerable
to the impacts of lead, EPA is particularly concerned about new uses that could present risks to children. Consistent
with the Agency's overall lead risk reduction program, EPA is also seeking to address risks to adults and the environment
from new uses of lead. The Agency, therefore, is exploring the possibility of issuing significant new use rules for
certain uses of elemental lead and lead compounds under section 5(a) of TSCA. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 -->
B. The SNUR Process 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Section 5(a) of TSCA provides EPA with the authority to screen new uses of a chemical substance to determine whether
these uses should be regulated. This screening function is accomplished through the SNUR process. EPA may issue a
SNUR for a chemical substance after considering relevant factors, including: (1) The projected volume of manufacturing
and processing of a chemical substance; (2) the extent to which a use changes the type or form of human or environmental
exposure to a chemical substance; (3) the extent to which a use increases the magnitude and duration of human or environmental
exposure to a chemical substance; and (4) the reasonably anticipated manner and methods of manufacturing, processing,
distribution in commerce, and disposal of a chemical substance. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Having considered all the relevant factors, EPA can then issue a SNUR that identifies the chemical substance and specifies
one or more uses as significant new uses. EPA also has the option to publish a SNUR that defines any use meeting specified
criteria as a significant new use. Under a third option, EPA may list all past and existing uses of the substance and
define any use not on that list as a significant new use. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
After EPA promulgates a SNUR for a chemical substance, TSCA requires that a SNUN be submitted to the Administrator
at least 90 days before the start of manufacturing or processing of the significant new use(s). Based on the information
provided in the SNUN and other relevant data submitted, the Agency will evaluate the risk that the use presents to human
health and the environment. EPA can, for good cause, extend the review period for a maximum of 90 days. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
If, based on its review, the Agency determines that the significant new use may present an unreasonable risk of injury
to human health or the environment but lacks the information necessary to make a definitive finding, it can issue an
order to prohibit or limit the manufacturing, processing, or distribution in commerce of the use while it continues
its risk evaluation. Once EPA has made its risk finding, it can either: (1) Take long-term action to prohibit or limit
the manufacturing, processing, or distribution in commerce of the use if the use presents or will present unreasonable
risk of injury to human health and the environmentm, or (2) take no action if it finds that there is no unreasonable risk.
When making a determination of unreasonable risk, EPA considers the risks of the use to human health and the environment,
the benefits of the use, the availability of substitutes, and the economic consequences of any limits on the use. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In short, section 5 of TSCA gives EPA the authority to promulgate a SNUR based on factors related to exposure and volume.
A SNUR requires notification of the significant new use(s). Following notification, the Agency evaluates the risk
of the use(s) to determine whether it should limit or prohibit the use(s). EPA solicits comment on the effectiveness
of using this approach for lead, as well as alternative approaches to protect human health and the environment from
lead exposures.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 -->
C. Formulating an Approach for Lead 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
To date, EPA has promulgated SNURs for substances where existing use is limited to a few applications and products.
These SNURs typically identify all existing uses of the substance that is the subject of the SNUR. Lead, however, is
used in hundreds of products and processes across many industries, due to its physical properties and low cost. The
widespread use of lead makes the complete identification of all existing uses of lead extremely difficult. The traditional
approach of first identifying all existing uses of a chemical substance, therefore, may not be appropriate for development
of a lead SNUR. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
To regulate new uses of lead in a sensible and protective manner, EPA intends to establish an alternative approach
that can be used to identify significant new uses. This approach consists of two components: a targeting strategy
and criteria for defining significant new uses. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
1. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Targeting strategy
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
. The widespread use of lead in commerce has prompted EPA to develop a strategy that targets new lead uses where exposure
to lead could reasonably be expected to occur as a result of the designed or anticipated use of the product. For example,
the Agency would be concerned about a new use of lead in a product where lead could be inadvertently ingested by children
(e.g., use of lead-based artists paints in home studios contributing lead to household dust). The strategy also targets
new uses of lead that could result in adult and environmental exposure (e.g., heated lead solder for household electrical
repairs that could produce inhalable vapors, spent lead shot that could contaminate habitat adjacent to shooting
ranges). In contrast, EPA does not currently plan to focus on uses where human and/or environmental exposure would
be less likely to occur (e.g., new circuit boards used in computers and other electronics products, solder designed
for industrial use in the electronics industry, batteries). 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Agency believes that using exposure to target new uses of lead is an appropriate tool and consistent with the SNUR
authority under section 5 of TSCA. If, in response to a SNUR that EPA promulgates for specific lead uses, the Agency
receives a SNUN, section 5 requires EPA to determine if further regulatory action is warranted by assessing whether
the use presents or will present an unreasonable risk of injury to human health or the environment. By using exposure
as the criterion for identifying new uses that would be subject to a SNUR, EPA intends to limit the SNUR and its notification
requirements to those new uses where exposure is likely and thus have the potential to present unreasonable risk.
Furthermore, this targeting strategy would eliminate from the requirements new uses where exposure is less likely
and the potential for unreasonable risk may not exist. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Currently, EPA also does not plan to focus on classes of uses where other types of regulatory controls may be more appropriate
than the SNUR approach or where existing controls are sufficient. In many industries, for example, lead compounds
may be used during new or modified manufacturing processes (changes in manufacturing processes can be a factor in
defining a significant new use), possibly resulting in occupational exposures. Similarly, improperly managed
disposal of lead-containing products could result in exposure through releases to groundwater (landfilling) or
the air (incineration). Although EPA is concerned about such exposures, the Agency believes that other regulatory
mechanisms (e.g., Occupational Safety and Health Act, Clean Air Act, and RCRA authorities) are available, and in
some cases in place, to address these problems. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Other uses of lead are exempt from regulation as ``chemical substances'' by EPA under section 3(2)(B) of TSCA. For
example, exposure to lead through contamination of food and water from crystalware, ceramicware, and other housewares
is regulated by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) under authorities granted by the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic
Act and other statutes. The FDA, using its authorities, has established action levels for lead in ceramic foodware,
including flatware, holloware, cups, mugs, and pitchers. The FDA has also issued a public advisory on the storage
of alcoholic beverages in crystalware, provided enforcement guidance for lead in wine, and has proposed a total ban
on the use of tin-coated lead capsules on wine bottles. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
EPA is currently examining five priority classes of use for identification of possible candidates for lead SNURs.
Each class is defined in terms of a distinct exposure and/or environmental release scenario. These classes reflect
the Agency's focus on health risks to children that may result from lead exposure. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The five use classes are: 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
1. Products used in water conveyance systems that come in contact with drinking water. The Agency has substantial
evidence that lead leaches from components of water distribution systems and household plumbing (e.g., fixtures,
fittings, solder, valves, pumps, meters, and tanks). 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
2. Products commonly used in and/or around the home where ordinary use (e.g., manipulation, grinding, sanding, heating)
could result in release of lead to the residential environment. For example, the use of products such as home hobbyist
supplies may contribute lead to household dust; lead vapors from products that are designed to be heated could be inhaled.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
3. Products that could be mouthed by children where the lead-containing component in the product is reasonably accessible
to children. Children could ingest lead by mouthing the lead-containing component (e.g., plastic toys where lead
is used as a pigment or stabilizer and textiles with lead-based dyes). 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
4. Products that can release lead to the environment through exposure to weathering elements during use. Lead could
be released through leaching or through deterioration of the product, contaminating dust and soil (e.g., sheet lead
for roofing, lead caulk, traffic paint). 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
5. Products intended for non-residential (e.g. recreational, transportation, commercial, and industrial) use,
where use necessarily results in uncontrolled release of lead to the environment. Examples include lead-containing
products where use involves: (1) Combustion such as motor fuel additives, resulting in deposition of lead in the environment
and (2) dispersal of the product in the environment such as fishing sinkers and ammunition containing lead shot. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
For each of these five use classes, the following Table 1 provides examples of both the uses and the lead compounds or
elemental forms of lead.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The purpose of Table 1 is to provide further clarification and understanding of these five use classes. Specific uses
included in Table 1 are presented as illustrative examples and are not intended to represent an exhaustive list. Furthermore,
these uses may be existing uses that would not be subject to the SNUR, depending on the final definition of ``significant
new uses.'' 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Given the importance of this targeting scheme in regulating new uses of lead, the Agency is seeking comment on this
approach. Specifically, EPA would like commenters to address the following issues: (1) The appropriateness of using
the targeting approach described above to design lead SNURs, (2) whether the definition of any of the five use classes
is particularly unclear with respect to the types of uses or products that might be covered, (3) whether any use classes
listed in Table 1 should not be included in the targeting strategy and why, and (4) whether any use classes not listed
in Table 1 should be included in the targeting strategy and why. EPA is particularly interested in relevant data that
commenters may possess which suggest that SNURs are or are not appropriate for specific use classes. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Criteria for identifying significant new uses
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
. The second element of EPA's approach for regulating new uses of lead is criteria for defining significant new uses
of lead. These criteria may include the development of a new product/use (i.e., product model or line), change in concentration
of lead in a product/use, change in surface area and other factors that affect the amount of lead released from a product,
and/or change in total volume of lead for a product/use. Because lead is used in a broad range of products involving
numerous industries, it is likely that the Agency will develop criteria that are specific to particular products/uses
rather than one set of criteria that would be applied uniformly. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
When selecting criteria, EPA will endeavor not to define, as significant new uses, products or processes that have
been developed specifically to reduce lead exposures. EPA does not wish and does not intend that any SNUR for lead impede
innovations that would reduce risks to human health and the environment. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
To aid in developing these criteria, EPA plans to establish a baseline inventory of existing uses in the five use classes
identified in Table 1. The baseline inventory will include at least the following data elements for each identified
product/use: Product/use identification, product/use description; lead compound (and CAS number) or form of elemental
lead; median lead concentration; range of lead concentration; other design factors associated with the level of
lead released from the product; the frequency with which the design of the use/product changes; and total volume of
lead consumed annually for the product/use. These data will serve several purposes. First, they will enable EPA to
identify existing uses of lead. Only significant new uses will be subject to regulation under section 5 of TSCA. Second,
these data will improve the Agency's understanding of existing uses and help EPA select appropriate criteria for
effectively identifying and controlling significant new uses of lead. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Agency invites commenters to submit information of the type described in the preceding paragraph for any lead-containing
product/use belonging to one of the five priority use classes identified in Table 1. For purposes of this Notice, EPA
defines a lead-containing use/product as a use/product where lead is intentionally introduced at any stage of manufacturing
or processing. EPA is not currently examining uses/products that contain lead merely as an inadvertent contaminant.
EPA is also interested in data that commenters may possess on human and environmental exposure, bioavailability,
and risks associated with any such products or uses. Although the Agency does not normally consider the costs and/or
availability of substitutes when defining new uses for a SNUR, commenters with this kind of information are welcome
to submit the information if they feel that this information might be useful to the Agency. Data provided by commenters
will help the Agency to compile a baseline inventory of existing lead-containing products and uses and will help in
the selection of criteria for defining significant new uses of lead. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Currently, EPA is not interested in receiving information for uses/products that are not described by any of the five
priority class definitions unless the use/product relates to an additional use class that the commenter believes
EPA should consider when developing a SNUR. Commenters who are uncertain (1) if a specific use/product fits into any
of the five classes and/or (2) about the type of use/product data that EPA would like commenters to submit should address
their questions to the technical contact listed under ``FOR FURTHER INFORMATION CONTACT'' in this document.

As part of an interagency ``streamlining'' initiative, EPA is experimenting with submission of public comments
on selected rulemaking actions electronically through the Internet in addition to accepting comments in traditional
written form. This ANPR is one of the first rulemaking actions selected by EPA for this experiment. From the experiment,
EPA will learn how electronic commenting works, and any problems that arise can be addressed before EPA adopts electronic
commenting more broadly in its rulemaking activities. Electronic commenting through posting to the EPA Bulletin
Board or through the Internet using the ListServe function raise some novel issues that are discussed below in this
Unit. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
To submit electronic comments, persons can either ``subscribe'' to the Internet ListServe application or ``post''
comments to the EPA Bulletin Board. To ``Subscribe'' to the Internet ListServe application for this ANPR, send an
e-mail message to: listserver@unixmail.rtpnc.epa.gov that says ``Subscribe RIN&hyph;2070&hyph;AC37 &lt;first
name> &lt;last name>.'' Once you are subscribed to the ListServe, comments should be sent to: RIN&hyph;2070&hyph;AC37@unixmail.rtpnc.epa.gov.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
For online viewing of submissions and posting of comments, the public access EPA Bulletin Board is also available
by dialing 202&hyph;488&hyph;3671, enter selection ``DMAIL,'' user name ``BB_USER'' or 919&hyph;541&hyph;4642,
enter selection ``MAIL,'' user name ``BB_USER.'' When dialing the EPA Bulletin Board type &lt;Return> at the opening
message. When the ``Notes>'' prompt appears, type ``open RIN&hyph;2070&hyph;AC37'' to access the posted messages
for this document. To get a listing of all files, type ``dir/all'' at the prompt line. Electronic comments can also
be sent directly to EPA at: 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Docket&hyph;OPPTS@epamail.epa.gov.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
To obtain further information on the electronic comment process, or on submitting comments on this ANPR electronically
through the EPA Bulletin Board or the Internet ListServe, please contact John A. Richards (Telephone: 202&hyph;260&hyph;2253;
FAX: 202&hyph;260&hyph;3884; Internet: richards.john@epamail.epa.gov).
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Persons who comment on this ANPR, and those who view comments electronically, should be aware that this experimental
electronic commenting is administered on a completely public system. Therefore, any personal information included
in comments and the electronic mail addresses of those who make comments electronically are automatically available
to anyone else who views the comments. Similarly, since all electronic comments are available to all users, commenters
should not submit electronically any information which they believe to be CBI. Such information should be submitted
only directly to EPA in writing as described in Unit VIII. of this document. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Commenters and others outside EPA may chose to comment on the comments submitted by others using the RIN&hyph;2070&hyph;AC37
ListServe or the EPA Bulletin Board. If they do so, those comments as well will become part of EPA's record for this rulemaking.
Persons outside EPA wishing to discuss comments with commenters or otherwise communicate with commenters but not
have those discussions or communications sent to EPA and included in the EPA rulemaking record should conduct those
discussions and communications outside the RIN&hyph;2070&hyph;AC37 ListServe or the EPA Bulletin Board.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The official record for this rulemaking, as well as the public version, as described above will be kept in paper form.
Accordingly, EPA will transfer all comments received electronically in the RIN&hyph;2070&hyph;AC37 ListServe
or the EPA Bulletin Board, in accordance with the instructions for electronic submission, into printed, paper form
as they are received and will place the paper copies in the official rulemaking record which will also include all comments
submitted directly in writing. All the electronic comments will be available to everyone who obtains access to the
RIN&hyph;2070&hyph;AC37 ListServe or the EPA Bulletin Board; however, the official rulemaking record is the paper
record maintained at the address in ``ADDRESSES'' at the beginning of this document. (Comments submitted only in
written form will not be transferred into electronic form and thus may be accessed only by reviewing them in the TSCA
Nonconfidential Information Center as described above.)
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Because the electronic comment process is still experimental, EPA cannot guarantee that all electronic comments
will be accurately converted to printed, paper form. If EPA becomes aware, in transferring an electronic comment
to printed, paper form, of a problem or error that results in an obviously garbled comment, EPA will attempt to contact
the comment submitter and advise the submitter to resubmit the comment either in electronic or written form. Some
commenters may choose to submit identical comments in both electronic and written form to ensure accuracy. In that
case, EPA requests that commenters clearly note in both the electronic and written submissions that the comments
are duplicated in the other medium. This will assist EPA in processing and filing the comments in the rulemaking record.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
As with ordinary written comments, EPA will not attempt to verify the identities of electronic commenters nor to review
the accuracy of electronic comments. EPA will take such commenters and comments at face value. Electronic and written
comments will be placed in the rulemaking record without any editing or change by EPA except to the extent changes occur
in the process of converting electronic comments to printed, paper form. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
If it chooses to respond officially to electronic comments on this ANPR, EPA will do so either in a notice in the 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 -->
Federal Register
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 or in a response to comments document placed in the rulemaking record for this ANPR. EPA will 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
not
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 respond to commenters electronically other than to seek clarification of electronic comments that may be garbled
in transmission or conversion to printed, paper form as discussed above. Any communications from EPA employees to
electronic commenters, other than those described in this paragraph, either through Internet or otherwise are not
official responses from EPA.

VIII. Confidential Business Information 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
A person may assert a claim of confidentiality for any information, including all or portions of written comments
or data, submitted to EPA in connection with this advanced notice of proposed rulemaking. Information claimed as
confidential should not be submitted electronically as described in Unit VII. of this document. Any person who submits
a comment or data subject to a claim of confidentiality must also submit a nonconfidential version. Any claim of confidentiality
must accompany the information when it is submitted to EPA. Persons must mark information claimed as confidential
by circling, bracketing, or underlining it, and marking it with ``CONFIDENTIAL'' or some other appropriate designation.
EPA will disclose information subject to a claim of confidentiality only to the extent permitted by section 14 of TSCA
and 40 CFR part 2, subpart B. If a person does not assert a claim of confidentiality for information at the time it is submitted
to EPA, EPA may make the information public without further notice to that person. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Any information submitted electronically as described in Unit VII. will be available to the public immediately without
restriction.

IX. Executive Order 12866
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Under Executive Order 12866 (58 FR 51735, October 4, 1993), the Agency must determine whether the regulatory action
is ``significant'' and therefore subject to review by the Office of Management and Budget (OMB) and the requirements
of the Executive Order. Under section 3(f), the order defines a ``significant regulatory action'' as an action that
is likely to result in a rule: (1) Having an annual effect on the economy of $100 million or more, or adversely and materially
affecting a sector of the economy, productivity, competition, jobs, the environment, public health or safety, or
State, local or tribal governments or communities (also referred to as ``economically significant''); (2) creating
serious inconsistency or otherwise interfering with an action taken or planned by another agency; (3) materially
altering the budgetary impacts of entitlement, grants, user fees, or loan programs or the rights and obligations
of recipients thereof; or (4) raising novel legal or policy issues arising out of legal mandates, the President's
priorities, or the principles set forth in this Executive Order. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Pursuant to the terms of this Executive Order, OMB has determined that this ANPR is a ``significant regulatory action''
because a lead SNUR may raise novel legal or policy issues. As such, this action was submitted to OMB for a 10&hyph;day
review, and any comments or changes made in response to OMB suggestions or recommendations have been documented in
the public record.
