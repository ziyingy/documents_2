10. Under the Multi-Class System, all expenses incurred by a Fund will be allocated among the classes of shares of such
Fund based on the net assets of the Fund attributable to each class, except that the net asset value and expenses of each
class will reflect the Distribution Plan expenses (if any) and any expenses attributable to the class as set forth
in condition 1 below (``Class Expenses''). Expenses allocated to a particular class of shares of a Fund will be borne
on a proportionate basis by each outstanding share of that class.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
11. From time to time, a Fund may create additional classes of shares of beneficial interest, the terms of which may
differ from the classes described herein only in the following respects: (a) Each new class of shares might have a different
designation; (b) the impact of the disproportionate payments made under a Distribution Plan; (c) each new class of
shares will hold any voting rights as to matters exclusively affecting that class, except as provided in condition
14 below; (d) each new class of shares will bear Class Expenses specifically attributable to the particular class;
(e) each new class of shares will have different exchange privileges; and (f) certain classes may have a conversion
feature. Applicants also may charge different sales loads on different classes of shares.

12. Applicants will comply with applicable portions of the Rules of Fair Practice of the National Association of Securities
Dealers, Inc. (``NASD''), including in particular the portions of Rule 26 that relate to sales loads, asset-based
sales charges and service fees.

Applicants' Legal Analysis
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
1. Section 18 is designed to prohibit material differences among the rights of shareholders in a fund, including abuses
resulting from complex capital structures (such as excessive leverage, conflicts of interest among classes, and
investor confusion), and discriminatory shareholder voting provisions. Applicants request an exemptive order
to the extent that the proposed Multi-Class System might be deemed to result in a ``senior security'' within the meaning
of section 18(g) of the Act, and thus be prohibited by section 18(f)(1), and violate the equal voting provisions of
the Act.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
2. Applicants assert that the Multi-Class System would present none of the abuses addressed by section 18. No leverage
would result from the issuance or purchase of different classes of shares. Mutuality of risk would be preserved, and
each class of Fund shares would be redeemable at all times. No class of shares of a Fund would have any distribution or
liquidation preference with respect to particular assets, and no class would be protected by any reserve or other
account. Investors would not be given misleading impressions about the safety or risk of any class of shares, because
the similarities and ifferences of the classes of shares would be disclosed in the prospectuses and statements of
additional information describing the Funds.

3. Applicants also request an exemption from the provisions of sections 2(a)(32), 2(a)(35), 22(c), and 22(d) of the
Act, and rule 22c-1 thereunder to the extent necessary to permit the Funds to assess a CDSC on certain redemptions of
shares and to waive the CDSC in certain instances.

1. Each class of shares of a Fund will represent interests in the same portfolio of investments of that Fund and will
be identical in all respects, except as set forth below. The only differences among the classes of shares of the same
Fund will relate solely to: (a) The designation of each class of shares of a Fund; (b) the impact of the disproportionate
payments made under the Distribution Plan; (c) different Class Expenses for each class of shares, which are limited
to: (i) Transfer agency fees identified by the transfer agent of the Funds as being attributable to a specific class;
(ii) blue sky registration fees incurred with respect to a class of shares; (iii) SEC registration fees incurred with
respect to a class of shares; (iv) the expenses of administrative personnel and services as required to provide services
to the shareholders of a specific class; (v) litigation or other legal expenses, or audit or other accounting expenses
relating solely to one class of shares; (vi) directors' fees incurred as a result of issues relating to one class of
shares; and (vii) printing and postage expenses related to preparing and distributing materials such as shareholder
reports, prospectuses, and proxies to current shareholders of a given class; (d) the voting rights as to matters exclusively
affecting one class of shares (

exchange privileges; and (f) certain classes may have a conversion feature. Any additional incremental expenses
not specifically identified above that are subsequently identified and determined to be properly allocated to one
class of shares will not be so allocated unless and until approved by the SEC pursuant to an amended order.
