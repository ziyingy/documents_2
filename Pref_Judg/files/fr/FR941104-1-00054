Saiga tatarica tatarica occurs in two major populations, one in 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Kazakhstan and a second south of the Volga River and northwest of the Caspian 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Sea in the Kalmykian Republic, Russian Federation. By the end of World War I 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
this subspecies was near extinction, but began to recover in the 1920's so 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
that by the late 1950's the population in Kazakhstan was reported to have 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
reached nearly 2,000,000, and in Kalmykia saiga had reportedly increased to 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
about 800,000. In the last two decades these numbers have been reduced again, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
fluctuating around 150,000 in Kalmykia and down to about 450,000 in Kazakhstan 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
in the last few years. These reductions are reportedly the result of a 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
combination of factors including weather, land-use changes, and poaching for 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
horns. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Four comments were received within the comment period. Three comments 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
favored listing saiga antelope in Appendix I, while the fourth supported only 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
an Appendix II listing. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The AHA was in favor of an Appendix I listing ``until trade in the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
species can be shown to be non-detrimental to the survival of the species.'' 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
They stated that researchers indicate that saiga hunting in Russia has been 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
nearly out of control over the last 3&hyph;4 years, implying that this increase is 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
due to poaching for horns. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Defenders supported an Appendix I listing, suggesting that saiga, like 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the rhino, are being threatened by poaching and overhunting for the horn 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
trade, and that saiga horn is the most expensive fever-reducing substance used 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
in traditional medicines after rhino horn. They stated that saiga are also 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
hunted for their meat, fat, and hides. They admitted that status and trade 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
data are extremely limited, but that recent aerial surveys indicated a rapid 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
rate of decline of saiga populations. They also pointed out the dramatic 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
population reductions that can occur among saiga due to extreme weather 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
conditions or food shortages. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The HSUS favored an Appendix I listing for the saiga, also indicating 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the similarity between the use and demand for rhino and saiga horn. From an 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
estimated 2 million animals in the 1960's, 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
S. t. tatarica 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
has plummeted to 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
about 800,000 individuals according to HSUS, due apparently to uncontrolled 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
hunting in Russia and Kazakhstan for the horns. The HSUS noted that the use 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
of saiga horn as a substitute for rhino horn in traditional Chinese medicine 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
has been and is likely to increase as pressures to control the trade in rhino 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
horn intensify. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The World Conservation Union's (IUCN) Sustainable Use of Wildlife 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Programme questioned the long-term benefits to saiga to be derived from an 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Appendix I listing. Such a listing for the Russian subspecies would 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
technically prohibit commercial trade in the species, thus eliminating its 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
value. Local and regional authorities currently would find it nearly 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
impossible to implement the controls necessary to sustain saiga populations in 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the absence of obvious and immediate value to the local economy. They 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
suggested that the local rural population would probably increase livestock 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
numbers in saiga habitat to supplement and replace the value lost from saiga 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
as a result of an Appendix I listing, eventually resulting in extirpation of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the saiga. An Appendix II listing would require the Governments of Russia 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(for the Kalmykia population), Kazakhstan, and Mongolia to implement 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
administrative and management procedures that, if adequate, could be 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
beneficial to the species. The IUCN group was concerned about the demand for 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
saiga horn and possible illegal trade. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Comments received from the Russian Ministry of Protection of the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Environment and Natural Resources described the existence of the two major 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
populations of 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
S. t. tatarica, 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
one in Kalmykia of about 150,000 animals and one in Kazakhstan consisting of ``several tens of thousands.'' Hunting
of saiga has been increasingly reduced since about 1984, with only limited sport-hunting now allowed in Kalmykia,
and protected reserves have been established. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The diminished status of the saiga is due to habitat modifications, changes in 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
land use, and illegal hunting. The Ministry favored a listing of saiga 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
antelope in Appendix II of CITES. Also, by personal communication, the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Chinese Ministry of Forestry indicated that they could support an Appendix II 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
listing.
