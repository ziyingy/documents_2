Private non-profit organizations (NPOs) in communities provide a vital service to the families of missing and exploited
children. These organizations were formed to play a role that is best fulfilled by community members who provide support
to each other during the ordeal many parents and children experience in missing and exploited children cases. Over
the last two years, private non-profit organizations have taken steps to further develop the quality and level services
to include forming a national organization. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
This three year program, to be awarded in two 18 month budget periods, is designed to provide training and technical
assistance that will support the continuing development of NPOs as a resource for providing services in communities
that other agencies may not be best suited to provide. This training and technical assistance would focus on assisting
NPOs in developing protocols that can be used to tailor their mission, goals, and services to the needs of communities.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The project will support up to five demonstration sites that have active missing and exploited children programs
in place and seek to strengthen the role of NPOs in providing services. Technical assistance will also be provided
on a request basis to individual NPO's. The applicant should consider missing and exploited children programs in
local community organizations as possible sites as well. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Products that would be generated as a result of this project would include, but not be limited to, standardized intake
forms, procedures for communication with other agencies, guidelines for establishing a multi-disciplinary board
of directors, and an overall handbook for the operation of an NPO that is tailored to the delivery of services to missing
and exploited children and their families.
