<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Because the statute requires that disability be the result of a medically determinable physical or mental impairment,
the absence of a medically determinable impairment will justify a finding that the individual is not disabled. Under
the new approach, decisionmakers will consider whether an individual has a medically determinable impairment or
combination of impairments, but will no longer impose a threshold ``severity'' requirement. Rather, the threshold
inquiry will be whether the individual has a medically determinable physical or mental impairment or combination
of impairments. To establish the presence of a medically determinable impairment, evidence must show an impairment
that results from anatomical, physiological, or psychological abnormalities which are demonstrable by medically
acceptable clinical and laboratory diagnostic techniques. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Decisionmakers will continue to evaluate the existence of a medically determinable impairment based on a weighing
of all evidence that is collected, recognizing that neither symptoms nor opinions of treating physicians alone will
support a finding that the individual has a medically determinable impairment or combination of impairments. There
must be medical signs and findings established by medically acceptable clinical or laboratory diagnostic techniques
which show the existence of a physical or mental impairment or combination of impairments. Depending on the nature
of an individual's alleged impairment(s), SSA will consider the extent to which medical personnel other than physicians
can provide evidence of a medically determinable impairment. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
There will be an exception to the requirement that evidence include medically acceptable clinical and/or laboratory
diagnostic techniques. This will occur when, even if SSA accepted all of the individual's allegations as true, SSA
still could not establish a period of disability; under these circumstances, SSA will not require evidence to establish
the existence of a medically determinable impairment. For instance, if an individual describes a condition as one
that will clearly not meet the 12-month duration requirement, (e.g., a simple fracture), SSA will deny the claim on
the basis that even if the allegations were medically documented, SSA could not establish a period of disability.

Step 3_Index of Disabling Impairments 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
If an individual has a medically determinable physical or mental impairment documented by medically acceptable
clinical and laboratory techniques, and the impairment will meet the duration requirement, the decisionmaker will
compare the individual's impairment(s) against an index of severely disabling impairments. The index will describe
impairments so severely debilitating that, when documented, can be presumed to equal a loss of functional ability
to perform substantial gainful activity without assessing the individual's functional ability. The index will
be consistent with the statutory definition of disability by limiting the presumption of inability to perform substantial
gainful activity, without considering age, education and previous work, to a relatively small number of claims with
the most severe disabilities. Individual functional ability will be assessed in all other cases in a consistent manner
at Step 4 in the process. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Because the index will permit severely disabling impairments to be identified quickly and easily, it will only consist
of descriptions of specific impairments and the medical findings that are used to substantiate the existence and
severity of the particular disease entity. The medical findings in the index will be as nontechnical as possible and
will exclude such things as calibration or standardization requirements for specific tests and/or detailed test
results (e.g., pulmonary function studies or electrocardiogram tracings). The index will be easy to understand
and simple enough so that laypersons will be able to understand what is required to demonstrate a disabling impairment
in the index. Additionally, SSA will draw no conclusions about the effect of an individual's impairments on his or
her ability to function merely because an individual's impairment(s) does not meet the criteria in the index. Finally,
SSA will no longer need the concept of ``medical equivalence'' in relation to the index. Because impairments included
in the index are presumed to limit functional ability so as to preclude substantial gainful activity without reference
to an individual's age, education and previous work, a combination of impairments, or an impairment closely related
to one that is in the index, would be found disabling when an individual's functional ability is assessed. Therefore,
rules for determining equivalence for impairments in the index will not be necessary.

Step 4_Ability to Engage in Any Substantial Gainful Activity 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The majority of disability claims will be evaluated using a standardized approach to measuring functional ability
to perform substantial gainful activity. This standardized approach will realistically measure an individual's
functional ability to do the principal dimensions of work and task performance. The approach will be known and accepted
in the medical community. It will be universally used by public and private disability programs in which benefits
are based on the ability to perform work-related duties. Standardizing the approach to assessing individual functional
ability will facilitate consistent decisions regardless of the professional training of the decisionmakers in
the disability process. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In using a standardized approach to measuring functional ability, SSA will be assessing the individual's physical
and mental abilities to perform work-related activities. Individualized assessments of functional ability will
also consider the effects of the individual's education. Once the individualized assessment of functional ability
is made, the individual's age will determine whether his or her functional ability is compared against the demands
of the individual's previous work or against a ``baseline'' of occupational demands. The baseline will describe
a range of work-related functions that represent work that exists in significant numbers in the national economy
that does not require prior skills or formal job training.

Standardized Measure of Functional Ability

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
SSA will develop, with the assistance of the medical and advocacy community and other outside experts from public
and private disability programs, standardized instruments or protocols which can be used to measure an individual's
functional ability. These standardized measures of functional ability will be linked to clinical and laboratory
findings to the extent that SSA needs to document the existence of a medically determinable impairment or combination
of impairments. However, extensive development of all available clinical and laboratory findings will not always
be necessary in evaluating an individual's functional ability to perform basic work activities.
