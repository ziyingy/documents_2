SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
 Section 9 of the Act prohibits the ``Taking'' of endangered species, like the black-capped vireo. However, the Service,
under limited circumstances, may issue permits to take endangered wildlife species if such taking is incidental
to, and not the purpose of otherwise lawful activities. Regulations governing permits for endangered species are
at 50 CFR 17.22.

The Applicant plans to build a residential development located west of Austin approximately 2 miles north of the intersection
of Highway 360 and Farm to Market road 2244 in Travis County, Texas. The development will occupy approximately 107.8
acres with 22.5 acres proposed as parkland and 13.9 acres as greenbelt. These activities will permanently eliminate
about 33 acres of occupied and/or suitable black-capped vireo habitat. The Applicant proposes to mitigate the incidental
take by avoiding direct impacts to vireos, preserving undeveloped areas in their natural state, and by creating,
enhancing, and maintaining 100 acres of black-capped vireo habitat offsite. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Applicant considered five alternatives but rejected four of them because they were not economically viable.
