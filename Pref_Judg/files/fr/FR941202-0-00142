The Department received 185 comments on this NPRM. The commenters included 15 transportation employers or their
associations, 9 testing industry organizations, 6 unions, and 155 individual transportation employees. Several
months after the close of the comment period, the Department received additional correspondence on this subject,
but the comments arrived so late in the rulemaking process that it was not practicable to consider them.

Comment was divided on the basic issue of whether blood testing should be authorized. Employee comments were uniformly
against the proposal. Six unions representing transportation workers and 155 individual transportation employees
opposed blood testing. They cited a number of reasons. Blood testing was too invasive, causing pain and fear in many
employees and severely invading employees' privacy. There was no possibility of immediate confirmation. There
would be too much employer discretion as to when blood could be used, which could lead to abuse (e.g., overuse of blood
by employers). Some of these comments expressed concern about incompetent or dangerous collection practices. Two
additional commenters (one of whom favored using blood testing) expressed concern about confrontations arising
from employees who objected to giving blood.

Twenty-five commenters, most of them employers or employer associations, favored blood testing. Thirteen of these
endorsed the NPRM proposal. Most did so on the basis that it would be less costly and more convenient to be able to use
blood testing for reasonable suspicion and post-accident testing. Specifically, commenters were concerned that,
in the absence of a blood option for these types of testing, employers would have to buy an unreasonably large number
of EBTs to cover all their work locations. The other 12 commenters in this group favored much wider discretion for employers,
saying that blood testing should be available for confirmation in all types of testing, with non-evidential devices
(such as saliva devices) available for screening tests. The result would be that EBTs need never be obtained or used.
Employers in the pipeline industry were particularly in favor of this approach, noting that only reasonable suspicion
and post-accident alcohol tests are required for their industry, which has employees at many remote sites.

A related issue was how to define ``readily available.'' The NPRM proposed that blood could be used when breath testing
was not ``readily available,'' and asked for comment on what that term should mean. Five commenters believed that
a specific number of hours (e.g., two or eight) should be used as the criterion. That is, if breath testing could not
be performed within that number of hours after the event leading to the test, then blood could be used. Nine commenters,
to the contrary, said that employers should be able to decide when breath testing was readily available, based on such
factors as cost, convenience, or preference. (One comment, on the other hand, said employers should never have this
discretion.) The latter view was advocated by several of the commenters who favored a broader use of blood testing
than the NPRM proposed, as it would reduce the number of occasions on which breath testing would be needed and perhaps
make it possible for some employers to avoid breath testing altogether. Two commenters, representing aviation management
and labor, respectively, disagreed about whether EBTs would typically be available in airports. Two other commenters
proposed more complex schemes for determining when blood testing could be used.

On the question of what laboratories should be used for blood testing, six comments favored using state-certified
laboratories, when they were available. Some of them said that these laboratories should be viewed as adequate at
least until Department of Health and Human Services (DHHS) -certified laboratories became available. Ten comments
favored DHHS certification for blood testing laboratories, though these commenters differed among themselves
about whether DHHS-certified laboratories should be the only laboratories permitted to test blood in DOT-mandated
tests. Two other comments favored using laboratories certified by the College of American Pathologists (CAP), and
three others supported using whatever laboratories were available, whether certified by DHHS, states, or CAP.

Eleven commenters thought DOT should develop uniform, national testing procedures. Some of these commenters argued
that state procedures are unreliable or that it would be too confusing to apply a variety of state standards, particularly
for employers who operate in more than one state. Two testing industry organizations suggested using an existing
industry blood collection standard. Eight other commenters thought that state procedures, or procedures developed
at the discretion of the employer, should be viewed as adequate.

Nine commenters thought employers should either be authorized or required to ``stand down'' employees based on a
positive screening test, pending receipt of the results of the blood confirmation test from the laboratory. Eight
comments favored allowing an employee's supervisor to act as the collector for the screening test, the confirmation
test, or both, at least if other trained collectors were not available. One comment opposed ever allowing a supervisor
to act as a collector. With respect to fatal flaws, nine commenters agreed (and two disagreed) that a sample collected
by an unauthorized collector should be regarded as invalid, eight said it should not be a fatal flaw if the procedures
of the wrong state were used for collection. There were also several comments concerning the details of blood testing
kits.
