 Subject to the provisions of &sect;3001.30(f), limited participators may present evidence which is relevant to
the issues involved in the proceeding and their testimony shall be subject to cross-examination on the same terms
applicable to that of formal participants. Limited participants may file briefs or proposed findings pursuant to
&sect;&sect;3001.34 and 3001.35, and within 15 days after the release of an intermediate decision, or such other
time as may be fixed by the Commission, they may file a written statement of their position on the issues. The Commission
or the presiding officer may require limited participators having substantially like interests and positions to
join together for any or all of the above purposes. Limited participators are not required to respond to discovery
requests under &sect;3001.25 through &sect;3001.28 except to the extent that those requests are directed specifically
to testimony which the limited participators provided in the proceeding; however, limited participators, particularly
those making contentions under 39 U.S.C. 3622(b)(4), are advised that failure to provide relevant and material information
in support of their claims will be taken into account in determining the weight to be placed on their evidence and arguments.
