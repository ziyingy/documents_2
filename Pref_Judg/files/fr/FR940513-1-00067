c. Pollution that cannot be prevented or recycled 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
should be treated in an environmentally safe manner wherever 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
feasible; and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
d. Disposal or other release into the environment 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
should be employed only as a last resort and should be 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
conducted in an environmentally safe manner. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Pollution prevention means ``source reduction,'' as 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
defined under the Pollution Prevention Act, and other 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
practices that reduce or eliminate the creation of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
pollutants. Source reduction is any practice that reduces 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the amount of any hazardous substance entering the waste 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
stream or otherwise released into the environment prior to 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
recycling, treatment, or disposal. Source reduction does 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
not include any practice which alters the physical, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
chemical, or biological characteristics or the volume of a 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
hazardous substance, pollutant, or contaminant through a 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
process or activity which itself is not integral to and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
necessary for the production of a product or the providing 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
of a service. Under the Pollution Prevention Act, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
recycling, energy recovery, treatment and disposal are not 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
included within the definition of pollution prevention. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Some practices commonly described as ``in-process recycling'' 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
may qualify as pollution prevention. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Pollution prevention principles have been incorporated 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
into the proposed marine vessel standards. The proposed 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
prohibition of emissions from ballasting and steam stripping 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
operations has the effect of preventing pollution from 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
occurring at the source. Alternative processes 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(i.e., segregated ballast tanks and vacuum regeneration) are 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
readily available, widely used, and have the benefit of not 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
resulting in HAP or VOC emissions. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Although not considered pollution prevention, vapor 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
recovery and recycling is a common practice in this 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
industry, particularly gasoline recovery (the lower vapor 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
pressure crude oils are less conducive to recovery and are 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
more likely to foul the carbon bed). The proposed standards 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
encourage vapor recovery by allowing the use of well- 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
operated and maintained recovery devices that operate at 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
95-percent emission reduction. Recovery devices are 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
desirable compared to combustion devices because the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
recovered compounds can be reused in other processes, which 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
reduces the quantity of virgin materials that must be 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
produced. Recovery devices also tend to generate fewer 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
secondary pollution impacts than do combustion devices.

D. Emission Points To Be Regulated 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The emission points to be regulated include all means 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
of venting the tank during loading of product or ballast. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
These include, but are not limited to, open hatches and/or 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
overhead vent systems. The proposed rulemakings will not 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
directly regulate seals, hatches, or covers associated with 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the marine tank vessel. However, these items must be in 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
satisfactory condition for the vessel to pass one of the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
three different marine tank vessel tightness tests, and must 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
remain closed during the loading process.
