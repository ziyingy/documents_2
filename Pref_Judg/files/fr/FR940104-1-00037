None of NHTSA's safety standards currently mandates the installation of antilock braking systems (ABS) on light
vehicles or specifies performance requirements intended to ensure the proper functioning of an ABS voluntarily
installed on a light vehicle. A light vehicle equipped with an ABS is required to meet the same stopping distance requirements
as a non-ABS-equipped light vehicle. In addition, a light vehicle with a failed ABS must be capable of meeting the stopping
distance requirements for partial failure of the service brake system, as follows: passenger cars are required to
stop within 456 feet and other light vehicles must stop within 517 feet when traveling at 60 mph on a high coefficient
of friction surface. (See section S5.5 of Standard No. 105).
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
NHTSA has proposed requirements for functioning and failed ABSs. NHTSA is currently reviewing comments to a supplemental
notice of proposed rulemaking (SNPRM) that proposes to establish a new standard, Standard No. 135,

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
, which would replace Standard No. 105 as it applies to passenger cars. (56 FR 30528, July 3, 1991). The rulemaking to
establish the new standard resulted from NHTSA's efforts to harmonize its safety standards with international standards.
The agency anticipates the next regulatory action related to Standard No. 135 will be issued in early 1994.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In the SNPRM, NHTSA proposed requirements for functioning antilock systems, which include straight line stops on
high and low coefficient of friction surfaces, a high coefficient of friction to low coefficient of friction surface
transition test, and a low coefficient of friction to high coefficient of friction surface transition test. A high
coefficient of friction surface, such as dry asphalt, is one that is relatively sticky and thus provides higher levels
of braking force and better lateral stability and control during braking. Conversely, a low coefficient of friction
surface, such as wet or icy pavement, is one that is relatively slippery and thus provides lower levels of braking force
and poorer lateral stability and control during braking. These surfaces are referred to as high mu and low mu surfaces,
respectively.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The agency also proposed requirements for failed antilock systems, which are more stringent than Standard No. 105's
antilock failure requirements. For an antilock functional failure, the agency proposed a stopping distance of 85
meters (279 feet) from 100 kilometers per hour (62 mph).

B. Statutory Mandate

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Sections 2500 through 2509 of the ``Intermodal Surface Transportation Efficiency Act of 1991'' are called the ``National
Highway Traffice Safety Administration Authorization Act of 1991'' (``Authorization Act''). Among other things,
the Authorization Act directs NHTSA to initiate rulemaking on a number of safety matters, including brake performance
standards for passenger cars.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Today's ANPRM initiates the rulemaking required by section 2507 of the Authorization Act. That section provides
that, not later than December 31, 1993, an advance notice of proposed rulemaking be published, in accordance with
the National Traffic and Motor Vehicle Safety Act of 1966, to consider the need for any additional brake performance
standards for passenger cars, including ABS standards. The Act also directs the agency to ``consider any such [antilock
brake system] adopted by a manufacturer'' to facilitate and encourage innovation and early application of economical
and effective antilock brake systems for all such vehicles.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Section 2507 requires the rulemaking action to be completed not later than 36 months from issuance of the ANPRM. Under
sections 2507 and 2052(b)(2)(B)(ii), the action will be considered completed when the agency either promulgates
a final rule or decides not to promulgate a rule.

C. Antilock Brake Systems
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The primary benefit of an ABS is its ability to prevent loss-of-control accidents caused by wheel lockup during braking.
This allows the driver to maintain steering control and lateral stability even in panic braking situations. In addition,
vehicles equipped with an ABS typically have enhanced braking efficiency and as a consequence usually have shorter
stopping distances, particularly on low mu surfaces, compared to the same vehicle without an ABS.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
ABSs help prevent braking induced loss-of-control situations by automatically controlling the amount of braking
pressure applied to a wheel. Current antilock braking systems include wheel speed sensors that measure wheel speeds
and transmit signals to an Electronic Control Unit (ECU). The ECU monitors wheel speeds, and changes in wheel speeds,
based on electrical signals transmitted from sensors located at the wheels or within the axle housings. If the wheels
start to lock, the ECU signals a modulator control valve to actuate, thereby holding constant or reducing the amount
of braking pressure applied to the wheel or axle that is nearing lockup. This continuous feedback cycle of sensing,
controlling, modulating, and sensing prevents wheel lockup, and results in improved vehicle stability and steering
control during braking on all types of road surface conditions.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
There are two primary types of ABS configurations that are currently available for most light vehicles: all-wheel
systems and rear-wheel-only systems. An all-wheel ABS directly controls all the wheels on the vehicle, typically
by using individual wheel control for the front axle wheels and either individual wheel control or select low control
for the rear axle wheels. (Select low control provides the same brake pressure modulation to both wheels of an axle
whenever either wheel on that axle approaches lockup.) A vehicle equipped with an all-wheel ABS is able to maintain
steering control, even during hard braking on wet surfaces. Because maintaining steering control can be a key factor
in accident avoidance, a vehicle equipped with an all-wheel ABS would be expected to experience better lateral stability
and control during hard braking, particularly on wet or slippery road surface conditions.
