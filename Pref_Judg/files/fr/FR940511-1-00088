Based on the structure activity relationship, the health-based level for a one-in-a-million risk level for TBP should
be the same as that for 2,4,6-trichlorophenol (

, 0.003 mg/L assuming exposure of drinking 2.0 liters per day for a 70-year exposure period). The health-based level
of 0.003 mg/L can be considered a bounding estimate which could overestimate the exposure in an actual population.
TCLP leaching data presented in the Industry Study Background Document show concentrations of 760 and 16 mg/L of TBP
in leachate extracts from the off-specification product and the filter cartridges, respectively.

Since the leachate levels exceed the health-based levels for this wastestream, the Agency conducted an analysis
of the potential risk from unlined landfill disposal. For this analysis, the Agency selected what are perhaps conservative
dilution factors and exposure assumptions. Using a dilution and attenuation factor of 100 from the Toxicity Characteristic
rule (55 FR 11798, March 29, 1990) to simulate the subsurface dilution of the leachate concentration between an unlined
landfill and a hypothetical receptor well, the estimated TBP concentrations in groundwater are 7.6 and 0.16 mg/L,
respectively. Assuming that people drinking from this hypothetical well are exposed to the contaminant by drinking
1.4 L/day of contaminated water every day over a 30-year interval, the health-based limit of a one-in-a-million increased
lifetime risk of cancer is 0.01 mg/L. Thus, the levels of estimated individual risk from exposure to TBP in groundwater
are 7&times;10

For this proposed rule, the Agency did not conduct a more sophisticated risk analysis. A more sophisticated risk assessment
may suggest different estimated risks than the analysis described above. For example, the dilution factor of 100
was derived assuming that the chemical does not adsorb or degrade in the subsurface environment. The Agency is aware
that the fate and transport of TBP in the environment is dependent on the environment in which the waste is disposed.
If disposal is to a neutral or slightly acidic environment, the octanol-water coefficient (a constant often related
to the soil-water adsorption coefficient) for TBP is relatively high, exceeding 16,000. This value suggests that
TBP in landfill leachate may bind to subsurface soils and may migrate at low concentrations over a very long period
of time in some environments. On the other hand, disposal under alkaline conditions, which are present in areas where
organobromines are produced, would likely result in less sorption to subsurface soils. This suggests that TBP could
become more mobile under these conditions. In addition, the dilution factor of 100 in the analysis used corresponds
to the dilution factor expected at a drinking water well 500 feet downgradient from the disposal location. The Agency
does not know the distance between landfills or disposal areas that could receive TBP wastes and the nearby downgradient
drinking water wells or intercept surface waters. Depending on the distance to the nearest well or environmental
receptor, the actual human health and environmental risks could be substantially greater than or less than those
estimated in the analysis employed in this proposal.

A more sophisticated analysis would also consider other potential exposure pathways in addition to consumption
of contaminated groundwater. For example, since TBP under some soil pH's is likely to bind strongly to particulates
such as soil, the Agency is concerned that disposal of these wastes could result in soil contamination around the disposal
site and human health and environmental risks. The concentration of 2,4,6 TBP in the floor sweepings was very high
(up to 400,000 ppm) in the two samples the Agency measured. Since the wastes are in dry, powdery form, they could be dispersed
around the disposal facility. Depending on the disposal rate and the likelihood of exposure, exposure to particulates
at the disposal site could pose human health and environmental risks at levels of concern.

The Agency requests comment on the risk analysis used in this proposal and plausible mismanagement practices of TBP
wastes. EPA requests comment on the issues raised above and on all aspects of the risk analysis employed. In particular,
the Agency requests comment on the use of the DAF of 100 for this specific analysis.

Disposal in a Subtitle D landfill is the most plausible mismanagement scenario, given the lower cost for disposal
at such sites. The model previously discussed assumes that the Subtitle D facility is unlined. Because the concentrations
of TBP at a receptor well could exceed health-based levels, the Agency is proposing to list the solids from the production
of tribromophenol as hazardous wastes.

The Agency is seeking comment on the risk levels used in this risk assessment. In the Superfund program, EPA makes clean
up decisions using concentration levels that represent excess upper bound lifetime cancer risk to an individual
of between 10
