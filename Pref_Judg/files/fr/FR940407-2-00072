 grant award under this announcement. The Administration for Native Americans will accept only one application from

E. Multi-Year Projects 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
This announcement is soliciting applications for project periods up to three years. Awards on a competitive basis,
will be for a one-year budget period, although project periods may be for up to three years. Applications for continuation
grants funded under these awards beyond the one-year budget period, but within the three year project period, will
be entertained in subsequent years on a non-competitive basis subject to availability of funds, satisfactory progress
of the grantee and determination that continued funding would be in the best interest of the government. A multi-year
project 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
cannot
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 be a series of unrelated objectives with activities presented in chronological order over a two or three period. Timely
submission of objective progress reports on work under a grant is essential to continued funding of that grant. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Applicants may apply for projects of up to 36 months duration. A multi-year project is a project on a single theme that
requires more than 12 months to complete and affords the applicant an opportunity to develop and address more complex
and in-depth strategies than can be completed in one year. Applicants are encouraged to develop multi-year projects.
A multi-year project 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
cannot
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 be a series of unrelated objectives with activities presented in chronological order over a two or three year period.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The budget period for each multi-year project grant is 12 months. The non-competitive funding for the second and third
years is contingent upon the grantee's satisfactory progress in achieving the objectives of the project, according
to the approved Objective Work Plan (OWP), the availability of Federal funds, and compliance with the applicable
statutory, regulatory and grant requirements, including timely submission of objective progress reports (OPRs).

F. Grantee Share of Project 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Grantees must provide at least 20 percent of the total approved cost of the project. The total approved cost of the project
is the sum of the Federal share and the non-Federal share. The non-Federal share may be met by cash or through the provision
of in-kind property or services, but only to the extent that cash or property is from any source (including any Federal
agency) other than a program, contract or grant authorized under the Native American Programs Act of 1974, as amended.
Therefore, a project requesting $300,000 in Federal funds (based on an award of $100,000 per budget period for three
years), must include a match of at least $75,000 (20% of the total project costs). An itemized budget detailing the
applicant's non-Federal share, and its source, must be included in an application. A request for a waiver of the non-Federal
share requirement may be submitted in accordance with 45 CFR 1336.50(b)(3) of the Native American Program Regulations.
