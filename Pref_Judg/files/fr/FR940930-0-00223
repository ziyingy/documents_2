Final Rule

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Paragraph (a) of this section requires that when any essential component of a highway-rail grade crossing warning
system fails to perform its intended function, the cause shall be determined and the faulty component shall be adjusted,
repaired, or replaced without undue delay. Paragraph (b) requires until repair of an essential component is completed,
a railroad shall take appropriate action under &sect;234.105 or &sect;234.107.

Section 234.209&blank;Interference With Normal Functioning of System
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The proposed rule requires that the normal functioning of any system shall not be interfered with in testing or otherwise
without first taking measures to provide for safety of highway traffic that depends on normal functioning of such
system.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
FRA requested that interested parties discuss the safety effect on warning systems caused by railroad equipment
standing or being switched within the system's approach circuit where the warning system is not designed to accommodate
those activities. FRA stated, ``[t]here have been instances of such cars and locomotives activating the warning
system for an extended length of time when there is no danger in crossing the tracks, raising the issue of credibility
at that crossing. If there are multiple tracks at the crossing, a warning system activated for a period of time due to
standing equipment may effectively entice a highway user to cross the tracks, when in fact a train may be approaching
on the other track. This situation may be exacerbated by reduced visibility of the approaching train due to the standing
equipment.''
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The ATA suggested that the rule be revised to prohibit railroad equipment from being left standing or switched at a
crossing in a manner that interferes with the normal functioning of the warning system. Maine DOT noted that warning
system activations due to switching activity and standing equipment within crossing circuitry can be alleviated
by installation of motion sensing devices. The labor/management group concurred in the rule as proposed and noted
that most railroads have established procedures to be followed when testing or other work is performed near grade
crossings. The group also notes that it would be ``inappropriate'' to allow excessive or continuous operation of
warning devices while such work is being performed. In response to FRA's question regarding the effect of switching
operations and equipment standing near crossings, the group recognized that the issues presented are important
but believe a ``separate examination of the engineering and operating issues involved'' to be more appropriate to
determine if agency action is warranted. The group stated that ``as FRA is aware, railroads cannot operate without
conducting switching operations in the approaches of highway-rail crossings. This is a normal part of railroad operations
and there is no available technology which would completely eliminate the warning system activations which result
from these operations.''
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
FRA recognizes that normal switching operations will activate warning systems in many locations. We agree that there
is no realistic means to prevent this from occurring at all locations. However, standing equipment which is not involved
in switching activities can be prevented from activating warning systems. A warning system can be designed to accommodate
trains, locomotives or other railroad equipment standing within the system's approach circuit. Motion detectors,
time-out circuits, and similar technology can accommodate a railroad's operational needs while retaining a credible,
functioning warning system at a nearby crossing. If such technology is not in place, a railroad must take measures
to prevent activation of the nearby warning system. Many railroads presently have operating rules prohibiting just
such a result. Rule 103(D) of the General Code of Operating Rules provides that ``automatic crossing signals must
not be actuated unnecessarily by open switch or permitting equipment to stand within the controlling circuit.''
Similarly, NORAC Rule 138(b) provides that to ``*&blank;*&blank;* avoid unnecessary operation of automatic highway
crossing protection *&blank;*&blank;* [E]ngines or cars must not be allowed to stand longer than necessary.''
