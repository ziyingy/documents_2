 a year earlier. Of the 32.8 thousand metric tons used in final products in 1992, 31.6 thousand metric tons were imported,
at a value of $7.2 million dollars (not shown in table). World production in 1992 was an estimated 3.1 million metric
tons [Bureau of Mines, 1993, Table 1].

According to the Bureau of Mines, 1991 apparent consumption of asbestos in the United States was 34,765 metric tons
[Bureau of Mines, 1993, Table 1]. Total consumption shown in Table 1, taken from another Bureau of Mines table, differs
from the first estimate by roughly 800 metric tons. The difference may be partly accounted for by the exclusion of the
``Other'' category from the 1991 total in Table 1.

In July 1989, the Environmental Protection Agency issued a final rule under section 6 of the Toxic Substances Control
Act to prohibit the future manufacture, importation, processing, and distribution of asbestos in almost all products.
The Asbestos Ban and Phaseout Rule (40 CFR 763.160) was scheduled to eliminate asbestos in most commercial products
in three stages over seven years beginning in 1990 and ending in 1996. EPA's asbestos rule was challenged in U.S. court
by the asbestos industry. In October 1991, the U.S. Fifth Circuit Court of Appeals vacated and remanded most of the
ban and phaseout rule to EPA. As a result of the Court decision, most asbestos products are no longer subject to the ban
and phaseout rule. The Court chose to let stand EPA's authority to ban products that no longer are being produced in
or imported into the United States.

Consumption of asbestos products in the United States has declined in recent years due to technological, regulatory
and economic factors. U.S. manufacturers have modified product design to either (1) accommodate the use of asbestos
substitutes or (2) eliminate the need for fibrous materials altogether. Examples of asbestos substitutes include
aramid fiber, carbon fiber, cellulose fiber, ceramic fiber, fibrous glass, organic fiber, steel fibers, and wollastonite.
The following products have been successfully introduced as alternatives to asbestos: aluminum, vinyl and wood
siding; aluminum and fiberglass sheet; asphalt coatings; ductile iron pipe; polyvinylchloride pipe; prestressed
and reinforced concrete pipe; and semimetallic brakes. Although the introduction of asbestos substitutes and alternatives
enables manufacturers to avoid contact with asbestos, many of these surrogates pose occupational health hazards
of varying degrees.

Despite the decline in U.S. consumption of asbestos, foreign markets continue to demand U.S. asbestos products.
The export and re-export of asbestos fibers and asbestos products from the United States was valued at $140.8 million
in 1992, an increase of 14 percent from the 1991 level. Leading importers of American asbestos materials were Canada,
Japan, Mexico, the United Kingdom, and Germany. At the same time, three members of the European Community_Germany,
the Netherlands, and Italy_are taking legislative steps to ban the use of asbestos. Effective dates for the ban initiatives
ranged from July 1993 to 1995. In addition, Finland and Poland are phasing out the importation and use of asbestos [Canadian
Mineral Yearbook, 1993, p. 10.4].

Asbestos Exposure in General Industry 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
OSHA has determined that the following general industry groups will be affected by the revision to the asbestos standard:
primary manufacture of asbestos friction materials (SIC 3292); primary manufacture of asbestos gaskets and packings
(SIC 3053); primary manufacture of asbestos adhesives, sealants, and coatings (SIC 2952); primary manufacture
of asbestos-reinforced plastics (SIC 3089); general automotive repair (SICs 551, 554 and 753) and shipbuilding
and repair (SIC 3731). 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In addition, secondary gaskets and packings and secondary auto remanufacturing fall under the scope of the revised
standard. However, few impacts, if any, are anticipated for these industry groups due to their low current exposure
levels (below the revised PEL of 0.1 f/cc).

Primary Manufacturing.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 Primary manufacturers use asbestos fiber as a raw material in the production of an intermediate product to be further
processed or fabricated into a finished product. As shown in Table 2, two processes_fiber introduction and product
finishing/dry mechanical_are common to all primary manufacturing operations and, according to risk profiles in
earlier reports [RTI, 1985; ICF, 1988], have a high potential for generating airborne asbestos fiber.
