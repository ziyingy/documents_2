The requested season dates and bag limits are similar to the regulations of the past five years and it is anticipated
there will be no significant changes in harvest levels. Data from check stations indicate the estimated 1993&hyph;94
duck harvest to be 309 and the goose harvest to be 120. A large majority of the harvest is by non-tribal hunters.

The Service proposes to approve the tribes' request for special migratory bird regulations for the 1994&hyph;95
hunting season.

Almost all of the Fort Hall Indian Reservation is tribally-owned. The tribes claim full wildlife management authority
throughout the reservation, but the Idaho Fish and Game Department has disputed tribal jurisdiction, especially
for hunting by nontribal members on reservation lands owned by non-Indians. As a compromise, since 1985, the Service
has established the same waterfowl hunting regulations on the reservation and in a surrounding off-reservation
State zone. The regulations were requested by the tribes and provided for different season dates than in the remainder
of the State. The Service agreed to the season dates because it seemed likely that they would provide additional protection
to mallards and pintails; the State concurred with the zoning arrangement. The Service has no objection to the State's
use of this zone again in the 1994&hyph;95 hunting season, provided the duck and goose hunting season dates are the
same as on the reservation. In a May 11, 1994, proposal, for the 1994&hyph;95 hunting season, the Shoshone-Bannock
Tribes have requested a continuous duck (including mergansers) season with the maximum number of days and the same
daily bag and possession limits permitted Pacific Flyway States, under final Federal frameworks to be announced.
If 59 days are permitted, as in last year, this could conceivably begin the season on October 22 and conclude it on December
20, 1994, with a later opening and a later closure. Coot and snipe season dates would be the same as for ducks, with the
same daily bag and possession limits permitted Pacific Flyway States. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The tribes also requested a continuous goose season with the maximum number of days and the same daily bag and possession
limits permitted Idaho under Federal frameworks. The tribes propose that, if the same number of hunting days (93)
are permitted as in previous years, the season would have a later opening (October 8, 1994) and a later closing date
(January 8, 1995) than last year. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Non-tribal hunters must comply with all basic Federal migratory bird hunting regulations in 50 CFR Part 20, regarding
shooting hours and manner of taking. Special regulations established by the Shoshone-Bannock Tribes also apply
on the reservation. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Service notes that the requested regulations are nearly identical to those of last year and proposes to approve
them.
