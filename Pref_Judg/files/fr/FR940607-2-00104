(d) For obligations subject to unconditional, irrevocable credit enhancement (including, without limitation,
a guarantee, letter of credit, or put), the Funds may rely upon the NRSRO ratings of the provider of such credit enhancement
to determine whether the obligation satisfies the requirements of subparagraphs (a) and (b) above. Such obligations
shall be treated as rated securities to the extent that the credit enhancement is of comparable priority and security
to the rated obligations of the provider of such credit enhancement.

 2. No Fund will engage in transactions with an Affiliated Bank that exercises a controlling influence over that Fund
(and ``controlling influence'' shall be deemed to include, but is not limited to, directly or indirectly, owning,
controlling or holding more than 25% of the outstanding voting securities of the Fund). Further, no Fund will engage
in a transaction in Qualified Securities with an Affiliated Bank that is an investment adviser or sponsor to that Fund,
or an Affiliated Bank controlling, controlled by, or under common control with such investment adviser or sponsor.
No Fund will purchase obligations of any Affiliated Bank (other than repurchase agreements) if, as a result, more
than 5% of that Fund's total assets would be invested in obligations of that Affiliated Bank.

 3. Each Fund: (a) Will maintain and preserve permanently in an easily accessible place a written copy of the procedures
(and any modifications thereto) described in condition 8; and (b) will maintain and preserve for a period of not less
than six years from the end of the fiscal year in which any transactions occurred, the first two years in an easily accessible
place, a written record of each such transaction setting forth a description of the security purchased or sold, the
identity of the person on the other side of the transaction, the terms of the purchase or sale transaction, and the information
or material upon which the determinations described below were made.

 4. The security to be purchased or sold by a Fund will be consistent with the investment objectives and policies of that
Fund as recited in the registration statement relating to the Fund, and will be consistent with the interests of the
Fund and its shareholders. Further, the security to be purchased or sold by that Fund must be comparable in terms of
quality, yield, and maturity to other similar securities that are appropriate for the Fund and that are being purchased
or sold during a comparable period of time. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
 5. The terms of the transactions will be reasonable and fair to the shareholders of a Fund and will not involve overreaching
of the Fund or its shareholders on the part of any person concerned. In considering whether the price to be paid or received
for the security is reasonable and fair, the price of the security will be analyzed with respect to comparable transactions
involving similar securities being purchased or sold during a comparable period of time. In making this analysis,
the board of directors/trustees may rely on a matrix pricing system which they believe properly assists them in determining
the value of the securities pursuant to section 2(a)(41)(ii) of the Act.

 6. Before any transaction in U.S. government securities may be conducted pursuant to the exemption, the Fund involved
or its investment adviser must obtain such information as they deem necessary to determine that the price to be paid
or received for the security is at least as favorable as that from other sources. The Fund or its investment adviser
must obtain and document competitive quotations from at least two other dealers with respect to the specific proposed
U.S. government securities transaction, except that if quotations are unavailable from two such dealers, only one
other competitive quotation is required. With respect to prospective purchases of U.S. government securities,
these dealers must be those who have securities of the categories and the type desired in their inventories and who
are in a position to quote favorable prices with respect thereto. With respect to the prospective disposition of U.S.
government securities, these dealers must be those who, in the experience of the Fund and its investment adviser,
are in a position to quote favorable prices.

 7. The commission, fee spread, or other remuneration to be received by the Affiliated Bank as dealer will be reasonable
and fair compared to the commission, fee, spread, or other remuneration received by other brokers or dealers in connection
with comparable transactions involving similar securities being purchased or sold during a comparable period of
time but in no event will such fee, commission, spread or other remuneration exceed that which is stated in section
17(e)(2) of the Act. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
 8. The board of directors/trustees of each of the Funds: (a) Will adopt procedures, pursuant to which transactions
may be effected for the Funds, which are reasonably designed to provide that the conditions in the foregoing paragraphs
and the requirements of Investment Company Act Release No. 13005 (Feb. 2, 1983) have been compiled with; (b) will make
and approve such changes as deemed necessary; and (c) will determine no less frequently than quarterly that such transactions
made during the preceding quarter were effected in compliance with such procedures. These procedures will also be
approved by a majority of the non-interested members of each board of directors/trustees. The investment adviser
to each Fund will implement these procedures and make decisions necessary to meet these conditions, subject to the
direction and control of the board of directors/trustees of the relevant Fund.
