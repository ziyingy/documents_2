Third, for existing wholesale requirements contracts that do not address stranded costs through exit fee or other
explicit stranded cost provisions, the proposed rule would allow a public utility to seek recovery of stranded costs
only if: (1) The existing contract contains a specific provision allowing recovery of stranded costs; or (2) the parties
to the existing contract renegotiate the contract in accordance with this rule and file an amendment dealing with
stranded costs prior to the expiration of the three-year transition period; or (3) if the parties to the existing contract
do not renegotiate a stranded cost amendment, the selling utility unilaterally files, no later than the end of the
transition period, a proposed stranded cost amendment to the parties' existing contract; or (4) if the parties to
the existing contract do not renegotiate an amendment, the public utility files a request to recover stranded costs
in its transmission rates under FPA sections 205&hyph;206, or 211&hyph;212, under the limited circumstance described
in section III.C.(3) herein. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Fourth, if the selling utility under an existing wholesale requirements contract is a transmitting utility but not
also a public utility, and the contract does not address stranded costs through an explicit exit fee or other stranded
cost provision, the transmitting utility may file a request to recover stranded costs in transmission rates under
FPA sections 211&hyph;212, as described in section III.C.(3) herein.

 and subsequent cases, the Commission provided guidance concerning the evidentiary demonstration that utilities
must make to recover stranded costs in wholesale transmission rates. The Commission believes that this demonstration
is still relevant and appropriate. We therefore propose to apply it to any proposal for extra-contractual recovery
in accordance with this proposed rule.

This would include public utilities who unilaterally seek to amend an existing wholesale requirements contract
as described herein and public utilities and transmitting utilities that seek to recover stranded costs through
transmission rates. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
</FOOTNOTE>

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The following is the proposed demonstration that a public utility or transmitting utility must satisfy in order to
recover stranded costs in wholesale transmission rates, and that a public utility must satisfy if it proposes a unilateral
amendment to its wholesale requirements contract: 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(1) A utility must show that it incurred stranded costs based on an expectation that was reasonable when the costs were
incurred that the applicable contract would be extended; 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(2) A utility must show that the stranded costs it incurred are not more than the customer would have contributed to
the utility had the customer remained a wholesale requirements customer of the utility; 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(3) A utility must show that it has taken and will take reasonable and prudent measures to mitigate stranded costs.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The question of whether a utility had a reasonable expectation of continuing to serve a customer is a factual matter
that will depend on the evidence produced in each case. Whether the utility's expectation was reasonable will depend
on the circumstances at the time that stranded costs were incurred, including, for instance, whether the customer
at that time had access to alternative suppliers. A utility also must offer evidence that its expectation was based
on the actual conduct or course of dealing of the two parties (the utility and its customer). However, the Commission
does not believe it is in the public interest to have prolonged litigation on these issues. Therefore, we will provide
general guidance as to the type of evidence that would tend to prove or disprove the existence of a reasonable expectation.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
When a public utility seeks to include certain types of construction-work-in-progress (CWIP) in rate base for a particular
customer, the utility must use forward-looking cost allocators (estimates of the customer's cost responsibility
when the facility will be in service).

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 Therefore, the fact that a utility has recovered CWIP from a particular customer (without the customer's objection)
may provide persuasive evidence of a reasonable expectation that it would continue to serve that customer for a certain
term. The Commission is aware, however, that few utilities have taken advantage of the CWIP rule, perhaps because
few utilities have been undertaking major construction projects.

A reasonable expectation that a contract would be extended could also be shown by communications between supplier
and customer concerning system planning. For example, if a buyer has indicated that the seller should continue to
include the buyer's load in the seller's resource planning beyond the contract term or has indicated to the seller
that it has not taken active steps to secure a new supplier, the seller may have legitimately had a reasonable expectation
of continuing the service, particularly if the parties have routinely extended the contract in the past. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
On the other hand, a utility very likely would have no reasonable expectation that a contract would be extended if the
contract includes a notice of cancellation provision. Therefore, there will be a rebuttable presumption that if
a contract contains a notice provision, the utility had no reasonable expectation of serving the customer beyond
the period provided for in the notice provision. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
The Commission invites comments on all aspects of the evidence necessary to demonstrate a reasonable expectation.
We specifically request comments on our proposal that any notice provision creates a rebuttable presumption of no
reasonable expectation, or whether we should adopt a minimum notice period that would provide a presumption that
the utility had no reasonable expectation of continuing to provide service beyond the notice period, e.g., a five-year
notice period.
