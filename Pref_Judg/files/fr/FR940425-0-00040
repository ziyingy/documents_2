NHTSA received only two specific comments about the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
benefits of the proposed rulemaking to establish requirements 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
for CNG vehicles. Both Atlantic Research Corporation and NGVC 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
commented that the agency's assumption about estimating future 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
CNG vehicle fires is flawed because it assumes that CNG 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
vehicles will have the same fire rate as gasoline powered 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
vehicles. Both commenters stated that the fuel systems and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the fuel flammability characteristics are completely different 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
and thus would result in much lower fire rates for CNG 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
vehicles. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
NHTSA acknowledges the favorable flammability 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
characteristics of CNG relative to gasoline. CNG is lighter 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
than air, and therefore should quickly dissipate upward. At 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the same time, however, CNG is under high pressure onboard the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
vehicle in contrast to conventional fuels. This high pressure 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
could make a crash situation more volatile. However, without 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
real-world crash data on CNG vehicles, no conclusions can be 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
drawn. In assuming that CNG vehicles had the same fire rate 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
as gasoline vehicles, the agency wished to provide some 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
estimate of benefits, given the lack of real world accidents 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
because of the relatively few CNG vehicles on the road. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
NHTSA analyzed data submitted by the American Gas 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Association (AGA) on 8,000 natural gas fleet vehicles. Based 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
on vehicle miles travelled (VMT) during a three-year period, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the fire rate for CNG vehicles is 2.52 per 100 million VMT, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
compared with a gasoline vehicle fire rate of 1.87, or 35 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
percent higher. However, the agency notes that the small 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
sample does not allow a reliable analysis of the crash fire 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
potential in CNG vehicles. With seven fires, the standard 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
errors or the fire rates for these CNG vehicles are too big to 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
make meaningful comparisons between CNG-equipped vehicles and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
their gasoline counterparts. While the agency does not have 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the data to determine comparable fire rates between gasoline 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
and CNG vehicles, the benefits of this final rule are obtained 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
by ensuring at least equivalent safety with gasoline vehicles.

3. Costs

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
In the NPRM, NHTSA estimated that testing associated with 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the proposed vehicle requirements would cost approximately 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
$58,530&hyph;$63,080 per CNG body style. The agency estimated 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
that the cost to perform a frontal, lateral or rear impact 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
test would be $5,000 (with a total cost of $15,000 for three 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
tests). The cost of the vehicle, which is destroyed during 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the test, is approximately $13,160 ($39,480 for the three 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
vehicles to be used in the three tests). Thus, the total 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
vehicle testing costs would be approximately $54,480. The 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
agency requested comments about the costs of complying with 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the proposed requirements. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
NHTSA received two comments that addressed the cost of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
implementing fuel system integrity requirements for CNG 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
vehicles. Navistar and Blue Bird stated that the agency 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
underestimated the costs associated with testing school buses 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
to the new CNG standard. Each stated that the cost associated 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
with purchasing and testing school buses was substantially 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
higher than the NPRM's estimate. Navistar estimated that for 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
a six fuel tank design school bus, the costs would be as 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
follows: chassis_$35,000, six fuel containers at $1,200 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
each_$7,200; six fuel container cages at $150 each_$900; 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
associated valves, tubes, fittings, etc. $1,000; crash testing 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
at $12,000 per test ($36,000 for three tests). Navistar 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
stated that a minimum of two school buses and six crash tests 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
would be needed for a total of at least $160,000. Blue Bird 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
estimated that vehicle costs are in the range of $75,000 to 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
$85,000 and each test costs approximately $15,000. It further 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
stated that test costs could be several hundred thousand 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
dollars per vehicle configuration given that multiple impact 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
tests are often necessary to document conformance to a 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
standard that requires impacts at any point and angle. If 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Blue Bird performed six tests on two school buses, the total 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
cost would range from $240,000 to $260,000. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
After reviewing the comments, NHTSA believes that the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
cost estimates provided by Navistar and Blue Bird are 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
reasonable. Thus, the total cost of testing school buses 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
would be $160,000 per chassis and $260,000 for a school bus. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
NHTSA continues to believe that its estimate of $54,480 for 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
light vehicles is still appropriate.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
In the NPRM, NHTSA proposed to make the vehicle 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
requirements effective on September 1, 1994. The agency 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
believed that this would provide a reasonable time period for 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
manufacturers to make any vehicle modifications required by 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the rulemaking. Nevertheless, the agency stated that the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
proposed dynamic vehicle crash test requirements could make it 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
necessary for vehicle manufacturers to make significant design 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
modifications in order to comply with the proposal, especially 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
since most CNG vehicles are currently manufactured in 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
accordance with NFPA Standard 52. That standard specifies 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
design-oriented requirements and does not specify a barrier 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
crash test. The agency requested comment on the feasibility 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
of this effective date.
