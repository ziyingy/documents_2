The vineyards in the viticultural area are located at an elevation of 800&hyph;900 feet along south and southwest
facing slopes of 10&hyph;40 percent gradient. This combination of elevation, aspect, and relief contributes to
the well-drained quality of the vineyard soils, the free circulation of air in summer and winter, and the locally longer
growing season. Outside the viticultural area to the north and west, higher elevations of 900&hyph;1,200 feet increase
the risk of wind damage to grapevines, or the soils become too shallow for successful grape cultivation where bedrock
is nearer the surface or exposed. Outside the viticultural area to the east, elevations between 720 feet (Wisconsin
River level) and 800 feet are generally less well drained or are saturated during periods of rainfall or snowmelt.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The Lake Wisconsin viticultural area benefits from the microclimate effects of the lower Wisconsin River valley.
The river moderates winter temperatures in the viticultural area several degrees higher than areas north and west
of the river or further south. Air circulation within the river valley helps prevent cold air accumulation and frost
pockets from forming in the vineyards. In summer, the river valley and limestone bluffs along the river's edge serve
to channel air currents and increase localized air circulation, protecting the vineyards from mildew and rot in hot,
humid weather.

The viticultural area has a mean precipitation of twenty-nine inches, one inch less than the average rainfall in the
area north and east, three inches less than the average rainfall in the area to the west, and two inches less than the
State average. The petitioner describes the viticultural area as an ``island'' of locally below-average rainfall
and drier soils conducive to the grapevines concentrating their vigor in ripening fruit. The viticultural area has
a growing season of 140&hyph;160 days, ten to twenty days longer than across the river to the west and to the north. The
additional frost-free period allows the grapes to reach maturity before the onset of winter cold.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The Wisconsin River forms an approximate dividing line between the glaciated and unglaciated regions of south-central
Wisconsin. Soils primarily of glacial till and outwash material are found east of the river valley and characterize
the soils in the viticultural area. The unglaciated ``driftless'' soils west of the valley result from significant
differences in soil parent materials, microrelief, and drainage. The soils that support viticulture within the
viticultural area are Typic Hapludalfs of mixed mineral material and silty or loamy texture. All are underlain by
gravelly or sandy loam glacial till or by dolomitic bedrock. The soils are typically well drained and about 36&hyph;60
inches deep on slopes and rolling areas of 2&hyph;45 percent gradient. The soils outside the viticultural area to
the north and west are predominately unglaciated, and so are not underlain by glacial till and contain less outwash
material. The soils outside the area to the south and east, although glacially derived, are found on topography of
rolling upland with fewer limestone outcrops and no outwash plains. The soils there have formed on slightly higher
elevations over discontinuous end and ground moraines.

It has been determined that this rule is not a significant regulatory action, because

(1) It will not have an annual effect on the economy of $100 million or more or adversely affect in a material way the economy,

Regulatory Flexibility Act

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
It is hereby certified that this regulation will not have a significant economic impact on a substantial number of
small entities. The establishment of a viticultural area is neither an endorsement nor approval by ATF of the quality
of wine produced in the area, but rather an identification of an area that is distinct from surrounding areas. This
process merely allows wineries to more accurately describe the origin of their wines to the consumers, and helps consumers
identify the wines they purchase. Designation of a viticultural area itself has no significant economic impact because
any commercial advantage can come only from consumer acceptance of wines made from grapes grown within the area. In
addition, no new recordkeeping or reporting requirements are imposed. Accordingly, a regulatory flexibility analysis
is not required.
