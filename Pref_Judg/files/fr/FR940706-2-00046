SUMMARY:
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
 Pursuant to section 6(b) of the Federal Insecticide, Fungicide, and Rodenticide Act (FIFRA), this Notice announces
EPA's intent to cancel the following pesticide registrations for simazine products used in swimming pools, hot tubs,
and whirlpool baths: Nuclo Dry Granular Algaecide (EPA Reg. No. 7124&hyph;32) and Nuclo Dry Algaecide 90 (EPA Reg.
No. 7124&hyph;93), produced by Alden Leeds, Inc.; and Winterizing Algaecide (EPA Reg. No. 3432&hyph;33) and Algicil
Plus (EPA Reg. No. 3432&hyph;54), produced by N. Jonas Company. EPA is taking this action because it believes that
the use of the products, in accordance with widespread and commonly recognized practice, generally causes unreasonable
adverse effects on the environment. Specifically, EPA is concerned with potential cancer and non-cancer effects
resulting from exposure to simazine in swimming pools. EPA believes that the risks from this particular simazine
use exceed the benefits derived from this use. Effective the date of final cancellation, EPA will not allow further
sale, distribution, or use of existing stocks of these products, as described in this Notice. Holders of existing
stocks are subject to FIFRA section 6(g) reporting requirements.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=2 -->
This Notice announces EPA's intent to cancel the following pesticide registrations for simazine products used in
swimming pools, hot tubs, and whirlpool baths: Nuclo Dry Granular Algaecide (EPA Reg. No. 7124&hyph;32), Nuclo Dry
Algaecide 90 (EPA Reg. No. 7124&hyph;93), Winterizing Algaecide (EPA Reg. No. 3432&hyph;33), and Algicil Plus (EPA
Reg. No. 3432&hyph;54). For the reasons set forth below, the Administrator has made the determination that these
products, when used in accordance with widespread and commonly recognized practice, generally cause unreasonable
adverse effects on the environment.

B. Legal Authority 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=2 -->
Before a pesticide product may be lawfully sold or distributed in either intrastate or interstate commerce, the product
must be registered by EPA pursuant to FIFRA section 3(a) (7 U.S.C. 136a(a)). A registration is a license allowing a
pesticide product to be sold and distributed for specified uses in accordance with use instructions, precautions,
and other terms and conditions of the registration. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In order to obtain a registration for a pesticide under FIFRA, an applicant must demonstrate that the pesticide satisfies
the statutory standard for registration, section 3(c)(5) of FIFRA (7 U.S.C. 136a(c)(5)). That standard requires,
among other things, that the pesticide performs its intended function without causing ``unreasonable adverse effects
on the environment.'' The term ``unreasonable adverse effects on the environment'' is defined under FIFRA section
2(bb) as ``any unreasonable risk to man or the environment, taking into account the economic, social, and environmental
costs and benefits of the use of any pesticide'' (7 U.S.C. 136(bb)). This standard requires a finding that the benefits
of the use of the pesticide exceed the risks of use, when the pesticide is used in compliance with the terms and conditions
of registration or in accordance with commonly recognized practices. The burden of demonstrating that a pesticide
product satisfies the statutory criteria for registration is at all times on the proponents of registration, and
continues as long as the registration is in effect

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Under FIFRA section 6(b), EPA may issue a notice of intent to cancel the registration of a pesticide product whenever
it appears to the Administrator that the product, when used in accordance with widespread and generally recognized
practice, generally causes unreasonable effects (7 U.S.C. 136d(b)). 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Registrants and other adversely affected persons may request a hearing on the cancellation of a specified registration
and use. If they do so in a legally effective manner, the registration and use will be continued pending a decision at
the conclusion of an administrative hearing.

II. Background 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
In 1989, EPA classified simazine as a possible human carcinogen (Ref. 1). Simazine is used primarily as an agricultural
herbicide; swimming pool use accounts for less than 2 percent of total simazine usage. In August 1993, EPA conducted
a risk assessment for the swimming pool use (Ref. 2). The risk assessment revealed high potential cancer and non-cancer
health risks to children and adults exposed to water treated with simazine algaecides. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Because of its risk concerns, EPA requested that the 13 registrants of the simazine swimming pool algaecides cease
product formulation and voluntarily cancel their product registrations (Refs. 3 and 4). In response to EPA's request,
nine of the registrants--A &amp; V, Great Lakes Biochemical, Applied Biochemists, Aqua Clear Industries, Western
Purity Biochemical, Poolmaster, Leslie's Pool Supplies, York Chemical, and Quantum Biochemical--requested a
FIFRA section 6(f) voluntary product cancellation. Also, pursuant to FIFRA section 4(i)(5)(D), EPA canceled two
registrations held by EZ-Clor Systems and one held by N. Jonas Company, for failure to pay the annual registration
maintenance fees for those registrations. The cancellation order for the registrations held by these 11 registrants
was published on April 15, 1994 (59 FR 18120). A separate order, cancelling the registration of Aladdin Winter Care
(EPA Reg. No. 11329&hyph;17) for failure to pay the annual registration maintenance fee for that product registration,
was signed on May 16, 1994. The order was published in the 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 -->
Federal Register
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 and became effective on May 25, 1994 (59 FR 27016). 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Alden Leeds and N. Jonas Co. still hold the following registrations for the following simazine products: Nuclo Dry
Granular Algaecide (EPA Reg. No. 7124&hyph;32), Nuclo Dry Algaecide 90 (EPA Reg. No. 7124&hyph;93), Winterizing
Algaecide (EPA Reg. No. 3432&hyph;33), and Algicil Plus (EPA Reg. No. 3432&hyph;54). 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The three registrants of technical simazine--Ciba-Geigy, Drexel Chemical, and Oxon-Italia--are not supporting
the swimming pool simazine use. That is, these manufacturers of the simazine active ingredient do not have their simazine
products registered for swimming pool-related uses. None of Drexel Chemical's products were registered for aquatic
use, and Ciba-Geigy and Oxon-Italia had ceased supporting all aquatic uses before EPA conducted its risk assessment.
The aquatic-use cancellation for Ciba-Geigy, the supplier of technical simazine for the swimming pool products,
was published in the 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 -->
Federal Register
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 on July 1, 1992 (57 FR 29309) and became effective on October 9, 1992. The notice of Oxon-Italia's request for aquatic
use cancellations was published in the 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 -->
Federal Register
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 on February 9, 1994 (59 FR 6021), and became effective 90 days from that publication date. At EPA's request, Ciba-Geigy
and Oxon-Italia have amended their product labels to explicitly prohibit reformulation of their products into swimming
pool products; Drexel has amended its technical simazine label to prohibit formulation into aquatic-use products.
Because manufacturers of simazine swimming pool products must formulate their products from technical simazine,
the effect of these actions is that there is no legal source of simazine active ingredient from which the swimming pool
product manufacturers may formulate any simazine products.

III. Summary of Toxicological Concerns 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Based on toxicological studies in laboratory animals, EPA has determined that simazine may pose cancer and non-cancer
risks to individuals exposed to this pesticide. The results of these studies, as well as the EPA classification of
the carcinogenic potential of simazine, are described below. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 -->
A. Carcinogenicity 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
EPA reviewed the simazine toxicological data base, including rat and mouse chronic feeding/carcinogenicity studies,
in its evaluation of the carcinogenic potential of simazine. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
1.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
 Rat study.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 In a 2&hyph;year chronic feeding carcinogenicity study, simazine technical was administered in the diet of 340 male
and 340 female Sprague-Dawley (SD) rats (MRID No. 40614405). The study had two phases: a carcinogenicity phase and
a chronic phase. An equal number of male and female rats were randomly divided into four major groups; 50 animals/sex/group
were used in the carcinogenicity phase, and 30 to 40 animals/sex/group were used in the chronic phase. Animals were
dosed at 0 (control), 10, 100, or 1,000 ppm of simazine for 2 years (corresponding to 0.41, 4.17, or 45.77 mg/kg/day
in males; and 0.52, 5.34, or 63.10 mg/kg/day in females). 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
For the carcinogenicity phase, results in the female SD rats indicated that there was a statistically significant
dose-related trend in mammary gland carcinomas, as well as in combined adenomas and carcinomas. The incidence of
mammary gland carcinomas was statistically significantly increased at both the 100 and 1,000 ppm groups, as compared
to the controls. Also, the incidence of combined adenomas and carcinomas was statistically significantly higher
in the highest dose tested (HDT) group, as compared to the controls. Mammary gland carcinomas in the main study contributed
to increased mortality in the HDT animals. A higher incidence of mammary gland carcinomas was also seen in the recovery
study (52 weeks of treatment at 1,000 ppm, followed by 52 weeks of recovery) for the control (1/10) and the HDT (4/10)
animals. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The incidence of hyperplastic changes (cystic glandular hyperplasia) in the mammary glands of female rats was statistically
significantly higher in the HDT animals than in the controls. This finding correlates with the observed high incidence
of tumors in the HDT group. It is generally understood that the higher tumor incidence correlates directly with a higher
incidence of hyperplastic changes. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In the female rats, the incidence of pituitary carcinomas was found to be statistically significantly higher in the
HDT animals than in the controls. The incidence of pituitary adenomas was found to be extremely high in all groups.
Further statistical analysis of these tumors (total tumor analysis) indicated that the incidence of combined adenomas/carcinomas
in the mid- and high-dose groups was statistically significantly higher than in the controls, and also exhibited
a significant increasing dose-related trend. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
There was a statistically significant dose-related trend for the incidence of kidney tubular adenomas in female
rats. However, the tumors occurred only at the HDT, and the incidence was not statistically significant as compared
to the control animals. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In the male SD rats, the incidence of hepatocellular adenomas or carcinomas was very low in all treated and control
groups. The incidence of combined hepatocellular adenomas and carcinomas was statistically significantly higher
in the HDT group, as compared to the control group. These incidences fell within the historical control range for this
testing facility. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
A very low incidence of kidney tubular adenomas and carcinomas was seen in male rats. A statistically significant
dose-related trend was observed for the incidence of carcinomas, as well as for the incidence of combined adenomas
and carcinomas. However, tumors occurred only at the HDT, and tumor incidences were not statistically significantly
elevated as compared to concurrent controls. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
For this study, the Health Effects Division (HED) of the Office of Pesticide Programs Cancer Peer Review Committee
concluded that the highest dose exceeded the Maximum Tolerated Dose (MTD) for female rats, based on excess deaths
and body-weight-gain reductions. The Committee also agreed that the highest dose in male rats appeared to have exceeded
the MTD, based on a significant decrease in body-weight gain. However, the mid-level dose was well below the MTD, and
mammary gland tumors in the female rat were statistically significantly increased at both the mid- and high-dose
levels. In addition, the Committee concluded that there was too great an interval between the mid (100 ppm) and high
(1,000 ppm) doses. These factors were taken into account in the weight-of-evidence considerations that led the Committee
to classify simazine as a possible human carcinogen (Ref. 2). 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

2.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
 Mouse study.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 There is no evidence of a relationship between simazine exposure and carcinogenicity in the mouse. In a 1988 chronic
feeding/carcinogenicity study in mice, simazine technical was administered in the diet to a group of 60 male and 60
female CD1 (ICR) BR mice at 0 (control), 40, 1,000, or 4,000 ppm for 95 weeks (MRID No. 40614404). There were no increases
in neoplasms reported for any dosed group and no evidence of compound-related effect on survival or target organ toxicity.

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
 Classification of carcinogenic potential.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 Based on the weight-of-evidence, the HED Cancer Peer Review Committee concluded that simazine should be classified
as a Group C possible human carcinogen (Ref. 2). This determination was primarily based on results from the 2&hyph;year
chronic feeding/carcinogenicity study in rats. Based on EPA's evaluation of the data presented in this study, EPA
concluded that technical-grade simazine is carcinogenic in female SD rats, inducing the formation of mammary gland
carcinomas. There is evidence in the published literature that simazine has genotoxic activity, and this was considered
in the weight-of-evidence evaluation of simazine's carcinogenicity classification.

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
 Rat study.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 EPA determined that the 2&hyph;year rat chronic feeding study, described in unit III. A.1. of this notice, was appropriate
for assessing non-cancer risks for ``competitive'' exposure to simazine. A No Observed Effect Level (NOEL) of 0.52
mg/kg/day was established based on decreased body weight gain and depression of hematological parameters that occurred
at 5.34 mg/kg/day. These effects, which include depressed red-blood-cell count, hemoglobin, and hematocrit, are
considered to be reversible when exposure is terminated. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
2.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
 Rabbit study.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 For evaluation of non-cancer risks from ``recreational'' exposure to simazine, EPA based its risk assessment on
the results of a rabbit developmental toxicity study (MRID No. 001611407). 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In this study, 19 female New Zealand White rabbits per dose level were artificially inseminated and administered
technical grade simazine once daily by gastric intubation at doses of 5 mg/kg, 75 mg/kg, and 200 mg/kg of body weight.
A significant reduction in mean fetal weight and a significant increase in the incidence of fetuses with skeletal
variations were observed at the 200 mg/kg dose level. Therefore, the developmental NOEL for this study is 75 mg/kg
of body weight. In the mothers, significant decreases in body weight gain, tremors, and abortions were observed in
the mid- and high-dose groups (75 and 200 mg/kg dose levels). The maternal NOEL was therefore established at 5 mg/kg
of body weight. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 -->
IV. Exposure Assessment 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
EPA developed four exposure scenarios based on the frequency and duration of exposure (competitive versus recreational
swimming), and on the age and weight of the swimmer (6&hyph;year&hyph;old child versus 35&hyph;year&hyph;old male).
The assessment assumed exposure to the entire body through dermal, oral, buccal and sublingual, orbital and nasal,
aural, and inhalation routes. High-exposure frequency, or ``competitive,'' 6&hyph;year&hyph;old and 35&hyph;year&hyph;old
swimmers are assumed to have daily exposures of 3 and 5 hours, respectively, for 150 days per year (Ref. 5). Based on
these assumptions, EPA estimates that ``competitive'' swimmers are exposed to an Actual Daily Exposure (ADE) of
0.12 mg/kg/day for children, and 0.07 mg/kg/day for adults. Low-exposure frequency, or ``recreational,'' swimmers
of both age groups are assumed to be exposed for 30 minutes per day, 5 days a year. This low exposure results in an ADE of
0.02 mg/kg/day for children and 0.0073 mg/kg/day for adults. EPA assumed that lifetime exposure constitutes 30 years
of exposure over a 75&hyph;year lifetime. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Simazine concentrations in swimming pool water were calculated based on label application rates. Although simazine
is soluble to only 3.5 parts per million (ppm) in water at 68 
<!-- PJG 0040 degreeslatlong -->
&cir;F, EPA assumed that swimmers could be exposed to average simazine concentrations of 5 ppm, because solubility
could increase at temperatures above 68 
<!-- PJG 0040 degreeslatlong -->
&cir;F. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
EPA has concluded that it is not necessary to conduct a separate exposure assessment for the simazine product that
is used to control algae in swimming pools during the off-season or winter months. A separate assessment is unnecessary
because the exposure levels for the winter-use (winterizer) product are comparable to the exposure levels for the
non-winterizer simazine swimming pool products. Label application rates for winterizer and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
non-winterizer products are similar. In addition, label directions do not require swimming pools that have been
treated with winterizer products to be drained before they are used by swimmers. Because EPA has no data concerning
simazine dissipation, EPA must assume that following initial or subsequent winterizer treatment, simazine does
not dissipate from swimming pool water. Consequently, swimmers could be exposed to unacceptable levels of simazine
when winterized swimming pools are opened for use. Therefore, EPA believes that the individual risk posed to swimmers
from exposure to simazine used as a winterizer is not significantly different from other exposure scenarios.

, based on mammary gland cancer in laboratory animals. The Scientific Advisory Panel (SAP) reviewed the carcinogenicity
of simazine in September 1989 and, while agreeing with the Group C classification, did not recommend the use of a quantitative
risk assessment (Ref. 6). The SAP noted that certain pesticides, such as simazine, may alter endocrine physiology
in the rat and influence the incidence of mammary gland tumors; the SAP therefore recommended that EPA formulate a
position on the regulation of chemicals with this mechanism.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
At a subsequent OPP Cancer Peer Review Committee meeting, the Peer Review Committee evaluated the SAP's recommendation

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
EPA measures non-cancer risks by calculating a margin of exposure (MOE), which is a comparison of the NOEL to actual
daily exposure, both of which are expressed in milligrams of chemical dose per kilogram of body weight per day. An MOE
less than 100 generally represents an unacceptable risk.

Non-cancer risk to swimmers from high exposure frequency.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 The high exposure frequency assumed for the competitive swimmer categories necessitated the use of a long-term toxicity
study to calculate non-cancer risk. The 2&hyph;year chronic rat feeding study was therefore used to calculate the
MOEs for competitive swimmers. The risks to swimmers for the non-cancer effects seen in the chronic study--reduction
in body weight gain and depression of hematological parameters (anemia)--are reflected in MOEs of 4.3 for children
and 7.4 for adults. The MOEs for swimmers in the competitive category, based on effects seen in the chronic feeding
study, are well below 100 and therefore indicate an unacceptable risk.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
 Non-cancer risk to swimmers from low exposure frequency.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 EPA does not consider swimmers exposed at a low exposure frequency (i.e., a few short exposures per year) to be at risk
of exhibiting non-cancer effects (Ref. 8). Because of the low exposure frequency assumed for the recreational swimmer
categories, the rabbit developmental toxicity study was used to calculate MOEs. The effects of reduction in maternal
body weight gain, abortions, and tremors were manifested at very high dose levels and are considered signs of general
systemic toxicity in the test animals. EPA calculated MOEs of 250 for children and 685 for adults exposed to simazine
in swimming pools. This indicates that recreational swimmers are not at risk from the effects seen in the developmental
toxicity study.

VI. Benefits and Impact of Cancellation 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Under FIFRA, a pesticide registration may only be maintained if the benefits of the use of the pesticide exceed the
risks of use. EPA has found that at least some of the registered alternative algaecides provide comparative control
at comparative prices, during summer season use. EPA has concluded that the benefits associated with Nuclo Dry Granular
Algaecide, Nuclo Dry Algaecide 90, and Algicil Plus are negligible when compared to the total operating costs on a
per&hyph;pool basis. The cancellation of these products for summer use will have a negligible impact on the pool industry
and the public. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
EPA has also found that the benefits associated with Winterizing Algaecide are relatively small. This information
is based on the fact that there are a number of alternatives to simazine winterizing products on the market, and the
labels of many of these alternative products indicate that they are used at a similar frequency as simazine. Although
EPA has anecdotal information that suggests simazine may have a longer duration of activity, which could, if true,
result in a cost savings, there are no data to support this. Therefore, EPA concludes that the loss of simazine winterizing
products would have only a small impact on the swimming pool industry and the public. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The cancellation of the four products subject to this Notice will not have a significant economic impact in part because
they account for only a small share of the algaecide market for swimming pool use. EPA estimates that all 22 simazine
products account for less than 10 percent of the market for algaecides for swimming pool use. Registrants of 18 of these
products have already requested voluntary cancellation of their registrations, or have had their registrations
canceled for maintenance fee non-payment. The remaining four products subject to this Notice account for less than
1 percent of the total swimming pool algaecide market. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The economic impact of cancelling these four products is minimized by the availability of registered alternative
algaecides for swimming pool use. Because these alternatives have a substantially greater market share than simazine,
the cancellation of the four products subject to this Notice should not result in significant price increases in the
non-simazine products. For the same reasons, EPA does not expect market dislocations due to the inability to produce
the alternative algaecides to meet demand. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Alden Leeds and N. Jonas Co. indicated to EPA that they have accounted for approximately 25,000 gallons of liquid product
in their possession or in the channels of trade, and 14,000 pounds of unformulated Ciba-Geigy simazine product that
Ciba-Geigy has agreed to buy back. Given the small amount of these products and the over 3 million swimming pools in
the United States that could use simazine pool products, cancellation of these products would have little impact
on the swimming pool industry. Section 6(b) of FIFRA requires EPA to consider the impact of cancellation upon the agricultural
economy (7 U.S.C. 136d(b)). EPA has determined that the cancellation of these products will have no impact upon the
agricultural economy because these products are registered for swimming pool use, and not for agricultural uses.

VII. Risk/Benefit Assessment 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Under section 6(b) of FIFRA, the Administrator may cancel a pesticide due to unreasonable adverse effects, if the
pesticide generally causes an ``unreasonable risk to man or the environment, taking into account the economic, social,
and environmental costs and benefits'' of the pesticide's use (7 U.S.C. 136d(b)). 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
As discussed in the preceding sections of this Notice, the cancer and non- cancer risks to human health from continued
registration of Nuclo Dry Granular Algaecide, Nuclo Dry Algaecide 90, Winterizing Algaecide, and Algicil Plus are
significant, while the benefits of continued registration are negligible for summer use, and are relatively small
for the winterizing use. EPA believes that the risks posed by continued registration are unreasonable when compared
to the benefits, and that simazine use in swimming pools should be canceled.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In making its determination to propose cancellation, EPA has also examined whether any measures short of cancellation
exist to reduce exposure to acceptable levels, and has concluded that there are none. For the summer use, no measures
could be identified to reduce risk to an acceptable range. For the winterizer use, EPA considered allowing registrants
to retain that use, if data were submitted that showed that superchlorination of pools following simazine use eliminated
the product from treated water. No such data were submitted to EPA. Therefore, EPA has determined that for both the
summer and winter use, there are no acceptable measures short of cancellation.

VIII. Role of the Scientific Advisory Panel and the Secretary of Agriculture 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Sections 6(b) and 25(d) of FIFRA provide certain opportunities for the FIFRA Scientific Advisory Panel (SAP) and
the Secretary of the Department of Agriculture (USDA) to review and comment upon a draft NOIC, and in the case of USDA,
an analysis of the impact of the proposed action on the agricultural economy. These reviews may be waived, and when
they are, the Notice may be published without delay. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
On April 5, 1994, EPA asked the SAP and Secretary of USDA to waive their rights to review and comment on this Notice (Refs.
9 and 10). On April 12, 1994, Nancy Ragsdale, Director, National Agricultural Pesticide Impact Assessment Program,
USDA, notified EPA that the Secretary would waive review of this action (Ref. 11). On May 25, 1994, the SAP notified
EPA that it waived its review of this action (Ref. 12). Because the SAP and USDA have waived their review of this action,
EPA is issuing this Notice without delay.

IX. Disposition of Existing Stocks 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
For purposes of this Notice, existing stocks are defined as those stocks of simazine products for use in swimming pools
that were in the United States and were packaged, labeled, and released for shipment prior to July 6, 1994. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
EPA has an established policy for determinations concerning the sale, distribution, and use of existing stocks of
canceled pesticides (56 FR 29362, June 26, 1991). That policy states that in cases where EPA has identified a significant
risk concern and the registration is canceled, EPA will make existing stocks determinations on a case-by-case basis.
In most cases EPA will not permit the continued sale, distribution, or use of existing stocks of a canceled product
raising risk concerns unless it can be demonstrated that the benefits exceed the risks. EPA reserves the right to amend
this existing stocks provision, should conditions warrant such amendment. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The swimming pool use of simazine poses unreasonable cancer and non- cancer risk. As discussed in units VI and VII of
this Notice, the benefits of continued sale, distribution, and use of existing stocks are negligible and do not outweigh
the risks. Finally, EPA has taken steps to minimize the amount of stocks that are currently in the hands of registrants,
retailers, and distributors. In December 1993, EPA notified registrants of the risks associated with the products
and asked them to stop formulating, selling, and distributing their products (Ref. 4). 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
EPA has determined that no person may sell, distribute, or use the existing stocks of any product subject to this Notice
except for: (1) Sale or distribution up through the chain of distribution to the former registrant of that product,
or (2) for lawful disposal. It is the responsibility of the basic registrants to notify any and all supplementally
registered distributors of their product(s) that this Notice also applies to their supplementally registered products.
Registrants may be held liable for violations committed by their distributors. Any sale, distribution, or use of
existing stocks of canceled products other than as provided in this Notice will be considered a violation of FIFRA
12(a)(2)(J). 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Notwithstanding any other provision of this Notice, the distribution or sale of canceled products will be allowed
if such distribution or sale is for the purpose of collecting products for relabeling, reformulation, disposal,
or export to a country where the use of simazine is not prohibited, or any other lawful purpose not inconsistent with
the provisions of this Notice. In order for exported existing stocks of canceled simazine to qualify for this exception,
such stocks must comply with all the labeling requirements identified in FIFRA section 17(1)(a) and the foreign purchaser
acknowledgement requirements identified in FIFRA section 17(a)(2). In order to be considered to be in compliance
with these provisions, the exporter must follow the procedures specified in the EPA's Export Policy and Procedures
for Exporting Unregistered Pesticides at 40 CFR part 168, subpart D.

Pursuant to FIFRA section 6(g), any producer or exporter, registrant, applicant for a registration, applicant or
holder of an experimental use permit, commercial applicator, or any person who distributes or sells any pesticide,
who possesses any stocks of pesticide products containing simazine subject to this Notice that are canceled by a final
order issued either in the absence of or following a hearing on cancellation (hereafter, referred to as ``affected
persons,'' which includes affected individuals, partnerships, associations, corporations, or any organized
group of persons whether incorporated or not) must notify the EPA and appropriate State and local officials of: (1)
Such possession; (2) the quantity of canceled simazine pesticide product possessed; and, (3) the place at which the
canceled simazine pesticide product is stored. Notification by affected persons to EPA and designated State and
local officials pursuant to FIFRA section 6(g) shall be in accordance with the procedures, time frames, and requirements
set out in this Unit. End users, except commercial applicators, are not required to report their stocks of canceled
simazine products.
