Symptom checklists are used in epidemiologic research to identify the pattern of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
subjective complaints, which can be used to guide the selection of objective assessment 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
methods. The distribution of symptoms can be correlated with indices of exposure to 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
determine if particular symptoms are more prevalent in exposed persons (Sjogren et al., 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
1990). 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Self-report data are notable for biases that may influence them; these biases are well 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
known in epidemiology, clinical practice, and social science. Even in the most superficial of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
questions, respondents may consciously or unknowingly bias the answer to fit what they 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
believe to be the examiner's expectations. Details of objective events or subjective states are 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
subject to alteration; recall and reporting of remembered occurrences may be biased to fit 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
interpretations and expectations. The socioeconomic status, gender, and affiliation of the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
tester also have been identified as biasing variables. Bias occurs when information is 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
requested about behaviors, beliefs, or feelings believed by the respondent to be socially 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
undesirable or when reinforcement contingencies (e.g., litigation) strongly favor selective 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
reporting. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Biases in self-report data can be reduced by making the questionnaire anonymous or 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
highly confidential; objective data can be used to validate self-reports. Ethnographic 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
observations, objective measurement of behavior, biologic samples, and the observations of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
significant others are employed to validate self-report data. Consistent descriptions of events 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
by several persons lend credence to the reliability of the report. Many clinical interviews 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
and self-report assessment instruments include some mechanisms for detecting self-report 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
bias, either by looking for endorsement of improbable behaviors, or by examining the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
consistency of information gathered in several ways or from several sources. Concordance 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
among biologic indices, observations, and physical examinations increases the judged validity 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
of self-reports.

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Changes in mood and emotionality can be consequences of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
neurotoxicity. For example, case reports have identified mood changes from exposure to 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
mercury, lead, solvents, and organophosphate insecticides. The Taylor Manifest Anxiety 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Scale and the Profile of Mood States (POMS) are standardized self-report assessment 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
instruments for which there is some evidence of sensitivity to chemical insult. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The POMS, a component of the Neurobehavioral Core Test Battery, is a self-report 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
measure that asks respondents to use a 5-point scale to rate the magnitude of 65 subjective 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
states, such as ``tense,'' ``relaxed,'' ``hopeless,'' ``guilty,'' etc., that they have experienced 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
within the past week. The responses are scored according to six mood factors, and a Total 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Mood Disturbance Score also may be calculated. Liang et al. (1990) used the POMS to 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
evaluate lead-exposed workers (mean blood lead concentration of 41 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=6 f=1 -->
m
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
g/dL) from a battery 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
plant and a control group from a fabric-weaving manufacturer. Exposed workers were 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
significantly higher on tension, depression, anger, fatigue, and confusion scales. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Mood scales were developed to aid in assessment of psychological disorders, such as 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
depression, and to track treatment response. In addition, mood is modulated by metabolic 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
and endocrine variables in health and disease and can change rapidly in response to 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
interpersonal, workplace, and environmental events. The large number of nonchemical 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
variables and the lability of mood make inclusion of carefully selected controls essential in 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
using affect as an endpoint in neurotoxicity research. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The validity of mood scales may be limited to the specific populations in which the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
validity studies were performed. As characterizations of internal states, the meaning of the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
descriptors in the POMS established for one culture may not be the same as the meaning of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
that concept or term in other cultures or in other language systems. There may be variations 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
in interpretation of the terms by respondents across English-speaking subcultures, perhaps as 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
a function of education or the size of the verbal community. While these differences may 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
not impede a global clinical interpretation, the reduction in generalizability across study 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
populations may be sufficient to decrease the usefulness of subjective scales in quantitative 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
neurotoxicity risk assessment.

3.3.6.2. Personality scales.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The Minnesota Multiphasic Personality Inventory (MMPI), the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Cattell 16 PF, and the Eysenck Personality Inventory have occasionally been used in 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
neurotoxicity research. Exposed and nonexposed groups have differed on several scales 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
derived from these standardized questionnaires. The diagnostic power of the MMPI, for 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
example, is not in the individual scales but in the pattern of scores on the 10 clinical and 3 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
validity scales. Because interpretation of the MMPI requires a trained diagnostician with 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
experience in the population of interest, it is less likely to be useful in quantitative 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
neurotoxicity assessment.
