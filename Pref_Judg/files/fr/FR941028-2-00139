If no such short-term needs match the amount of funds that are available for the period such funds are available, the

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(1) Obligations issued or guaranteed by the United States; 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(2) Obligations issued or guaranteed by any person controlled or supervised by and acting as an instrumentality of
the U.S. pursuant to authority granted by the Congress of the U.S.; 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(3) Obligations issued or guaranteed by any state or political subdivision thereof, provided that such obligations
are rated for investment purposes at not less than ``A'' by Moody's Investors Service, Inc. (``Moody's'') or by Standard
&amp; Poors Corporation (``S&amp;P'');  
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(4) Commercial paper rated not less than ``P&hyph;1'' by Moody's or not less than ``A&hyph;1'' by S&amp;P; or  
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

The Applicants (other than North Atlantic, HEC and Quinnehtuk) also request authority to secure both formal and informal
credit lines with a number of lending institutions. Formal credit lines may be subject to compensating balance and/or
fee requirements and will therefore be used only when an Applicant determines that such a credit line offers advantages
as compared with other available credit options. Compensating balance requirements will not exceed 5% of the committed
credit line amount, and fees will not exceed 0.30% per annum. Each Applicant participating in a credit line would be
able to draw funds to the exclusion of the other Applicants. The Applicants may change their credit lines and may obtain
additional lines over time. The continued availability of such credit lines is subject to the continuing review of
the lending institutions. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In addition, the Applicants (other than North Atlantic, HEC and Quinnehtuk) propose to issue Short-Term Notes pursuant
to such formal and formal lines of credit. Short-Term Notes will be issued both on a transactional basis, with a separate
note evidencing each loan, and on a so-called grid note (``Grid Note'') basis, as described below. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Each Short-Term Note issued on transactional basis will be dated the date of issue, will have a maximum term of 270 days,
and will bear interest at a fixed or floating rate. Such Short-Term Notes will be issued no later than December 31, 1996,
and will (except as described below) be subject to prepayment at any time at the borrower's option. From time-to-time,
an Applicant may use a different form of Short-Term Note containing customary terms to evidence its borrowings, if
necessary, to satisfy the needs of a particular lender. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Short-Term Notes issued on a Grid Note basis will be issued by an Applicant to a particular lending institution at or
prior to the first borrowing under the Grid Note from that lender by the Applicant. Each repayment and reborrowing
subsequent to the first borrowing will be recorded on a schedule to the note without the necessity of issuing additional
notes. Also recorded on a schedule to the note at the time of a borrowing will be the date of the borrowing, the maturity
(which may not exceed 270 days from the date of the borrowing), the number of days the borrowing is outstanding, the
interest rate or method of determining the interest rate, the amount of interest due, and the date of payment. Except
as described below, borrowings on a Grid Note basis will be subject to prepayment at any time at the borrower's option.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The interest rate on all Short-Term Notes will be determined on the basis of competitive quotations from several lending
institutions, and will either be at a fixed interest rate or at a floating interest rate determined with reference
to an agreed-upon index (such as a Lending institution's prime rate, the London InterBank Offered Rate, certificate
of deposit rates, money market rates or commercial paper rates). The interest rate in any case will not exceed two percentage
points above the Federal Funds Effective Rate. The Applicants will select the lending institution(s) from which
to make a particular short-term borrowing and determine whether to borrow at a fixed or a floating rate on the basis
of the lowest expected effective interest cost for borrowings of comparable sizes and maturities. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Borrowings bearing floating interest rates will generally be subject to prepayment at the borrower's option. The
Applicants believe that many lending institutions lending funds at fixed interest rates are engaged in ``matched
funding,'' i.e., such lenders acquire for comparable maturities the funds that are lent to their borrowers. Because
the lenders would remain obligated under their own borrowings from others if the Applicants were to prepay their borrowings
in advance of their scheduled maturities, many lending institutions lending funds at fixed interest rates stipulate
that such borrowings may not be prepaid or may be prepaid only with a premium that will make the lender whole for any losses
(including lost profits) it may incur. Accordingly, in order to realize the benefits of fixed interest rates when
a fixed-rate borrowing is evaluated to be the lowest cost borrowing available, the Applicants may from time to time
agree with individual lenders that such borrowings may not be prepaid or may only be prepaid if the lender is made whole
for its losses.

CL&amp;P, WMECO and Northeast request authority to continue to sell Commercial Paper publicly. Such Commercial
Paper will be issued through the Depository Trust Company in the form of book entry notes in denominations of not less
than $50,000, of varying maturities, with no maturity more than 270 days after the date of issue. The Commercial Paper
will not be repayable prior to maturity. The Commercial Paper will be sold through a placement agent or agents in a co-managed
commercial paper program pursuant to a placement agent agreement at either the discount rate per annum or the interest
rate per annum prevailing at the date of issuance for commercial paper of comparable quality and of the particular
maturity sold by public utility issuers thereof. No Commercial Paper will be issued unless the issuing Applicant
believes that the effective interest cost to the Applicant will be equal to or less than the effective interest rate
at which the applicant could issue Short-Term Notes in an amount at least equal to the principal amount of such Commercial
Paper. The placement agent or agents will receive a commission for the sale of the Commercial Paper of not more than
1/8 of 1% per annum, on a discounted basis.

Except as otherwise described herein and unless otherwise authorized by the Commission, any short-term borrowings
of the Applicants outstanding at December 31, 1996 will either be repaid from internal cash resources or from the proceeds
of long-term debt or equity financing or remain outstanding if the Commission authorizes the Applicants to continue
such short-term borrowings after December 31, 1996.
