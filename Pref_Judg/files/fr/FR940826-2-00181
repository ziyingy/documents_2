SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
This notice amends the FY 94 NOFA for Indian Applicants under the HOME Program (59 FR 11424; March 10, 1994) at section
I.(e)(4)(iii)(C), which deals with the selection criteria pertaining to environmental review. The amendment is
made to reflect changes resulting from The Multifamily Housing Property Disposition Reform Act of 1994 (MHPDR ACT)
(Pub. L. 102&hyph;233, approved April 11, 1994). The changes involve removing the requirement that after rating
and ranking but before selection for award, HUD Field ONAPs will perform an environmental review of applications
in accordance with 24 CFR part 50, and that applications may be reranked or disqualified on the basis of the environmental
review. These provisions are replaced with the provision that after rating and ranking, applicants with the highest
scores will be selected and offered awards. The grantee must assume responsibility for completing the environmental
review of the project under 24 CFR part 58. In accordance with 24 CFR part 58, until the grantee completes its environmental
review and obtains a release of funds from HUD, the grantee may not commit HOME funds to activities (unless the activities
are exempt from review under 24 CFR part 58), or expend any other funds for activities unless they are exempt or would
not have an adverse environmental impact or limit the choice of reasonable alternatives. However, a grantee may expend
HOME or other funds on environmental reviews, exempt under 24 CFR part 58, before obtaining a release of funds to be
used for non-exempt purposes from HUD.

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
This notice adds a new paragraph I.(e)(4)(iii)(E) which clarifies that unsuccessful applicants may notify the ONAP,
within 90 days of being informed of their score, of computational errors in the rating and ranking. This paragraph
provides for the correction of such errors in rating and ranking and, if the error denied funding of the applicant,
provides for funding the application in subsequent funding cycles. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
This notice also amends Appendix 1 of the FY 1994 Indian Home Program NOFA by including a new address for the Denver Office
of Native American Programs. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Accordingly, the following modifications are made in FR Doc. 94&hyph;5535 to the NOFA titled, ``NOFA For Fiscal Year
1994 For Indian Applicants Under The HOME Program'', published on March 10, 1994 (59 FR 11424):

1. On page 11429, paragraph I.(e)(4)(iii)(C), which appears in the first column, is revised to read as follows: 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

(C) 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Selection.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 The ranking process will produce an ordered list of projects that may receive funding. The order is established by
the number of points the project received in the rating process. The eligibility requirement for further consideration
will be 50 out of 100 points. Project applications scoring lower than 50 points will be set aside as non-responsive
and ineligible. After rating and ranking, applicants with the highest scores will be selected and offered awards.
The grantee must assume responsibility for completing the environmental review of the project under 24 CFR part 58.
In accordance with 24 CFR part 58, until the grantee completes its environmental review and obtains a release of funds
from HUD, the grantee may not commit HOME funds to activities (unless the activities are exempt from review under 24
CFR part 58), or expend any other funds for activities unless they are exempt or would not have an adverse environmental
impact or limit the choice of reasonable alternatives. Environmental studies are exempt under 24 CFR part 58 and therefore
a grantee may expend HOME or other funds on environmental reviews before obtaining a release of funds to be used for
non-exempt purposes from HUD. For the purposes of geographic diversity, HUD may award at least one grant to each of
the areas covered by the Offices of Indian Programs listed in Appendix 1.

Errors in rating and ranking.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 Applicants may bring computational errors in the rating and ranking of applications to the attention of ONAP within
90 days of being informed of their score. If an ONAP review determines that there was a computational error that denied
funding to the applicant, the applicant will be funded out of remaining funds in the challenged round of funding, or
out of the next available round of funding.
