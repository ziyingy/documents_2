 One respondent suggested that a definition of substandard be included. One respondent asked if FmHA intends to prepare
and distribute special tabulations of substandard units by its definition, by occupancy, tenure, income, and household
size. Several respondents expressed objection to FmHA not considering elderly homeowners as a basis of need. Several
respondents objected to the 20 percent ceiling on substandard units which FmHA will accept in the determination of
need. One respondent raised the question of who is responsible for determining if the analyst is qualified and what
the qualifications are for preparing a study. That person also wanted to know if the study is incomplete, is the preapplication
determined incomplete and returned to the applicant. Two respondents felt that requiring the market analyst to make
an on-site visit was a significant improvement in this exhibit. One respondent suggested that the exhibit be used
as a guide only and not mandated. One respondent asked if FmHA intended to exclude rentoverburden households from
rentup demand estimates. That respondent also expressed an opinion that the listing of small businesses in the Site
section of the exhibit would be construed to mean those businesses must be available in order for a community to be considered
eligible for FmHA financing. Other comments and suggestions offered on the technical content of the exhibit are too
numerous to list here.

 A definition for substandard has been included. HUD furnished FmHA with information pertaining to occupancy in substandard
units based on the 1980 census. That information was disseminated to our field staff for distribution to market analysts.
We are in the process of coordinating with HUD to obtain this same data when it becomes available. (See discussion of
elderly homeowners under Exhibit A&hyph;7, Paragraph II.A. and a discussion of substandard housing under Exhibit
A&hyph;7, Paragraph II.A). The qualifications of a market analyst and the responsibility for determining whether
an analyst is qualified are iterated in Exhibit A&hyph;7 of this instruction. If a market study is incomplete, the
applicant may furnish additional information to complement the market study without the necessity of returning
the entire preapplication. This will inevitably delay the processing of the preapplication. The requirement that
a market analyst visit the site of the proposed project was not introduced with this revision; it has always been a requirement.
The purpose of the exhibit is to require enough information on which a feasibility decision can be based and to establish
uniformity in the content of studies. Prior to FmHA issuing the exhibit, the market studies varied greatly and all
did not contain the most basic types of information. We have seen a marked improvement in the studies because of the
issuance of the exhibit. While FmHA originally allowed applicants to consider the exhibit as a guideline, we did not
feel it prudent to continue this practice. The exhibit is, therefore, required in order for the study to be acceptable
to the Agency; market studies which do not contain Exhibit A&hyph;8 requirements will not be acceptable. We understand
that the HUD information on rentoverburdened households is not yet available. In the interim, language has been added
to the exhibit which invites the analyst to include this type of information where available. While this exhibit is
not the proper vehicle for establishing policies concerning required community services and facilities, the Site
section has been reworded to state that the businesses listed are an example of the types of business which may be located
in the community.

Many of the proposed changes are based on comments and recommendations submitted from market analysts over the past
two years. Market analysts have expressed differing opinions concerning the content of this exhibit. We have considered
all of these differing opinions and have amended the exhibit to include what we consider a rational and understandable
basis for a market study. We have attempted to correct the original exhibit requirements where it lacked sufficient
statistics to make a determination for elderly and congregate projects. Other changes made to the exhibit will standardize
the types of information market studies will contain and provide the uniformity heretofore missing. We have considered
all comments and the exhibit now reflects those changes which FmHA has determined appropriate for inclusion.
