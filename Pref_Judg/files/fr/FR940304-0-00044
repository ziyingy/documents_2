 Ancillary diagnostic services, which are coded beginning with a ``V,'' are provided in laboratories and radiology
offices if the patient's main reason for the visit is to get an x-ray, (V72.5, Radiological examination, not elsewhere
classified), or to have a test conducted (V72.6, Laboratory examination.) The condition for which the patient sought
treatment will be reflected in the additional diagnoses. In coding ancillary diagnostic services, it may be helpful
to question the reason for the encounter. The reason for the encounter is that the patient visited the laboratory or
radiology office to have either an analysis performed or an x-ray taken.

 One commenter stated that HCFA's estimate that 70 percent of physicians and office staff will need ICD&hyph;9&hyph;CM
coding training is a gross underestimate.

 We do not believe that our estimate of 70 percent of physicians and office staff in need of coding training was too low.
In fact, we believe that most physicians and office staff did not require coding training. Immediately after implementation
of the diagnostic coding requirement, medical review at the intermediary level did not reveal significant coding
problems. Since that time, the majority of physician bills using ICD&hyph;9&hyph;CM coding have passed intermediary
edits for accuracy. In addition, many physicians did not need training since they submitted ICD&hyph;9&hyph;CM
codes prior to April 1989 due to the requirements of third party payers for non-Medicare patients. We believe that
the lack of coding problems indicates that, if anything, we may have overestimated the proportion of physicians and
office staff that needed training.

 One commenter suggested that HCFA require the Medicare carriers to provide ICD&hyph;9&hyph;CM training and technical
assistance to physicians and providers.

 The Medicare carriers were required by HCFA to provide initial ICD&hyph;9&hyph;CM coding training prior to the April
1, 1989 implementation date. A National Carriers Training program was held in February 1989 in preparation for the
training done in each State by each carrier. The National Carriers Training was conducted by AHIMA, with input on the
program from the AMA. Subsequently, each carrier was responsible for conducting its own training program on a state-by-state
basis. In many cases, carriers worked with the State medical societies in conducting the training. Diagnostic coding
training for physicians and physician office staffs has been ongoing since the implementation of this requirement,
especially through courses and sessions sponsored by the private sector. For further information concerning coding
training, physicians can contact their State medical society, the AMA, AHIMA, their State component of the medical
record or medical health information association, or their carrier.

 One commenter indicated that the sanction provisions for noncompliance with the coding requirements are illogical
since coding bills or requesting payment with ICD&hyph;9&hyph;CM codes is essentially a clerical function. The
civil monetary penalties and sanction actions by the Office of Inspector General are perceived as excessive since
clerical errors of omission and inaccurately coded diagnoses will be inevitable. Another commenter recommended
that the sanctions process should not apply to the ICD&hyph;9&hyph;CM coding requirement.

 Coding is a task routinely delegated by physicians to billing clerks or staff. However, this delegation does not relieve
the physician of the responsibility to submit bills or requests for payment that meet the requirements of the law.

 One medical association questioned whether the carrier considers the remarks on the explanation of the Medicare
benefit (EOMB) form an advisement of a violation (for not including diagnostic coding on a bill or request for payment)
that will be referred to the OIG for investigation and possible sanctions. The commenter asked why the carrier includes
a remark in the EOMB stating that they will process this claim but will not process future claims. The association suggests
that the message on the EOMB should contain a more complete and accurate statement.

 Messages that appear on the EOMB have been revised and are more clear and explanatory. It is not our intent to put the
beneficiary at risk by not paying a bill or request for payment lacking an ICD&hyph;9&hyph;CM code. For claims submitted
by physicians who do not accept assignment, the carrier will process the bill or request for payment as usual, substituting
a ``dummy'' code for the ICD&hyph;9&hyph;CM coding. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The carrier will collect physician-specific information about the quantity of the dummy codes generated per physician.
When a threshold of ten bills or requests for payment is reached, the carrier is instructed to contact the physician
in order to explain the necessity of providing diagnostic coding and to help with training. If the physician subsequently
knowingly, willfully, and in repeated cases fails to supply the requested codes, the Office of the Inspector General
may invoke a civil money penalty.
