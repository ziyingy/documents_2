EPA's estimate of available capacity takes into account capacity that will be required for Phase I wastes that were
granted a national capacity variance, ignitable and corrosive wastes whose treatment standards were vacated (58
FR 29860, May 24, 1993), waste characteristics that affect the ability for a particular facility(s) to treat the wastes,
and other factors that may limit capacity.

EPA is also considering the capacity effects of recent court decisions regarding the regulation of hazardous constituents
other than those for which the waste fails the TC test. EPA solicited comments on the treatment capacity effects of
requiring facilities to treat the underlying hazardous constituents in TC organic hazardous wastes to meet the then-proposed
universal treatment standards. Although several commenters submitted comments in support of or in opposition to
requirements for treatment of underlying hazardous constituents, few comments were received on the specific issue
of the effects of this requirement on treatment capacity. EPA has concluded that sufficient combustion capacity
exists to treat underlying hazardous organic constituents. One commenter indicated that few facilities could achieve
the universal treatment standards (UTS) for some metals (which may be present as underlying constituents) in incinerator
ash without further treatment. However, EPA believes that stabilization should generally be able to achieve the
UTS levels for metal underlying constituents present in residuals from the treatment of organic TC wastes.

Stabilization Capacity
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
. Stabilization may be required to treat the residuals of wastes covered in today's rule that contain metal underlying
constituents. EPA estimates that over 1 million tons of stabilization capacity is currently available. In analyzing
alternative treatment capacity for stabilization of newly identified and listed wastes, the Agency built on the
capacity analysis conducted for the Third Third LDR rule. This analysis was based on data contained in the TSDR Capacity
Data Set.

Innovative (Non-combustion) Technologies
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
. There are several non-combustion technologies for the treatment of soil contaminated with RCRA hazardous wastes,
including hydrolysis, vacuum extraction, photolysis, and oxidation. To the extent that these technologies can
be used to treat hazardous soil on-site, the required capacity for combustion will decrease.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
EPA has limited information on innovative technologies with regard to both available capacity and to limitations
of the technologies or constraints on the use of these technologies. EPA solicited comments on the use of innovative
technologies for the treatment of soil contaminated with RCRA hazardous wastes. Specifically, EPA requested information
regarding constraints on the use of these technologies both on- and off-site, including physical or chemical characteristics
of the soils, and logistical constraints such as permitting and scheduling. EPA also solicited data on volumes of
contaminated soil currently being treated by these technologies, current available capacity, and estimates of
future capacity. EPA received two comments regarding innovative technologies. One commenter noted that to treat
soil on-site requires permitting and approval by local, state, and federal agencies, which may be a problem for some
innovative technologies. Another commenter stated that the chemical concentration to which a soil can be biotreated
is influenced by the particular chemical, the soil type, the age of the contaminated media, and the bioremediation
process. EPA encourages the use of innovative technologies when feasible, and realizes that_in some cases_use of
these technologies may be limited by technical and non-technical considerations. Sufficient conventional treatment
capacity is available, however, such that these limitations do not affect capacity determinations.

The Agency is promulgating treatment standards for TC organic nonwastewaters based primarily on incineration performance
data. Treatment standards for some newly identified organic TC wastewaters are also being promulgated in today's
rule. (Organic TC wastewaters managed in systems regulated under the CWA, those injected into Class I injection wells
as regulated under the SDWA, and those zero discharge facilities that engage in CWA-equivalent treatment prior to
land disposal will be addressed in future rulemakings. EPA will make variance determinations for these wastes at
that time.) For the proposed rule, the Agency did not have data indicating that facilities managing organic TC wastewaters
would be impacted. Thus, EPA solicited comments in the proposed rule on the quantities of newly identified organic
TC wastewaters affected by the rule. However, no comments were received on this issue. The Agency has concluded that
facilities managing organic TC wastewaters will not be affected by this rule (i.e., no organic TC wastewaters will
likely require alternative commercial treatment as a result of today's rule).

EPA developed estimates of the quantities of newly identified TC organic wastes based on current management options
to comply with the LDR requirements. EPA did not receive any data in public comments on the quantities of organic TC
nonwastewaters containing underlying metal constituents. EPA estimates that approximately 220,000 tons of organic
TC nonwastewaters are subject to this rule. (See Table 2 which presents the quantities of TC nonwastewaters (except
for liquid nonwastewaters) requiring off-site treatment by waste code.) Even if all this quantity contained underlying
metal constituents, the residuals from the treatment of organics could not be higher than 220,000 tons. Underlying
metal constituents are, by definition, at levels that are below TC levels for metals. Stabilization is an appropriate
technology for treating low level metal wastes. Given that ample treatment capacity exists for stabilization (over
1 million tons), EPA believes that sufficient treatment capacity exists for residuals of organic TC wastes containing
underlying metal constituents.
