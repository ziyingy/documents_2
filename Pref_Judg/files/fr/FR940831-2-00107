I. Background
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Pursuant to Public Law 97-415, the U.S. Nuclear Regulatory Commission (the Commission or NRC staff) is publishing
this regular biweekly notice. Public Law 97-415 revised section 189 of the Atomic Energy Act of 1954, as amended (the
Act), to require the Commission to publish notice of any amendments issued, or proposed to be issued, under a new provision
of section 189 of the Act. This provision grants the Commission the authority to issue and make immediately effective
any amendment to an operating license upon a determination by the Commission that such amendment involves no significant
hazards consideration, notwithstanding the pendency before the Commission of a request for a hearing from any person.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
This biweekly notice includes all notices of amendments issued, or proposed to be issued from August 8, 1994, through
August 19, 1994. The last biweekly notice was published on August 17, 1994 (59 FR 42332).

Notice Of Consideration Of Issuance Of Amendments To Facility Operating Licenses, Proposed No Significant Hazards
Consideration Determination, And Opportunity For A Hearing
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The Commission has made a proposed determination that the following amendment requests involve no significant hazards
consideration. Under the Commission's regulations in 10 CFR 50.92, this means that operation of the facility in accordance
with the proposed amendment would not (1) involve a significant increase in the probability or consequences of an
accident previously evaluated; or (2) create the possibility of a new or different kind of accident from any accident
previously evaluated; or (3) involve a significant reduction in a margin of safety. The basis for this proposed determination
for each amendment request is shown below. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Commission is seeking public comments on this proposed determination. Any comments received within 30 days after
the date of publication of this notice will be considered in making any final determination. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Normally, the Commission will not issue the amendment until the expiration of the 30-day notice period. However,
should circumstances change during the notice period such that failure to act in a timely way would result, for example,
in derating or shutdown of the facility, the Commission may issue the license amendment before the expiration of the
30-day notice period, provided that its final determination is that the amendment involves no significant hazards
consideration. The final determination will consider all public and State comments received before action is taken.
Should the Commission take this action, it will publish in the 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 -->
Federal Register 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
a notice of issuance and provide for opportunity for a hearing after issuance. The Commission expects that the need
to take this action will occur very infrequently. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Written comments may be submitted by mail to the Rules Review and Directives Branch, Division of Freedom of Information
and Publications Services, Office of Administration, U.S. Nuclear Regulatory Commission, Washington, DC 20555,
and should cite the publication date and page number of this 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 -->
Federal Register 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
notice. Written comments may also be delivered to Room 6D22, Two White Flint North, 11545 Rockville Pike, Rockville,
Maryland from 7:30 a.m. to 4:15 p.m. Federal workdays. Copies of written comments received may be examined at the NRC
Public Document Room, the Gelman Building, 2120 L Street, NW., Washington, DC 20555. The filing of requests for a hearing
and petitions for leave to intervene is discussed below.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
By September 30, 1994, the licensee may file a request for a hearing with respect to issuance of the amendment to the
subject facility operating license and any person whose interest may be affected by this proceeding and who wishes
to participate as a party in the proceeding must file a written request for a hearing and a petition for leave to intervene.
Requests for a hearing and a petition for leave to intervene shall be filed in accordance with the Commission's ``Rules
of Practice for Domestic Licensing Proceedings'' in 10 CFR Part 2. Interested persons should consult a current copy
of 10 CFR 2.714 which is available at the Commission's Public Document Room, the Gelman Building, 2120 L Street, NW.,
Washington, DC 20555 and at the local public document room for the particular facility involved. If a request for a
hearing or petition for leave to intervene is filed by the above date, the Commission or an Atomic Safety and Licensing
Board, designated by the Commission or by the Chairman of the Atomic Safety and Licensing Board Panel, will rule on
the request and/or petition; and the Secretary or the designated Atomic Safety and Licensing Board will issue a notice
of a hearing or an appropriate order. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
As required by 10 CFR 2.714, a petition for leave to intervene shall set forth with particularity the interest of the
petitioner in the proceeding, and how that interest may be affected by the results of the proceeding. The petition
should specifically explain the reasons why intervention should be permitted with particular reference to the following
factors: (1) the nature of the petitioner's right under the Act to be made a party to the proceeding; (2) the nature and
extent of the petitioner's property, financial, or other interest in the proceeding; and (3) the possible effect
of any order which may be entered in the proceeding on the petitioner's interest. The petition should also identify
the specific aspect(s) of the subject matter of the proceeding as to which petitioner wishes to intervene. Any person
who has filed a petition for leave to intervene or who has been admitted as a party may amend the petition without requesting
leave of the Board up to 15 days prior to the first prehearing conference scheduled in the proceeding, but such an amended
petition must satisfy the specificity requirements described above.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Not later than 15 days prior to the first prehearing conference scheduled in the proceeding, a petitioner shall file
a supplement to the petition to intervene which must include a list of the contentions which are sought to be litigated
in the matter. Each contention must consist of a specific statement of the issue of law or fact to be raised or controverted.
In addition, the petitioner shall provide a brief explanation of the bases of the contention and a concise statement
of the alleged facts or expert opinion which support the contention and on which the petitioner intends to rely in proving
the contention at the hearing. The petitioner must also provide references to those specific sources and documents
of which the petitioner is aware and on which the petitioner intends to rely to establish those facts or expert opinion.
Petitioner must provide sufficient information to show that a genuine dispute exists with the applicant on a material
issue of law or fact. Contentions shall be limited to matters within the scope of the amendment under consideration.
The contention must be one which, if proven, would entitle the petitioner to relief. A petitioner who fails to file
such a supplement which satisfies these requirements with respect to at least one contention will not be permitted
to participate as a party. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Those permitted to intervene become parties to the proceeding, subject to any limitations in the order granting leave
to intervene, and have the opportunity to participate fully in the conduct of the hearing, including the opportunity
to present evidence and cross-examine witnesses. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
If a hearing is requested, the Commission will make a final determination on the issue of no significant hazards consideration.
The final determination will serve to decide when the hearing is held. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
If the final determination is that the amendment request involves no significant hazards consideration, the Commission
may issue the amendment and make it immediately effective, notwithstanding the request for a hearing. Any hearing
held would take place after issuance of the amendment. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
If the final determination is that the amendment request involves a significant hazards consideration, any hearing
held would take place before the issuance of any amendment. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
A request for a hearing or a petition for leave to intervene must be filed with the Secretary of the Commission, U.S.
Nuclear Regulatory Commission, Washington, DC 20555, Attention: Docketing and Services Branch, or may be delivered
to the Commission's Public Document Room, the Gelman Building, 2120 L Street, NW., Washington DC 20555, by the above
date. Where petitions are filed during the last 10 days of the notice period, it is requested that the petitioner promptly
so inform the Commission by a toll-free telephone call to Western Union at 1-(800) 248-5100 (in Missouri 1-(800) 342-6700).
The Western Union operator should be given Datagram Identification Number N1023 and the following message addressed
to

notice. A copy of the petition should also be sent to the Office of the General Counsel, U.S. Nuclear Regulatory Commission,
Washington, DC 20555, and to the attorney for the licensee. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Nontimely filings of petitions for leave to intervene, amended petitions, supplemental petitions and/or requests
for a hearing will not be entertained absent a determination by the Commission, the presiding officer or the Atomic
Safety and Licensing Board that the petition and/or request should be granted based upon a balancing of factors specified
in 10 CFR 2.714(a)(1)(i)-(v) and 2.714(d).

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The proposed amendment would increase the allowed out-of-service time to increase from 7 days to 14 days for the automatic
depressurization system (ADS), the high pressure coolant injection (HPCI) system and the reactor core isolation
cooling (RCIC)
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

Amendment 149, issued September 28, 1993.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Basis for proposed no significant hazards consideration determination: 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
As required by 10 CFR 50.91(a), the licensee has provided its analysis of the issue of no significant hazards consideration,
which is presented below:
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->
1. The Operation of Pilgrim Station in accordance with the proposed amendment will not involve a significant increase
in the probability or consequences of an accident previously evaluated.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Safety criteria used to determine the acceptability of extending continued operation with one ADS valve, the HPCI
or RCIC system out-of-service (OOS) is consistent with Pilgrim's licensing basis. For example, events with the expected
frequency of occurrence greater than once-per-reactor lifetime are required to meet the transient MCPR [minimum
critical power ratio] thermal limit: more than 99.9% of the fuel rods are expected to avoid boiling transition. Very
low probability events, such as a LOCA [loss-of-coolant accident], are required to satisfy the criteria of 10CFR50.46:
the primary criterion being that the Peak Cladding Temperatures (PCT) be maintained less than 2200
<!-- PJG 0017 degreeslatlong -->
&cir;F.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
For intermediate frequency events, e.g. safe shutdown in the event of a fire, 10CFR50 Appendix R involves a ``no fuel
damage'' criterion. To evaluate these types of events, the GE [General Electric] SAFER/GESTR-LOCA licensing methodology
was used to calculate the system responses and PCTs.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Analyses performed by Pilgrim's NSSS [nuclear steam supply system] vendor, General Electric, [***] for various
limiting-case scenarios involving ADS, HPCI, or RCIC out-of-service situations demonstrated 10CFR50.46 limits
(i.e. a PCT less than 2200
<!-- PJG 0017 degreeslatlong -->
&cir;F) were met. (The most severe PCT was 1500
<!-- PJG 0017 degreeslatlong -->
&cir;F). The core damage frequency analysis for Pilgrim is unchanged by operating Pilgrim in accordance with this
proposed amendment. The 14 day OOS for HPCI, RCIC and ADS also conforms to the 00S time for these systems found in BWR
[boiling-water reactor] Standard Technical Specifications. Hence, increasing the allowed 00S time from 7 to 14
days does not result in a challenge to fuel cladding integrity or BWR Standard Technical Specifications, and operating
Pilgrim in accordance with the proposed amendment will not involve a significant increase in the probability or consequences
of an accident previously evaluated.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The removal of the association between LPCI [low-pressure coolant injection] and Core Spray system testing and surveilling
their filled discharge pipes is an administrative change because the specified surveillance frequency is unchanged.
This proposed change reflects Amendment #149, issued by the NRC September 28, 1993, and is proposed to ensure consistency
between Pilgrim's Technical Specification sections. This administrative change will not involve a significant
increase in the probability or consequences of an accident previously evaluated.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
2. The operation of Pilgrim Station in accordance with the proposed amendment will not create the possibility of a
new or different kind of accident from any accident previously evaluated.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
As discussed above, a variety of limiting-case scenarios were analyzed to demonstrate the effects of increasing
the 00S time for one ADS valve, the HPCI system, or the RCIC system. The conclusion of the analyses is that this proposed
change does not violate Pilgrim's licensing basis or 10CFR50.46 requirements. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Some scenarios result in elevated PCTs, but they are still significantly below the 10CFR50.46 limit of 2200
<!-- PJG 0017 degreeslatlong -->
&cir;F. Therefore, since the licensing-basis and code required PCT continues to be met and because the proposed change
comports the requirements of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
BWR Standard Technical Specifications, operating Pilgrim in
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
accordance with the proposed amendment will not create the possibility of a new or different kind of accident from
any accident previously evaluated. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
As discussed in above question 1, the proposed change to section 4.5.H.1 is administrative and does not create the
possibility of a new or different kind of accident from any accident previously evaluated.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
3. The operation of Pilgrim Station in accordance with the proposed amendment will not involve a significant reduction
in a margin of safety.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Certain scenarios analyzed for system unavailability result in evaluated PCTs. However, these elevated PCTs are
significantly below the 10CFR50.46 limit of 2200
<!-- PJG 0017 degreeslatlong -->
&cir;F. Therefore, there is no reduction in the safety margin for PCT resulting from the change from 7 to 14 days. The
proposed change also corresponds to the requirements of BWR Standard Technical Specifications concerning 00S for
HPCI, RCIC and ADS. Therefore, operating Pilgrim Station in accordance with this proposed amendment does not involve
a significant reduction in a margin of safety.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The proposed amendment would implement a performance based assessment program, including corresponding organizational
and functional changes. Specifically, the changes affect the Independent Review (IR) function, the independent
assessment of plant activity and the Independent Safety Engineering Group. These functions will be performed by
the proposed Nuclear Assessment Section (NAS). The NAS would perform internal evaluations and assessment activities
and serve as plant management's staff for the objective oversight of plant performance relating to nuclear safety,
reliability, and quality. The NAS's fundamental role will be to: (1) assist plant management in the early identification
of issues which may prevent the plant from achieving quality performance on a sustained basis; and (2) ensure effective
correction of deficiencies.

Description of amendment request: 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The proposed amendment would change TS Sections 5.3.1.3, 5.4.2.1, 5.4.22, and the Section 5 references to allow the
use of fuel enriched to 4.95 plus 0.05 weight percent (w/o) U235.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The proposed license change is required to support delivery of reload batch enrichments anticipated for Cycle 17
and beyond. These reloads will require the use of fuel enrichments exceeding the current TS limit of 4.20 plus 0.05
weight percent (w/o) U

Basis for proposed no significant hazards consideration determination: 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
As required by 10 CFR 50.91(a), the licensee has provided its analysis of the issue of no significant hazards consideration,
which is presented below:
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->
1. The proposed amendment does not involve a significant increase in the probability or consequences of an accident
previously evaluated. Increasing the allowable U
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=5 f=2 -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->
 enrichment will have no influence on the probability of an accident previously evaluated. No changes will be made
to any safety related equipment, systems, or setpoints used in determining the probability of an evaluated accident.
Neither will the proposed amendment allow operation of the facility or safety equipment outside applicable limitations
or restrictions. Plant design bases will not be altered. With respect to the Fuel Handling Accident, the manner in
which the fuel is handled will not be altered. The heat load on the Spent Fuel Pool will not be increased and the cooling
and circulation systems and equipment will be unaltered. Therefore, there will be no significant increase in the
probability of an accident previously evaluated.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The proposed change does not increase maximum allowable burnup or fission product inventory. Since fission product
inventory is an inconsequential function of enrichment, radiological consequences evaluated in the Updated Final
Safety Analysis Report (UFSAR) will not increase. The proposed change will not alter the function of safety related
equipment designed to mitigate the consequences of an accident previously evaluated or allow operation of the facility
outside applicable limitations or restrictions. Accordingly the proposed change will not involve a significant
increase in the consequences of an accident previously evaluated.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
2. The proposed amendment does not create the possibility of a new or different kind of accident from any accident previously
evaluated. The proposed increase in allowable enrichment will not result in any design, operation, or function changes
to any safety related equipment designed to prevent and/or mitigate accidents, to any setpoints or systems, or to
any portion of the plant design basis. Operation of the facility will remain within all required limitations and restrictions.
With respect to the Fuel Handling Accident, the manner in which the fuel is handled will not be altered. The heat load
on the Spent Fuel Pool will not be increased and the cooling and circulation systems and equipment will be unaltered.
Therefore, the proposed changes do not create the possibility of a new or different kind of accident from any accident
previously evaluated.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
3. The proposed amendment does not involve a significant reduction in the margin of safety. NRC acceptance criteria
and thus the acceptable margin of safety to criticality for the Spent Fuel Pool and New Fuel Storage Vault criticality
are defined in Section 5.0 of the Technical Specifications. For the Spent Fuel Pool the criteria specify that Keff
must be maintained less than 0.95 when the pit is flooded with unborated water. For the New Fuel Storage Vault, the Keff
must remain less than 0.95 if the vault is flooded with unborated water, and must remain below 0.98 in an optimum moderation
event. Analyses performed in support of the proposed change demonstrate that these acceptance criteria will continue
to be met. With respect to radiological consequences, the margin of safety is defined by 10 CFR [Part] 100 limits which
will not be challenged. The analyses conclude that fission product inventory and thus radiological consequences
reported in Chapter 15 of the UFSAR will not change. Accordingly the proposed license amendment will not involve a
significant reduction in the margin of safety.

The amendment would allow operation of the plant with one Emergency Diesel Generator (EDG) inoperable without entering
a condition prohibited by Section 3.0 of the Technical Specifications (TS). This TS request includes provisions
to avoid testing the operable EDG altogether under certain conditions to ensure that one EDG is available to provide
emergency power, if needed, and to preserve the EDG overall life and reliability.

As required by 10 CFR 50.91(a), the licensee has provided its analysis of the issue of no significant hazards consideration,
which is presented below:
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->
1. The proposed amendment does not involve a significant increase in the probability or consequences of an accident
previously evaluated. The proposed change involves changes in the testing frequency of the EDGs when one EDG is inoperable,
as well as provision of additional measures to ensure that a source of off-site power is available. The proposed change
will also avoid testing of an EDG when one EDG is inoperable if the EDG became inoperable for reasons other than a common
cause. Since the changes involve the EDGs which perform an accident mitigation function and are not involved in any
accident initiation sequence, there is no significant increase in the probability of a previously analyzed accident.
Since the changes involve the EDGs which perform an accident mitigation function, and the changes provide additional
assurance that emergency power will be available for accident mitigation, [there] is no significant increase in
the consequences of a previously analyzed accident. Therefore, there would be no increase in the probability or consequences
of an accident previously evaluated.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
2. The proposed amendment does not create the possibility of a new or different kind of accident from any accident previously
evaluated. The proposed change involves changes in the testing frequency of the EDGs when one EDG is inoperable, as
well as provision of additional measures to ensure that a source of off-site power is available. The proposed change
will also avoid testing of an EDG when one EDG is inoperable if the EDG became inoperable for reasons other than a common
cause. Since these changes do not involve changes in the operation of the plant, or physical or equipment changes and
involve controls for accident mitigation equipment, the proposed amendment will not created the possibility of
new or different kind of accident from any accident previously evaluated. Therefore, the proposed changes do not
create the possibility of a new or different kind of accident from any accident previously evaluated.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
3. The proposed amendment does not involve a significant reduction in the margin of safety. The proposed change involves
changes in the testing frequency of the EDGs when one EDG is inoperable, as well as provision of additional measures
to ensure that a source of off-site power is available. The proposed change will also avoid testing of an EDG when one
EDG is inoperable if the EDG became inoperable for reasons other than a common cause. The change reduces the required
testing frequency of an operable EDG, hence reducing time that no EDG will be available for automatic starting and
loading. These changes will provide assurance that emergency power will be available to mitigate the effects of any
accident and will prevent excessive wear on the EDGs. Therefore, the proposed changes do not involve a significant
reduction in a margin of safety.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->
The change does not involve a significant hazards consideration for the following reasons:
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
1. The proposed amendment does not involve a significant increase in the probability or consequences of an accident
previously evaluated because it is a programmatic and administrative change which does not physically alter any
safety-related systems, nor does it affect the way in which any safety-related systems perform their functions.
Since the design of the facility and system operating parameters are not changing, the proposed amendment does not
involve an increase in the probability or consequences of any accident previously evaluated.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
2. The proposed amendment does not create the possibility of a new or different kind of accident from any accident previously
evaluated. As stated in Item 1, the proposed amendment is a programmatic and administrative change which does not
physically alter any safety-related systems; nor does it affect the way in which any safety-related systems perform
their functions. Since the design of the facility and system operating parameters are not changing, the proposed
amendment does not create the possibility of a new or different kind of accident from any accident previously evaluated.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
3. The proposed amendment does not involve a significant reduction in the margin of safety because it is a programmatic
and administrative change which provides assurance that plant operations continue to be conducted in a safe manner
through the performance based assessment programs. As stated in Item 1, the proposed amendment does not physically
alter any safety-related systems; nor does it affect the way in which any safety-related systems perform their functions.
Since the design of the facility and system operating parameters are not changing, the proposed amendment does not
involve a significant reduction in the margin of safety.

which is presented below:
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->
1. The proposed change does not involve a significant increase in the probability or consequences of an accident previously
evaluated. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Consistent with Regulatory Guide (RG) 1.121, ``Basis for Plugging Degraded PWR Steam Generator Tubes, '' Revision
0, August 1976, the traditional depth-based criteria for SG tube repair implicitly ensures that tubes accepted for
continued service will retain adequate structural and leakage integrity during normal operating, transient, and
postulated accident conditions. It is recognized that defects in tubes permitted to remain in service, especially
cracks, occasionally grow entirely through-wall and develop small leaks. Limits on allowable primary-to-secondary
leakage established in Technical Specifications ensure timely plant shutdown before the structural and leakage
integrity of the affected tube is challenged. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The proposed license amendment request to implement voltage amplitude SG tube support plate Interim Plugging Criteria
for Byron Unit 1 meets the requirements of RG 1.121. The IPC methodology demonstrates that tube leakage is acceptably
low and tube burst is a highly improbable event during either normal operation or the most limiting accident condition,
a postulated main steam line break (MSLB) event. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Adequate SG tube leakage integrity during normal operating conditions is assured by limiting allowable primary-to-secondary
leakage to 150 gpd per SG or 600 gpd total. Currently, this limit is administratively controlled. However, a license
amendment request was submitted on 06/03/94 to incorporate this limit into the Byron Technical Specifications.
During normal operating conditions, the tube support plate constrains the [outer diameter stress corrosion cracking]
ODSCC affected area of the tube to provide additional strength that precludes burst. Any leakage of a tube exhibiting
ODSCC at the [tube support plate] TSP is fully bounded by the existing SG tube rupture analysis included in the Byron
UFSAR. Therefore, probability of failure of a tube left in service or consequences of tube failure during normal operating
conditions is not significantly increased by the application of IPC. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
During transients, the TSP is conservatively assumed to displace due to the thermal-hydraulic loads associated
with the transient. This may partially expose a crack which is within the boundary of the TSP during normal operations
to free span conditions. Burst is therefore conservatively evaluated assuming the crack is fully exposed to free
span conditions. The structural eddy current bobbin coil voltage limit for free-span burst is 4.54 volts. This limit
takes into consideration a 1.43 safety factor applied to the steam line break differential pressure that is consistent
with RG 1.121 requirements. With additional considerations for growth rate assumptions and an upper 95% confidence
estimate on voltage variability, the maximum voltage indication that could remain in service is reduced to 2.7 volts.
For added conservatism, the allowable indication voltage is further reduced in the proposed amendment to a 1.0 volt
confirmed ODSCC indication limit. All indications between 1.0 and 2.7 volts will be subject to an RPC examination.
Tubes with RPC confirmed ODSCC indications will be plugged or sleeved. Any ODSCC indications between 1.0 volt and
2.7 volts which are not confirmed as ODSCC will be allowed to remain in service since these indications are not as likely
to affect tube structural integrity or leakage integrity over the next operating cycle as the indications that are
detectable by both bobbin and [rotating pancake coil] RPC inspections. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The eddy current inspection process has been enhanced to address RG 1.83, ``Inservice Inspection of PWR Steam Generator
Tubes,'' Revision 1, July 1975, considerations as well as the EPRI SG Inspection Guidelines. Enhancements in accordance
with NUREG-1477 and Appendix A of the Catawba IPC report (WCAP-13698) are in place to increase detection of ODSCC indications
and to ensure reliable, consistent acquisition and analysis of data. Based on the conservative selection of the voltage
criteria and the increased ability to identify ODSCC, the probability of tube failure during an accident is also not
significantly increased due to application of requested IPC. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
For consistency with current offsite dose limits, the site allowable leakage limit during a MSLB has been conservatively
calculated to be 12.8 gpm. This leakage limit includes maximum allowable operational leakage from the unaffected
SGs and the accident leakage from the affected SG. As a requirement for operation following application of IPC, the
projected distribution of crack indications over the operating period must be verified to result in primary to secondary
accident leakage less than the site allowable leakage limit. Thus, the consequences of a MSLB remain unchanged. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Therefore, as implementation of the 1.0 volt IPC for Byron Unit 1 does not adversely affect steam generator tube integrity
and results in acceptable dose consequences, the proposed license amendment request does not result in any significant
increase in the probability or consequences of an accident previously evaluated within the Byron Updated Final Safety
Analysis Report. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
2. The proposed change does not create the possibility of a new or different kind of accident from any accident previously
evaluated. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Implementation of the proposed SG tube IPC does not introduce any significant changes to the plant design basis. Use
of the criteria does not provide a mechanism which could result in an accident outside the tube support plate elevations
since industry experience indicates that ODSCC originating within the tube support plate does not extend significantly
beyond the thickness of the support plate. This criteria only applies to ODSCC contained within the region of the tube
bounded by the tube support plate. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In addressing the combined effects of Loss of Coolant Accident (LOCA) coincident with a Safe Shutdown Earthquake
(SSE) on the SG (as required by General Design Criteria 2), it has been determined that tube collapse of select tubes
may occur in the SGs at some plants, including Byron Unit 1. There are two issues associated with SG tube collapse. First,
the collapse of SG tubing reduces the RCS flow area through the tubes. The reduction in flow area increases the resistance
to flow of steam from the core during a LOCA which, in turn, may potentially increase Peak Clad Temperature (PCT). Second,
there is a potential that partial through-wall cracks in tubes could progress to through-wall cracks during tube
deformation or collapse. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
A number of tubes have been identified, in the ``wedge'' locations of the SG TSPs, that demonstrate the potential for
tube collapse during a LOCA + SSE event. Because of this potential, these tubes have been excluded from application
of the voltage-based SG TSP IPC. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Therefore, neither a single or multiple tube rupture event would be expected in a steam generator in which IPC has been
applied. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
ComEd has implemented a maximum primary to secondary leakage limit of 150 gpd through any one SG at Byron to help preclude
the potential for excessive leakage during all plant conditions. The 150 gpd limit provides for leakage detection
and plant shutdown in the event of an unexpected single crack leak associated with the longest permissible free span
crack length. The 150 gpd limit provides adequate leakage detection and plant shutdown criteria in the event an unexpected
single crack results in leakage that is associated with the longest permissible free span crack length. Since tube
burst is precluded during normal operation due to the proximity of the TSP to the tube and the potential exists for the
crevice to become uncovered during MSLB conditions, the leakage from the maximum permissible crack must preclude
tube burst at MSLB conditions. Thus, the 150 gpd limit provides a conservative limit to prompt plant shutdown prior
to reaching critical crack lengths under MSLB conditions.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Upon implementation of the 1.0 volt IPC, steam generator tube integrity continues to be maintained through inservice
inspection and primary-to-secondary leakage monitoring. Therefore, the possibility of a new or different kind
of accident from any previously evaluated is not created. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
3. The proposed change does not involve a significant reduction in a margin of safety. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The use of the voltage based bobbin coil probe SG TSP IPC for Byron Unit 1 will maintain steam generator tube integrity
commensurate with the criteria of RG 1.121 as discussed above. Upon implementation of the criteria, even under the
worst case conditions, the occurrence of ODSCC at the TSP elevations is not expected to lead to a steam generator tube
rupture event during normal or faulted plant conditions. The distribution of crack indications at the TSP elevations
result in acceptable primary-to-secondary leakage during all plant conditions and radiological consequences
are not adversely impacted by the application of IPC. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The installation of SG tube plugs and sleeves reduces the RCS flow margin. As noted previously, implementation of
the SG TSP IPC will decrease the number of tubes which must be repaired by plugging or sleeving. Thus, implementation
of IPC will retain additional flow margin that would otherwise be reduced due to increased tube plugging. Therefore,
no significant reduction in the margin of safety will occur as a result of the implementation of this proposed license
amendment request. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Although not relied upon to prove adequacy of the proposed amendment request, the following analyses demonstrate
that significant conservatisms exist in the methods and justifications described above: 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
LIMITED TUBE SUPPORT PLATE DISPLACEMENT
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
An analysis was performed to verify [the effect] of limited TSP displacement during accident conditions (MSLB).
Application of minimum TSP displacement assumptions reduce the likelihood of a tube burst to negligible levels.
Consideration of limited TSP displacement would also reduce potential MSLB leakage when compared to the leakage
calculated assuming free span indications.

The Electric Power Research Institute (EPRI) Performance Demonstration Program analyzed the performance of approximately
20 eddy current data analysts evaluating data from a unit with 3/4'' inside diameter and 0.049'' wall thickness tubes.
The results of this analysis clearly show that the detectability of larger voltage indications is increased which
lends creditability for application of a POD of &gt; 0.62 for ODSCC indications larger than 1.0 volt.

RISK EVALUATION OF CORE DAMAGE
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
As part of ComEd's evaluation of the operability of Byron Unit 1 Cycle 7, a risk evaluation was completed. The objective
of this evaluation was to compare core damage frequency under containment bypass conditions, with and without the
interim plugging criteria applied at Byron Unit 1. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The total Byron core damage frequency is estimated to be 3.09E-5 per reactor year with a total contribution from containment
bypass sequences of 3.72E-8 per reactor year according to the results of the current individual plant evaluation
(IPE). Operation with the requested IPC resulted in an insignificant increase in core damage frequency resulting
from MSLB with containment bypass conditions. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Therefore, based on the evaluation above, ComEd has concluded that this proposed license amendment request does
not involve a significant hazards consideration.

Description of amendment request: 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The proposed amendment would add a License Condition to specify that commitments made in response to the March 14,
1983, NUREG-0737 Order shall be maintained pursuant to the requirements of 10 CFR 50.59.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
As required by 10 CFR 50.91(a), the licensee has provided its analysis of the issue of no significant hazards consideration,
which is presented below:

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=3 -->
Involve a significant increase in the probability or consequences of any accident previously analyzed:
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Commonwealth Edison has addressed all issues made in response to NUREG-0737. As such, the purpose of the post-TMI
Order is no longer served. The inclusion of the modified Order as a license condition is administrative in nature and
does not allow unregulated decreases in the level of safety; therefore, this license amendment is appropriate and
safe. The proposed license amendment requires control of NUREG-0737 commitments through 10 CFR 50.59. If an unreviewed
safety question occurs during the review of a NUREG 0737 item then Commonwealth Edison is obligated to submit a change
to the NRC staff as a license amendment. As a result of the proposed amendment, there are no physical changes to the facility
and all operating procedures, limiting conditions for operation (LCO), limiting safety system settings, and safety
limits specified in the Technical Specifications will remain unchanged. Therefore, the proposed license amendment
to modify the post-TMI Order will not increase the probability or the consequences of any accident previously analyzed.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Create the possibility of a new or different kind of accident from any previously evaluated:
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Since there are no changes in the way the plant is operated, the potential for a new or different kind of accident is not
created. The proposed changes are administrative in nature and do not affect any accident initiators for Dresden,
Quad Cities, and Zion Stations. No new failure modes are introduced.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Involve a significant reduction in a margin of safety:
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Plant safety margins are established through LCOs, limiting safety system settings, and safety limits specified
in the Technical Specifications. As a result of the proposed amendment, there will be no changes to either the physical
design of the plant or to any of these settings and limits. The proposed changes are administrative and do not affect
the safe operation of the sites. Therefore, there will be no changes to any of the margins of safety.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Guidance has been provided in 51 FR 7744 for the application of standards to license change requests for determination
of the existence of significant hazards considerations. This document provides examples of amendments which are
not likely considered to involve significant hazards considerations.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
This proposed amendment does not involve a significant relaxation of the criteria used to establish safety limits,
a significant relaxation of the bases for the limiting safety system setting or a significant relaxation of the bases
for the limiting conditions for operations. The proposed changes are administrative in nature without consequence
to the safety of the plant. Therefore, based on the guidance provided in the Federal Register and the criteria established
in 10 CFR 50.92(c), the proposed change does not constitute a significant hazards consideration.

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The proposed amendments would modify the Administrative Controls Section of the Technical Specifications by replacing

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
As required by 10 CFR 50.91(a), the licensee has provided its analysis of the issue of no significant hazards consideration
(SHC), which is presented below:
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->
... These proposed changes do not involve an SHC because the changes would not:
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
1. Involve a significant increase in the probability or consequences of an accident previously evaluated.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The NSAB is an oversight group which provides independent assessments of activities at the Haddam Neck Plant and Millstone
Unit Nos. 1, 2, and 3. The members of the NSAB are appointed by the Executive Vice President - Nuclear to provide oversight
and feedback on the operation of the units. The NSAB adds to the defense-in-depth provided by the design, operation,
maintenance, and quality oversight of the nuclear units by promoting excellence through the conduct of its affairs
and advising the Executive Vice President - Nuclear in matters concerning nuclear safety.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The proposed modification to the Technical Specifications are administrative in nature and will establish a new
group which will accomplish the guidance provided in ANSI N18.7-1976. The charter of the NSAB will be controlled by
procedure. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
These administrative changes will not increase the probability of occurrence or the consequences of an accident
previously evaluated.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
2. Create the possibility of a new or different kind of accident from any previously evaluated.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The proposed addition of the NSAB and its subcommittees and the ensuing elimination of the NRB and the SNRB is an administrative
reorganization. There are no changes in the way in which the plants are physically operated. The administrative changes
being accomplished by the establishment of the NSAB fulfills the function previously provided by the NRB and the SNRB.
The organization of the NSAB will follow the guidance found in ANSI N18.7-1976 and will be controlled by procedure.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
3. Involve a significant reduction in a margin of safety.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The proposed changes establish the requirements of the NSAB. The NSAB replaces those activities previously performed
by the NRB and the SNRB. With these changes the new organization will provide more consistent and clearer feedback
to the four units and the Executive Vice President - Nuclear.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The changes do not directly affect any protective boundaries nor do they impact the safety limits for the protective
boundaries. These proposed changes are administrative in nature. Therefore, there can be no reduction in the margin
of safety.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
1. There is no significant increase in the probability or consequences of an accident.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
This is an administrative change. Since this change maintains a consistent level of chairmanship while continuing
to ensure independence and technical expertise of the SNSC chairman, this change does not increase the probability
or consequences of an accident.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
2. The possibility of a new or different kind of accident from any previously evaluated has not been created.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
This is an administrative change of the designation of the Chairman of SNSC which does not significantly decrease
the level of senior management which is responsible for chairing SNSC. No new or different kind of accident has been
created.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
3. There has been no reduction in the margin of safety. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

which is presented below:
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->
The following analysis, performed pursuant to 10 CFR 50.91, shows that the proposed amendment will not create a significant
hazards consideration as defined by the criteria of 10 CFR 50.92.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
1. This amendment will not significantly increase the probability or consequence of any accident previously evaluated.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
No component modification, system realignment, or change in operating procedure will occur which could affect the
probability of any accident or transient. The relocation of boron concentration values to the COLR is an administrative
change which will have no effect on the probability or consequences of any previously-analyzed accident. The required
values of boron concentration will continue to be determined through use of approved methodologies.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
2. This amendment will not create the possibility of any new or different accidents not previously evaluated.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
No component modification or system realignment will occur which could create the possibility of a new event not previously
considered. The administrative change of relocating parameters to the COLR, in this case boron concentration, cannot
create the probability of an accident.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
3. This amendment will not involve a significant reduction in a margin of safety.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Required boron concentrations will remain appropriate for each cycle, and will continue to be calculated using approved
methodologies. There is no significant reduction in a margin of safety.

will be controlled by administrative controls which will be reviewed by the PORC and approved by the General Manager
Plant Operations.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The procedures governing plant operation will continue to ensure that plant parameters are maintained within acceptable

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The proposed amendment would move the requirements of Technical Specification 3/4.3.4 Turbine Overspeed Protection
from the technical specifications (TS) and relocate them in the Updated Final Safety Analysis Report (UFSAR) consistent
with the NRC Final Policy Statement on Technical Specifications Improvements for Nuclear Power Reactors.

Basis for proposed no significant hazards consideration determination: 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
As required by 10 CFR 50.91(a), the licensee has provided its analysis of the issue of no significant hazards consideration,
which is presented below:
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->
The proposed change relocates the Turbine Valve Overspeed Protection requirements from the TS to the Waterford 3
UFSAR consistent with the NRC Policy Statement on Technical Specification Improvements. Testing and inspections
of the turbine Overspeed Protection System will remain governed by an approved turbine maintenance program, described
in the UFSAR. This proposed change has no affect on the current Turbine Overspeed Protection requirements other then
to relocate them to the UFSAR. Thus, the probability of a turbine missile causing damage to a safety-related component
or structure at Waterford 3 as described in the FSAR analysis (Reference 5) is not affected. The purpose of the Turbine
Overspeed Protection System is to prevent an overspeed event, the precursor to a potential turbine fragment missile.
Since the purpose of this system is preventive, it serves no function to mitigate any accident previously evaluated.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Therefore, the proposed change will not involve a significant increase in the probability or consequences of any
accident previously evaluated.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The proposed change does not involve any change to the configuration or method of operation of any plant equipment.
No new failure modes or limiting failures have been identified as result of the proposed change. The proposed change
will not alte the operation of the plant or the manner in which it is operated. Any subsequent change to the Turbine Oversspeed
Protection System requirements will undergo a review in accordance with the criteria of 10 CFR 50.59 to ensure that
the change does not involve an unreviewed safety question.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Therefore, the proposed change will not create the possibility of a new or different kind of accident from any accident
prveiously evaluated.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The proposed change will relocate Turbine Overspeed Protection System requirements from the TS to the Waterford
3 UFSAR on the basis that the Turbine Overspeed Protection System does not meet the criteria of the NRC Final Policy
Statement on Technical Specifications Improvements for Nuclear Reactors. The requirements that will reside in
the UFSAR for the Turbine Overspeed Protection system will ensure that the system remains capable of protecting the
turbine from excessive overspeed. The proposed change will have no adverse impact on any protective boundary or safety
limit.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Therefore, the proposed change will not involve a significant reduction in a margin of safety.

Basis for proposed no significant hazards consideration determination: 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

As required by 10 CFR 50.91(a), the licensee has provided its analysis of the issue of no significant hazards consideration,
which is presented below:
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->
The standards used to arrive at a determination that a request for amendment involves a no significant hazards consideration
are included in the Commission's regulation, 10 CFR 50.92. 10 CFR 50.92 states that no significant hazards considerations
are involved if the operation of the facility in accordance with the proposed amendment would not (1) involve a significant
increase in the probability or consequences of an accident previously evaluated; or (2) create the possibility of
a new or different kind of accident from any accident previously evaluated; or (3) involve a significant reduction
in a margin of safety. Each standard is discussed as follows:
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(1) Operation of the facility in accordance with the proposed amendments would not involve a significant increase
in the probability or consequences of an accident previously evaluated.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The proposed amendments do not involve a significant increase in the probability or consequences of an accident previously
evaluated because the proposed amendments conform to the guidance given in Enclosure 1 of the NRC Generic Letter 93-05.
The overall functional capabilities of the incore detector system, reactor coolant system pressure isolation valves,
safety injection tank, or containment sump will not be modified by the proposed change. Therefore, the probability
or consequences of an accident are not significantly increased by the changes.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(2) Use of the modified specification would not create the possibility of a new or different kind of accident from any
previously evaluated.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The use of the modified specifications can not create the possibility of a new or different kind of accident from any
previously evaluated since the proposed amendments will not change the physical plant or the modes of plant operation
defined in the facility operating license. No new failure mode is introduced due to the surveillance interval changes
and clarifications, since the proposed changes do not involve the addition or modification of equipment nor do they
alter the design or operation of affected plant systems.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(3) Use of the modified specification would not involve a significant reduction in a margin of safety.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The operating limits and functional capabilities of the affected systems are unchanged by the proposed amendments.
Therefore, the modified specifications which establish new or clarify old surveillance intervals consistent with
the NRC Generic Letter 93-05 line-item improvement guidance do not significantly reduce any of the margins of safety.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Based on the above, we have determined that the proposed amendments do not (1) involve a significant increase in the
probability or consequences of an accident previously evaluated, (2) create the probability of a new or different
kind of accident from any previously evaluated, or (3) involve a significant reduction in a margin of safety; and therefore
do not involve a significant hazards consideration.

Pursuant to 10 CFR 50.92, a determination may be made that a proposed license amendment involves no significant hazards
consideration if operation of the facility in accordance with the proposed amendment would not: (1) involve a significant
increase in the probability or consequences of an accident previously evaluated; or (2) create the possibility of
a new or different kind of accident from any accident previously evaluated; or (3) involve a significant reduction
in a margin of safety. Each standard is discussed as follows:
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(1) Operation of the facility in accordance with the proposed amendment would not involve a significant increase
in the probability or consequences of an accident previously evaluated.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The proposed amendment will upgrade the existing Limiting Condition for Operation (LCO) associated with the Main
Feedwater Line Isolation Valves (MFIVs) to be consistent with NUREG-1432, Standard Technical Specifications for
Combustion Engineering Plants. The MFIVs are not initiators of accidents previously evaluated, but are included
as part of the success paths associated with mitigating various accidents and transients. The redundancy afforded
by two MFIVs per feedwater line in conjunction with the requirements of the proposed LCO assure that the feedwater
isolation safety function of these valves can be accomplished considering single failure criteria. Neither the
feedwater system design nor the safety function of the MFIVs have been altered from those previously evaluated, and
the proposed amendment does not change the applicable plant safety analyses.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Therefore, operation of the facility in accordance with the proposed amendment will not involve a significant increase
in the probability or consequences of an accident previously evaluated.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(2) Operation of the facility in accordance with the proposed amendment would not create the possibility of a new or
different kind of accident from any accident previously evaluated.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The proposed amendment will not change the physical plant or the modes of operation defined in the facility license.
The changes are administrative in nature in that they do not involve the addition of new equipment or the modification
of existing equipment, nor do they otherwise alter the design of St. Lucie Unit 2 systems. Therefore, operation of
the facility in accordance with the proposed amendment would not create the possibility of a new or different kind
of accident from any accident previously evaluated.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(3) Operation of the facility in accordance with the proposed amendment would not involve a significant reduction
in a margin of safety.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The safety function of the MFIVs is to terminate main feedwater flow and isolate the safety related portion from the
non-safety related portion of the feedwater system. The proposed amendment, in conjunction with the redundancy
afforded by the feedwater system design, assures that this safety function can be accomplished considering single-failure
criteria. The bases for required actions and the action completion times specified for inoperable MFIVs is consistent
with the corresponding specifications in NUREG-1432, which are equally applicable to St. Lucie Unit 2. The safety
analyses for applicable accidents and transients remain unchanged from those previously evaluated and reported
in the Updated Final Safety Analysis Report. Therefore, operation of the facility in accordance with the proposed
amendment would not involve a significant reduction in a margin of safety.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->
1) The proposed change to the Channel Functional Test frequency for the RBM will not significantly increase the probability
or consequences for any previously-evaluated event as we are only matching the mode requirements for performing
the SR to the OPERABILITY requirement for the RBM system, i.e., prior to 30% RTP. The system will be verified to be OPERABLE
prior to when it is assumed to be OPERABLE in the Updated Final Safety Analysis Report (UFSAR) for the DAEC.

Allowing the Channel Functional Test for the APRM Flow-Biased Rod Block Upscale and Downscale trips to be performed
``within 24 hours of entering RUN mode and prior to exceeding 25% RTP'' will not increase either the probability or
consequences of any previously-analyzed event. The applicable event for the rod block function during reactor startup
is a control Rod Withdrawal Error (RWE), which is initiated by either an operator error or malfunction within the Reactor
Manual Control System, not by a malfunction within the APRM system. However, a RWE event that could challenge the fuel
thermal limits is precluded because, as documented in the DAEC UFSAR (see Section 15.4) and the analysis submitted

 December 1984.), significant margin exists below 25% RTP to assure the Safety Limit Minimum Critical Power Ratio
(SLMCPR) is not violated by a RWE event. In addition, rod pattern controls are in place during this period to limit the
rod withdrawal sequence, i.e., rod worth, such that the fuel thermal limits would not be exceeded. The Control Rod
Drop Accident is unaffected by the requested SR change as the ``accident'' control rod is assumed to be de-coupled
from its drive mechanism and free-falls from fully inserted to fully-withdrawal. As the drive for that rod is assumed
to be fully-withdrawn as an initial condition in the event, the APRM rod block has no role in either preventing or mitigating
the rod drop accident. Thus, revising the SR for the APRM Flow-Biased Rod Block has no impact upon the Control Rod Drop
Accident.

The SRs for the Recirculation Flow Rod Block trips are being modified for consistency with the APRM Rod Block changes
above, as the sole purpose of this Recirculation Flow signal is to provide the flow input signal into the APRM Flow-Biased
trips. The Recirculation Flow units are a support system to the APRM Flow-Biased Rod Blocks. There is no event that
is either caused by or mitigated by the Recirculation Flow Rod Block trips. They are provided solely to ensure that
if the flow signal being input into the APRM circuits is not valid, a precautionary rod block will be generated as the
APRM Flow-Biased Rod Block setpoint could be in error. Consequently, allowing the Channel Functional Test for the
Recirculation Flow Rod Block Upscale, Downscale and Comparator trips to be performed ``within 24 hours of entering
RUN mode and prior to exceeding 25% RTP'' will not increase either the probability or consequences of any previously-analyzed
event as these rod blocks are not involved in either preventing or mitigating any analyzed event.

2) The proposed change to the Channel Functional Test frequency for the RBM will not introduce any new or different

The proposed change to the Channel Functional Test frequency for the APRM and Recirculation Flow Rod Blocks will not
introduce any new or different event, as no changes in either system design or operation are being made. In fact, by
allowing the Channel Functional Test to be performed in an operating state which does not require extensive use of
jumpers and/or relay blocks, we reduce the possibility of an error being made that could cause an inadvertent actuation
of an ESF or disabling of an ESF.

, prior to 30% RTP. The system will be verified to be OPERABLE prior to when it is assumed to be OPERABLE in the UFSAR accident
analysis. Thus, the margin of safety for the RBM is not reduced.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
As stated in the BASES for TS Chapter 3/4.2, the margin of safety for the APRM rod block is to prevent violation of the
SLMCPR in RUN by a RWE event. The analysis of the RWE event during Startup (See DAEC UFSAR Section 15.4.2) and during
Power Operation (Ibid), demonstrates that violations of the SLMCPR are not possible in RUN below 25% RTP when normal
control rod patterns are followed (which are reinforced by procedural and/or automatic rod pattern controls). Because
the proposed change to the SR for the APRM Flow-Biased Rod Block will still ensure that the trip will be OPERABLE prior
to exceeding 25% RTP, this change will not reduce the existing margin of safety.

Again, the Recirculation Flow units are a support system to the APRM flow-biased circuits. The Recirculation Flow
Rod Blocks are merely precautionary, they do not prevent or mitigate any accident. Therefore, the proposed revision

for the APRM Rod Blocks.

The changes being proposed do not alter the bases for assurance that safety-related activities are performed correctly
or the basis for any TS that is related to the establishment of or maintenance of a safety margin. Any relief from the
approved ASME Section XI Code equirements that is implemented prior to NRC review and approval will require evaluation
under the 10 CFR 50.59 process to determine that no TS changes or unreviewed safety questions exist. This evaluation
process will ensure that the impact on any Code relief does not affect the ability of structures, systems or components
to perform their design function, affect compliance with any TS requirements or reduce the margin of safety. Therefore,
operation of the facility in accordance with the proposed amendment would not involve a reduction in a margin of safety.

This license amendment request involves the upgrading of the Control Room Emergency Filter System from 341 cubic
feet per minute (CFM) plus or minus 10% to a maximum of &lt; 1000 CFM. By establishing a new maximum flowrate for this
system, additional filtered makeup air can be supplied to the Control Room, thus increasing the positive pressure
in the Control Room envelope. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The purpose ofthe Control Room Emergency Filter System is to remove radioactive iodine and other radioactive materials
from the makeup air during design basis accidents. Therefore, any change to this system will not increase the probability
of an accident previously evaluated. Radiological calculations show that the increased flowrate of this system
will not result in a significant increase in Control Room operator dose during a design basis accidents, and these
doses remain well below the established limits. Therefore, the consequences of an accident previously evaluated
are not significantly increased. The addition of the new Surveillance Requirement provides a Technical Specification
required periodic demonstration of the positive pressurization function of the system. This requirement has previously
been implemented per existing surveillance procedures as part of the overall Control Room Emergency Filter System
operability demonstration, and does not represent a new requirement. This proposed change does not introduce any
new modes of plant operation nor affect any operational setpoints. The change does not degrade the performance of
any safety system assumed to function in the accident analysis. Therefore, the proposed change does not involve a
significant increase in the probability or consequences of an accident previously evaluated.

This license amendment request involves the upgrading of the Control Room Emergency Filter System from 341 cubic
feet per minute (CFM) plus or minus 10% to a maximum of &lt; 1000 CFM. This proposed change involves a physical modification
to the Control Room Emergency Filter System where the filter fan is replaced with a new fan with greater capacity. To
accommodate the additional flow capacity of the system, an additional charcoal tray is installed in the charcoal
adsorber unit. The District has evaluated the potential effects of this modification and has determined that the
increased air flowrate is within the system capacity and that radiological doses, through the filter system, during
the design basis accident are largely unaffected. Because this is a modification of an existing system with no direct
interface with other systems responsible for prohibiting or mitigating design basis events, the District has concluded
that this proposed change cannot create the possibility for a new or different kind of accident. This proposed change
does not involve the creation, deletion, or modification of the function of any structure or system, except as described
above, nor does this change introduce or change any mode of plant operation. This proposed change does not create the
possibility for a new or different kind of accident from any accident previously evaluated.

This license amendment request involves the upgrading of the Control Room Emergency Filter System from 341 cubic
feet per minute (CFM) plus or minus 10% to a maximum of &lt; 1000 CFM. By establishing this new maximum flowrate for the
Emergency Filter System, additional filtered makeup air can be supplied to the Control Room envelope, thus improving
the margin for positive pressurization with respect to adjacent areas. Recent tests, utilizing the Main Control
Room Air Conditioning System, have provided information that supports an increase in the Emergency Filter System
flowrate, from 341 CFM to the proposed maximum system capability of approximately 1000 CFM. These tests indicate
that an increase of positive pressure can be achieved by this increased flowrate. This positive pressure increase
provides additional margin of Control Room envelope positive pressure.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The District has performed radiological calculations to determine the increase in Control Room operator dose during
the 30-day design basis LOCA event, as a result of increased system air flow. These calculations show increasing the
Control Room Emergency Filter System to a maximum of 1000 CFM results in a dose of 1.799 Rem whole body and 12.81 Rem thyroid.
These doses are not significantly different than the doses received at a system flowrate of 341 CFM, which is 1.745
Rem whole body and 11.39 Rem thyroid. These doses are well within the limits of 10 CFR 20, 10 CFR 50, Appendix A, General
Design Criteria 19, and the guidance provided in NUREG 0800, which require that doses be limited to less than 5 Rem whole
body, or its equivalent to any part of the body including 30 Rem thyroid, for the duration of any design basis accident.
The above calculated values have also been evaluated and determined to be within the Updated Safety Analysis Report
(USAR) Section XII requirement of 0.5 Rem in any eight-hour period, whole body from the reactor building. Increasing
the Control Room Emergency Filter System maximum flowrate has a minimal effect on quantifiable dose rates, while
increasing positive pressurization in the Control Room envelope. By increasing the positive pressurization in
the Control Room envelope, the possibility of non quantifiable radiation dose to the Control Room operators, through
inleakage, is reduced. This proposed change does not involve any change to instrument setpoints or operation. Therefore,
the District has concluded that this proposed change does not create a significant reduction in the margin of safety.

Description of amendment request:

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The proposed amendment would revise Technical Specifications (TSs) 2.2.2 (Reactor Coolant System), 3.2.8/4.2.8
(Pressure Relief Systems - Safety Valves), and the associated Bases to reduce the number of reactor head safety valves
required operable from 16 valves to 9 valves. The Nine Mile Point Nuclear Station Unit No. 1 (NMP1) reactor vessel was
designed to American Society of Mechanical Engineers Boiler and Pressure Vessel Code (ASME Code), Section I-1962
and Code Case 1271N. In order to show compliance with the ASME Code, it was assumed that a main steam isolation valve
(MSIV) closure occurred without scram. This assumption demonstrated that it was necessary to have 16 reactor head
safety valves. However, the licensee now states that Section 5.2.2.II.A of NUREG-0800 (Standard Review Plan) requires
that safety valves shall be designed with sufficient capacity to limit the pressure to less than 110 percent of the
reactor coolant system design pressure during the most severe abnormal operational transient with credit for reactor
scram. The licensee now proposes to use the high neutron flux scram in analyzing this event. The licensee states that
this results in a reduction in the number of safety valves required operable from 16 valves to 9 valves. The setpoints
of the valve groups would remain unchanged. Testing of the safety valves for setpoint and partial lift would be changed
to be in accordance with the NMP1 Inservice Test Program which is based upon ASME Code, Section XI, 1983, including
Summer Addenda.

The operation of Nine Mile Point Unit 1, in accordance with the proposed amendment, will not involve a significant
increase in the probability or consequences of an accident previously evaluated.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The proposed changes reduce the number of safety valves from sixteen (16) to nine (9). The function of the safety valves
is to provide code overpressure protection. This design basis event has been reanalyzed using the methodology documented
in NEDE-24011-P-A, General Electric Standard Application for Reactor Fuel (GESTAR). The reanalysis takes credit
for the high neutron flux scram in order to reduce the number of valves. Since peak pressure remains below the safety
limit, the consequences of the event remain the same. The resultant peak pressure is below the pressure safety limit
of 1375 psig. The only event initiator that involves safety valves is the spurious actuation of one valve. Since the
number of valves has been reduced, the probability of a spurious actuation has been reduced. Testing in accordance
with ASME Section XI will ensure that the safety valves lift at the required setpoints although the frequency of testing
has been reduced. Therefore, operation of Nine Mile Point Unit 1 in accordance with the proposed amendment, will not
involve a significant increase in the probability or consequences of an accident previously evaluated.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The operation of Nine Mile Point Unit 1, in accordance with the proposed amendment, will not create the possibility
of a new or different kind of accident from any accident previously evaluated.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The proposed change represents physical changes to the plant as described in the NMP1 Final Safety Analysis Report
(Updated). The proposed changes however, do not alter the method of providing overpressure protection, i.e., safety
valves. The valves continue to function to limit peak pressure below the safety limit. Therefore, maintaining reactor
vessel integrity. The reduction in number of safety valves results from taking credit for the high neutron flux scram
in the safety valve actuation transient as allowed by NUREG-0800. The initiating event, MSIV closure, remains unchanged.
Although the frequency of testing has been reduced, testing in accordance with the requirements of Section XI of the
ASME Code will ensure valves lift at the required setpoints. Thus, no potential initiating events are created which
would cause any new or different kinds of accidents. Therefore, operation of Nine Mile Point Unit 1 in accordance with
the proposed change will not create the possibility of a new or different kind of accident from any previously evaluated.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The operation of Nine Mile Point Unit 1, in accordance with the proposed amendment, will not involve a significant
reduction in a margin of safety.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The overpressure safety limit of 1375 psig remains unchanged. In addition to the initial conditions associated with
the safety valve actuation transient, NUREG-0800 allows the use of the high neutron flux scram. This results in the
reduction from sixteen (16) to nine (9) safety valves with peak pressure in the vessel still below the overpressure
safety limit. The margin of safety is defined as the range between the safety limit (1375 psig) and the failure point
of the vessel. Thus, since peak pressure is below the safety limit, the margin of safety has not been reduced. Additionally,
testing in accordance with ASME Section XI ensures operation at the required setpoints and does not result in reduction
with margin of safety. Therefore, the operation of Nine Mile Point Unit 1 in accordance with the proposed change will
not involve a significant reduction in a margin of safety.

Description of amendment request: 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The proposed amendment would revise Technical Specifications (TSs) 2.1.2 (Fuel Cladding Integrity), 3.1.7 (Fuel
Rods), 3.4.6/4.6.2 (Protective Instrumentation), and the associated Bases to allow the use of Range 10 on the Intermediate
Range Neutron Flux Monitors (IRMs) with the Reactor Protection System (RPS) low pressure trip for main steam line
isolation valve closure not in bypass. Changes are also being proposed to TS Tables 3.6.2.a/4.6.2.a (Instrumentation
that Initiates Scram) and TS Tables 3.6.2.g/4.6.2.g (Instrumentation that Initiates Control Rod Withdrawal Block)
to extend the calibration frequency of the Source Range Neutron Flux Monitors (SRMs) and the IRMs from prior to startup
and shutdown to once per operating cycle. In addition, the proposed amendment would change the Instrument Channel
Test interval for the SRMs and IRMs from prior to startup and shutdown to once per week. The licensee stated that these
changes are in accordance with NUREG-1433 (Improved Standard Technical Specifications for BWR/4). Associated
changes to TS Setpoints, Bases, References, and Notes for TSs 2.1.2, 3.1.7, and 3.6.2/4.6.2 are also being proposed.

Basis for proposed no significant hazards consideration determination: 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
As required by 10 CFR 50.91(a), the licensee has provided its analysis of the issue of no significant hazards consideration,
which is presented below:
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->
The operation of Nine Mile Point Unit 1, in accordance with the proposed amendment, will not involve a significant
increase in the probability or consequences of an accident previously evaluated.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The proposed changes expand the IRM operating range, deletes the coincident APRM [Average Power Range Monitor] downscale
scram trip and extend the calibration interval for the SRM/IRM System setpoints. The expansion of the startup operating
range is required to achieve the 1/2 decade overlap between the IRMs and the APRMs. Proper overlap improves plant safety
by ensuring a smooth transition between IRMs and APRMs. The evaluation of operation in IRM range 10 demonstrates that
the addition of range 10 along with the RPS low pressure isolation activated ensures that the fuel cladding integrity
safety limits would not be exceeded.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The increased IRM/APRM overlap reduces the probability of multiple APRM channels downscale in the transition between
the IRM and APRM Systems and thus eliminates the need for re-activation of the IRM scram when in the run mode. The scram
is replaced by an overlap surveillance which requires that the IRMs overlap by at least 1/2 decade with the APRMs during
normal shutdown. This surveillance ensures that the IRM/APRM overlap is maintained which is the basis for deletion
of the APRM downscale scram. With the improved overlap, the probability of multiple APRM channels being downscale
is reduced such that it is no longer a credible event and therefore, the APRM rod block in combination with proper operating
procedures, provides the same level of protection. Thus, normal plant operation is not affected by these changes
and the probability of previously analyzed accidents is not increased. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The new surveillance intervals and setpoints were calculated using the General Electric approved methodology documented
in NEDC-31336. The methodology in NEDC-31336 provides assurance that safety system actuation (i.e., reactor scram
or control rod withdrawal block) will occur prior to the associated system parameter, neutron flux, from exceeding
its analytical limit. Thus, plant response to previously analyzed accidents remains within previously determined
limits.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Therefore, the operation of Nine Mile Point Unit 1, in accordance with the proposed amendment, will not involve a significant
increase in the probability or consequences of an accident previously evaluated.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The operation of Nine Mile Point Unit 1, in accordance with the proposedamendment, will not create the possibility
of a new or different kind of accident from any accident previously evaluated.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The addition of IRM range 10, deletion of the APRM downscale scram tripand extension of the surveillance interval
for the SRM/IRM instrumentation, does not involve an initiation or failure not considered in the Final Safety Analysis
Report (Updated). The proposed changes do not alter the plant configuration and the initial conditions used for the
design basis accident are still valid. Thus, no potential initiating events are created which would cause any new
or different kinds of accidents. Therefore, operation of Nine Mile Point Unit 1 in accordance with the proposed amendment,
will not create the possibility of a new or different kind of accident from any previously analyzed.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The operation of Nine Mile Point Unit 1 in accordance with the proposed amendment, will not involve a significant reduction
in a margin of safety.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The addition of IRM range 10 ensures sufficient overlap with the APRM System such that switching between startup and
run can be easily accomplished. The requirement for having the low reactor pressure isolation in effect when operating
in IRM range 10 is to prevent a potential depressurization event. Analysis has shown that the margin between the existing
safety limits and those events previously analyzed has not been reduced. The deletion of the coincident APRM scram
trip has also been shown not to result in a decrease in the margin of safety as the APRM downscale control rod withdrawal
block provides adequate protection. The analytical limits associated with the SRM/IRM instrumentation have been
reconstituted in conjunction with extending the surveillance interval to once per operating cycle. The results
using the methodology defined in NEDC-31336 required that various setpoints in the Technical Specifications be
changed, however, these changes do not reduce the margins between any existing safety limits and previously analyzed
events. Therefore, operation of Nine Mile Point Unit 1, in accordance with the proposed amendment, will not involve
a significant reduction in a margin of safety.

Description of amendment request: 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The proposed change would reword Technical Specification 3.7, ``Containment Systems,'' to permit operation with
one of the two circuits of the reactor building ventilation logic temporarily inoperable. In addition, Section 3.7.C.1.b
will be reworded to not permit movement of irradiated fuel, or movement of any loads over irradiated fuel, without
secondary containment integrity.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Basis for proposed no significant hazards consideration determination: 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
As required by 10 CFR 50.91(a), the licensee has provided its analysis of the issue of no significant hazards consideration,
which is presented below:
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->
NNECO has reviewed the proposed changes in accordance with 10CFR50.92 and concluded that the changes do not involve
a significant hazards consideration (SHC). The basis for this conclusion is that the three criteria of 10CFR50.92(c)
are not compromised. The proposed changes do not involve a SHC because the changes would not:
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
1. Involve a significant increase in the probability or consequences of an accident previously analyzed.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The function of a reactor building ventilation isolation is to limit fission product release in the event of a design
basis accident (DBA). Two dampers in series are provided in both the supply and exhaust lines of the reactor building
ventilation so that no single failure would result in the failure to isolate these secondary containment penetrations.
The proposed change permits one of the two circuits of the reactor building ventilation isolation logic to be temporarily
inoperable.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Millstone Unit No. 1 DBAs that could be affected by the proposed LCO [Limiting Condition for Operation] are those
in which the secondary containment is credited to isolate and contain fission products. The probability of occurrence
of any of these accidents is not altered by changes to the operation of secondary containment. There is a small potential
increase in the consequence of an accident previously evaluated. This is due to the small increase in probability
that a release could occur while Millstone Unit No. 1 is operating in the proposed LCO.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The increase in public risk due to the proposed LCO is negligible. The associated increase in risk is similar to the
increase in public risk permitted by other LCOs. A PRA [probabilistic risk assessment] has determined that the probability
of an event with a radioactive release in the reactor building, concurrent with a failure of both operable ventilation
dampers to function, while in the 7-day LCO, is very small.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The wording change to Technical Specification 3.7.C.1.b would result in more conservative restrictions, in that
secondary containment integrity would be required when any load (e.g., new fuel) is being moved over irradiated fuel.
As currently written, the Technical Specification only requires secondary containment integrity when the fuel
cask or irradiated fuel is being moved. Therefore, qualitatively, this change would have a positive impact on the
probability and consequences of accidents involving spent fuel.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Based upon the above, the proposed changes do not constitute a significant increase in the probability or consequence
of an accident previously evaluated.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
2. Create the possibility of a new or different kind of accident from any previously analyzed.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The proposed addition of a new LCO which allows operation with one circuit of the reactor building ventilation isolation
logic inoperable for up to seven days, would only affect the reliability of the secondary containment isolation.
No new equipment is being added, and no new type of operation is being introduced. This change allows a short (seven
day) period of operation when the reactor building ventilation is not single failure proof. The reactor building
ventilation functions to mitigate the consequences of accidents. Failure to function, therefore, does not create
the possibility of a different kind of accident.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The proposed change to Section 3.7.C.1.b increases the restrictions on load handling, thereby decreasing the possibility
of any kind of accident involving irradiated fuel.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Therefore, the proposed changes to the Technical Specifications do not create the possibility of a new or different
kind of accident from any previously evaluated.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
3. Involve a significant reduction in the margin of safety.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The proposed changes would permit temporary plant operation with a small decrease in the reliability of secondary
containment isolation. However, the reliability of the reactor building ventilation isolation would remain high
enough with the proposed LCO, that the impact on the protective boundaries and the margin of safety would be insignificant.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The proposed change to Section 3.7.C.1.b increases the restrictions on load handling, decreasing the possibility
of any kind of accident involving irradiated fuel. Therefore this change would not constitute a significant reduction
in the margin of safety.

... The proposed changes would not involve an SHC [significant hazards consideration] because the changes would

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
1. Involve a significant increase in the probability or consequences of an accident previously evaluated.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The proposed changes are clarifications or relocation of existing technical specification requirements and do
not substantively affect plant operation. Since they do not affect plant operations, they cannot be initiators of
any events.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The safety analysis of the plant is unaffected by the proposed changes. Since the safety analysis is unaffected, the
calculated radiological releases associated with the accident analyses are not affected. Therefore, the proposed
changes will not increase the probability or consequences of previously evaluated accidents.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
2. Create the possibility of a new or different kind of accident from any accident previously evaluated. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
As previously stated, the proposed changes are clarifications or relocation of existing technical specifications
and do not substantively affect plant operation. No new failure modes are introduced. Since the proposed modifications
do not affect plant operations, they cannot be initiators of new events.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
3. Involve a significant reduction in a margin of safety.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The proposed changes are clarifications or relocation of existing technical specifications and are not substantive
changes. The correction of the title in Figure 3.1-5 will ensure consistency throughout the technical specifications.
The relocation of the CVCS valves requirements from the RCS [Reactor Coolant System] - Cold Shutdown Specification
to the Reactivity Control Systems - Shutdown Margin specification will ensure the CVCS valves requirements are located
in the most appropriate location and will help the operators from the commission of errors or omission of actions due
to inappropriately located material. The final change will revise the action statement sections of the specification
pertaining to heat flux hot channel factor to ensure all actions in these specifications are clearly displayed and
not contained in the corresponding surveillance requirements. Therefore, since these changes are editorial in
nature, the proposed modification will have no impact on the margin of safety.

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG QTAG 01 -->
<!-- PJG /QTAG -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->
a. Does the proposed amendment involve a significant increase in the probability or consequences of an accident previously
evaluated?
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The proposed changes do not involve a significant increase in the probability or consequences of an accident previously
evaluated because the proposed changes do not alter the operation of equipment assumed to be an initiator or any analyzed
event or assumed to be available for the mitigation of accidents or transients. Proposed changes 1 and 2 are administrative
in nature. Proposed change 3 to reduce the required frequency for performing the periodic inspection for water accumulation
in the containment vessel below ground level does not impact the probability of ground water intrusion into the containment
building. Proposed change 3 maintains adequate assurance that integrity of the containment building with respect
to ground water entry will be maintained. The design of Unit 1 makes it very difficult for ground water to reach the exterior
of the containment liner to start the metal corrosion process. The concrete layer between the rock and the containment
liner serves as a barrier to prevent water migration to the liner shell. A cathodic protection system provides protective
current to the containment liner as well as nearby underground piping. The steel containment liner of Unit 1 should
not corrode under the present environmental conditions or any anticipated future conditions even without an operating
cathodic protection system. Monthly inspections from May 1990 (following issuance of Amendment No. 7 to the Possession-Only
License No. DR-12 on April 25, 1990) through April 1994 have not detected any water in the containment building. Prior
to Amendment No. 7, the inspection of Unit 1 was performed semi-annually. A review of these semi-annual inspections
dating back to October 1981 determined that water has never been detected in the accessible areas below ground level
in the containment building. The TS limit water accumulation in the containment sump to 500 gallons. Twelve and one-half
years of inspections have confirmed the reliability of the design of Unit 1 to maintain integrity against any ground
water intrusion. There is no reason, based on the review of inspection data, why the inspection could not be performed
semi-annually rather than monthly. Therefore, these proposed changes do not increase the probability or consequences
of an accident previously evaluated.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
b. Does the proposed amendment create the possibility of a new or different kind of accident from any accident previously
evaluated?
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The proposed changes do not create the possibility of a new or different kind of accident from any accident previously
evaluated because implementation of the proposed changes do not involve any physical changes to plant systems, structures,
or components. The proposed changes do not affect the plant SAFSTOR status. Therefore, the possibility of a new or
different kind of accident from any accident previously evaluated is not created.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
c. Does the proposed amendment involve a significant reduction in a margin of safety?
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The proposed changes do not involve a significant reduction in a margin of safety because the proposed changes do not
affect the plant SAFSTOR status. Because proposed changes 1 and 2 are administrative in nature, they do not involve
a question of safety. The semi-annual inspection of the accessible areas below ground level in the containment building
for water accumulation, as proposed by change 3, is adequate to ensure containment building integrity is maintained
with respect to ground water. Therefore, the proposed changes do not involve a significant reduction in a margin of
safety.

Description of amendment request:

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The proposed changes would revise Sections 3.4 and 3.5 of the Technical Specifications. The Section 3.4 revision
would reduce the maximum allowable percent of rated power associated with inoperable Main Steam Safety Valves (MSSVs).
This change would modify Table 3.4-1 and the associated Basis such that the maximum power level allowed for operation
with inoperable MSSVs is below the heat removing capability of the operable MSSVs. The Section 3.5 revision would
correct administrative errors in the action statements associated with Items 2.a and 2.c of Table 3.5-4. Additionally,
the proposed changes to Item 2.b of Table 3.5-3 and Item 2.b of Table 3.5-4 would clarify the action statements associated
with inoperable high containment pressure (Hi-Hi Level) instrumentation.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The proposed license amendment does not involve a significant increase in the probability or consequences of an accident
previously evaluated. This proposed technical specification change would modify Table 3.4-1 and the associated
basis such that the maximum power level allowed for operation with inoperable MSSVs is below the heat removing capability
of the operable MSSVs. This proposed technical specification change will be more conservative than the current technical
specifications. Proposed changes to Items 2.a and 2.c of Table 3.5-4 would restore the original intent of the specifications
and remove undue restrictions on the plant. Proposed changes to Item 2.b of Table 3.5-3 and Item 2.b of Table 3.5-4 clarify
the action statements associated with inoperable high containment pressure (Hi-Hi Level) instrumentation.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The proposed changes would revise the fuel oil availability requirements for the Emergency Diesel Generators (EDGs)
from Section 3.7 of the Technical Specifications (TSs). This TS change would require that 30,026 gallons of fuel oil
be available onsite in addition to the oil in the EDG storage tanks. TS 3.7.F.4 is also being changed to require a total
of 7056 gallons of fuel in the EDG fuel oil storage tanks. In addition, several administrative changes are being proposed
to remove the word ``available'' from the phrase ''... gallons of fuel available...'' in Section 3.7.A.5 (for the
individual storage tanks) to avoid confusion regarding the amount of usable fuel in the tanks.

Response:
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The proposed changes do not involve a significant increase in the probability or consequences of an accident previously
analyzed. The change in the minimum required volume for the EDG fuel oil storage tanks ensures that two EDGs can power
minimum safeguards equipment for 48 hours. The new required levels allow for temperature effects on fuel density
and calibration uncertainties. The change to the minimum amount of fuel that must be stored onsite is based on a new
fuel consumption profile and ensures that sufficient oil is present, even in the unlikely event that one EDG storage
tank (and its associated day tank) is unavailable. The change to specification 3.7.F.4 is consistent with the newly
calculated amount of usable fuel and instrument uncertainties.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The deletion of the word ``available'' from Section 3.7.A.5 (concerning the individual storage tanks) and the change

Response:
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The proposed changes do not create the possibility of a new or different kind of accident from any accident previously
evaluated because the changes do not affect current plant configuration or how the plant operates. The proposed change
in the minimum required volume for the EDG fuel oil storage tanks ensures an adequate amount of usable fuel and allows
for temperature effects on fuel density and calibration uncertainties. The change to the minimum amount of fuel that
must be stored onsite is based on a new fuel consumption profile and ensures that sufficient oil is present, even in
the unlikely event that one EDG storage tank (and its associated day tank) is unavailable. These changes do not alter
how the fuel storage tanks operate and therefore do not create the possibility of a new or different kind of accident.
Specification 3.7.F.4 is being changed consistent with the revised calculation.

The proposed changes do not involve a significant reduction in a margin of safety. The proposed change in the minimum

Description of amendment request:

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The proposed amendment would modify the Technical Specifications (TSs) to revise the primary containment atmosphere
monitoring and drywell to torus differential pressure requirements. Specifically, TS 3.7.A.6 would be revised
to adopt primary containment inerting/deinerting requirements that are consistent with NUREG-1433, ``Standard
Technical Specifications - General Electric Plants, BWR/4.'' TSs 4.7.A.6.a and 4.7.A.7.a would be revised to provide
frequencies for the verifications of primary containment oxygen concentration and pressure differential between
the drywell and torus. TSs 3.7.A.7.a.(1) and 3.7.A.7.a.(3) would be revised to provide requirements for establishing
and maintaining differential pressure between the drywell and torus that are consistent with NUREG-1433. Several
administrative changes to Tables 3.2-8 and 4.3-8 were also proposed to improve the overall quality of the TSs.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->
Operation of the FitzPatrick plant in accordance with the proposed Amendment would not involve a significant hazards
consideration as defined in 10 CFR 50.92, since it would not:
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
1. involve a significant increase in the probability or consequences of an accident previously evaluated.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The proposed changes revise primary containment atmosphere monitoring requirements. The proposed changes adopt
reference plant operating conditions (i.e., 15% rated thermal power) for inerting/de-inerting requirement as
well as for the drywell to torus differential pressure monitoring consistent with the NRC guidance provided in the
Standard Technical Specifications. The FitzPatrick Technical Specifications currently allow a 24 [hour] grace
period following startup or before shutdown in which the primary containment does not have to be inerted. During this
24 hour time period required leak inspections as well as inerting or shutdown evolutions are completed. Making the
24 hour ``window'' contingent upon core thermal power will allow [operators] to place the mode switch in run sooner,
removing startup neutron monitoring instrumentation scrams (i.e., APRM 15% and IRM upscale/inop). This reduces
the probability of spurious trips due to spiking of this instrumentation. The proposed changes do not involve physical
modification to the plant nor involve any accident initiators. Therefore, the probability of an accident occurring
remains unchanged. Accident analyses contained in FSAR [Final Safety Analysis Report] Chapter 14 assume that a LOCA
[Loss-of-coolant accident] occurs from full power. The consequences of a LOCA below 15% rated thermal power would
be less severe and would produce less hydrogen.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The proposed changes to Tables 3.2-8 and 4.2-8 will eliminate the reference to Specifications 3.7.A.9 by moving the
primary containment atmosphere monitoring requirements from Specification 3.7.A.9 to Table 3.2-8, Note F. Note
F is also revised such that if recorder 279CR-101A or B is inoperable, a daily monitoring and logging of the appropriate
parameter on the associated indicator on panel 279CX-101A, B is acceptable in lieu of taking grab samples. The monitoring
will be performed using indicators on 279CX-101A and B which are Regulatory Guide 1.97 qualified analyzers. The proposed
new Note K is added for completeness. These changes are administrative in nature and will improve the overall quality
of the technical specifications. Therefore, the proposed changes do not involve a significant increase in the probability
or consequences of an accident previously evaluated.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
2. create the possibility of a new or different kind of accident from any accident previously evaluated.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The proposed changes revise primary containment atmosphere monitoring requirements by adopting STS [Standard
Technical Specifications] guidance regarding inerting/de-inerting requirements. Consistent with this change
the drywell to torus differential pressure monitoring requirement is being revised. Adopting the STS reference
plant operating condition of 15% rated thermal power adds operational flexibility. The proposed changes do not create
the possibility of a new or different kind of accident from any accident previously evaluated because the plant safety
analyses assume that a LOCA occurs at full power. In addition, several changes are proposed to Tables 3.2-8 and 4.2-8
which simplify hydrogen/oxygen monitoring requirements by moving the primary containment monitoring requirements
from Specification 3.7.A.9 to Table 3.2-8. These changes are administrative in nature and will result in the overall
improvement to the Technical Specifications. Therefore, the proposed changes do not create the possibility of a
new or different kind of accident from any accident previously evaluated.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
3. involve a significant reduction in a margin of safety.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The proposed changes revise the primary containment atmosphere inerting/de-inerting requirements and the drywell
to torus differential pressure monitoring requirement. The proposed change will allow inerting within 24 hours
of exceeding 15% rated thermal power during startup and de-inerting 24 hours prior to reducing thermal power to less
than 15% of rated before a plant shutdown. These requirements are consistent with the guidance provided in the STS.
This proposed change does not affect the assumptions or conclusions contained in the plant safety analyses which
assume that a LOCA occurs from full power. The consequences of a LOCA below 15% rated thermal power would be less severe
and would produce less hydrogen. The proposed changes to Tables 3.2-8 and 4.3-8 are administrative in nature. Therefore,
the proposed changes do not involve a significant reduction in a margin of safety.

PSE&amp;G has, pursuant to 10 CFR 50.92, reviewed the proposed amendment to determine whether our request involves

with the proposed changes:

Station Service Water System (SSWS) Changes
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Engineering evaluations of the SSWS/Safety Auxiliaries Cooling System (SACS) demonstrate that adequate heat removal
capability is maintained in the post LOCA/LOP period with either two SSWS/SACS pumps in one loop or with one SSWS/SACS
pump in each independent loop. The risk evaluations contained in the Probabilistic Safety Assessment analyses of
the SSWS determined that the probability of an accident previously evaluated does not significantly change by increasing
the SSWS pump AOT from 7 days to 30 days. The evaluations demonstrated that the relative risk remained low with an increased
(and more appropriate) AOT due to capabilities of the Hope Creek SSWS to accommodate active failures.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Increasing the SSWS pump AOT does not involve physical alteration of any plant equipment and does not affect analysis
assumptions regarding functioning of required equipment designed to mitigate the consequences of accidents. Further,
the severity of postulated accidents and resulting radiological effluent releases will not be affected by the increased
AOT.

The risk evaluations contained in the Probabilistic Safety Assessment analysis of the SACS determined that the probability
of an accident previously evaluated does not significantly change by increasing the SACS pump AOT from 72 hours to
30 days. Similarly, the provision of a 72 hour AOT for one SACS pump inoperable in each SACS loop does not significantly
change the probability of an accident previously evaluated. The evaluations demonstrated that the relative risk
remained low with an increased (and more appropriate) AOTs due to capabilities of the Hope Creek SACS to accommodate
active failures.

The proposed changes to ACTION Statement a.2 of Technical Specification 3.7.1.1 precludes overly conservative
and improper operator action (initiation of plant shutdown procedures) to comply with the requirements in the situation
in which one of the affected EDGs (an EDG cooled by the inoperable SACS loop) is not realigned to OPERABLE SACS loop.
Currently, Hope Creek can simultaneously be in the ACTION Statement for Technical Specifications 3.7.1.1 and 3.8.1.1.
Simultaneous entry into these ACTION Statements bounds the conditions of the plant when the proposed requirements
of the Technical Specification 3.7.1.1, ACTION Statement a.2 are met. For this reason, the proposed changes will
not increase the probabilities or consequences of an accident previously evaluated.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Technical Specification 3.7.1.1, ACTION Statements b., c. and d. are being revised to require that the RHR loop or
safety related equipment must be declared inoperable when two SACS pumps in the associated SACS loop are inoperable.
This change permits one SACS pump to be inoperable without affecting the operability of the associated RHR loop or
safety related equipment. Engineering evaluations demonstrate that two SACS loops with one pump and two heat exchangers
per loop can provide the required heat removal capability in the post DBA LOCA/LOP scenario and maintain safe shutdown
conditions. Therefore, a SACS loop with one OPERABLE SACS pump should still be considered as a 100% functional SACS
loop, capable of supplying sufficient cooling for RHR and safety related equipment required by Specifications 3.4.9.1,
3.4.9.2, 3.5.2, 3.9.11.1 and 3.9.11.2. For this reason, the proposed changes will not increase the probabilities
or consequences of an accident previously evaluated.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In conclusion, the above SACS changes do not involve a significant increase in the probability or consequences of
an accident previously evaluated.

Emergency Diesel Generator AOT Extensions.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Hope Creek offsite and onsite power systems are highly reliable. The risk evaluations contained in the Probabilistic
Safety Assessment analyses of the onsite power system determined that the probability of an accident previously
evaluated does not significantly change by increasing the diesel generator AOT from 72 hours to 30 days for one inoperable
diesel generator or from 2 hours to 72 hours for two inoperable diesel generators. The evaluations demonstrated that
the relative risk remained low with an increased (and more appropriate) AOT due to capabilities of the four channel
onsite Class-1E electrical system design at Hope Creek.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Increasing the diesel generator AOT does not involve physical alteration of any plant equipment and does not affect
analysis assumptions regarding functioning of required equipment designed to mitigate the consequences of accidents.
Further, the severity of postulated accidents and resulting radiological effluent release will not be affected
by the increased AOT. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Therefore, the proposed change does not involve a significant increase in the probability or consequences of an accident
previously evaluated.

The proposed changes would require that the requisite number of diesel generators be in an operable condition, but
would eliminate the restriction that the 18 month maintenance inspection and other surveillance tests be performed
only while the unit is shutdown. Because all operational conditions (governed by the operability of the equipment
prescribed as necessary in Technical Specification 3.8.1.1) and the associated actions are defined elsewhere in

Description of amendment request: 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The proposed Technical Specification changes contained herein represent changes to Section 3/4.8.1 ``AC Sources.''
The revised specification removes the surveillance requirements, methodology and frequency for Emergency Diesel
Generator (EDG) fuel oil from the Technical Specifications and relocates them in a controlled plant procedure, VSH.SS-CA.ZZ-0013(Q)
``Procedure for Testing Diesel Fuel and #2 Fuel Oil at Artificial Island for PSE&amp;G Nuclear Operations.'' The
changes also delete an unnecessary lab test for the fuel oil and extend the surveillance frequency from once per 92
days to once per 184 days.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
As required by 10 CFR 50.91(a), the licensee has provided its analysis of the issue of no significant hazards consideration,
which is presented below: 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->
1. Will not involve a significant increase in the probability or consequences of an accident previously evaluated.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The proposed change to delete a test not required by Regulatory Guide 1.137 or ASTM-D975-77 will not result in degradation
of fuel oil quality below acceptable limits. Based on established fuel oil quality history, the proposed increase
in surveillance frequency from once per 92 days to once per 184 days will not significantly decrease confidence in
fuel oil quality and EDG operability, nor will the relocation of fuel oil quality surveillance from the Technical
Specifications to the Diesel Fuel Oil Testing Program have any effect on established plant practices in regards to
the testing of EDG fuel oil. The proposed changes involve no hardware changes, no changes to the operation of any systems
or components, and no changes to existing structures. Therefore, these changes will not alter or impact previously
evaluated accidents. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
2. Will not create the possibility of a new or different kind of accident from any previously evaluated.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The proposed changes are procedural in nature concerning fuel oil testing and, therefore, will not directly impact
the operation of any plant safety related component or equipment. Any reduction in fuel oil quality will not be significant
or result in a decrease in EDG operability. Therefore, these changes will not create a new or unevaluated operating
condition.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
3. Will not involve a significant reduction in a margin of safety.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The proposed changes concern how EDG fuel oil quality is to be determined, how frequently this determination is to
be performed, and how to control the process for determining fuel oil acceptability, and therefore EDG operability.
There are no associated safety margins and the only margin of concern is that of fuel oil combustibility due to the presence
of either contaminants or particulate buildup from long term storage. Based on historical data, PSE&amp;G believes
that EDG fuel oil quality will not be affected or impacted by the proposed changes. Therefore, the proposed amendment
does not involve any reduction in a safety margin.

This is a proposal to revise the Units 2 and 3 Technical Specification (TS) 3/4.7.3, ``Component Cooling Water System,''
and the corresponding Bases to support the addition of the component cooling water surge tank backup nitrogen supply

Basis for proposed no significant hazards consideration determination: 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
As required by 10 CFR 50.91(a), the licensee has provided its analysis of the issue of no significant hazards consideration,
which is presented below:
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->
1. Will operation of the facility in accordance with this proposed change involve a significant increase in the probability
or consequences of an accident previously evaluated?
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Response: No.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Component Cooling Water (CCW) system removes heat to mitigate the consequences of those design basis accidents
included in chapter 15 of the Updated Final Safety Analysis Report (UFSAR). A CCW system failure is not an accident
initiating event as listed in the UFSAR, Table 15.0-2. The addition of the Backup Nitrogen Supply (BNS) system does
not change the CCW system function and does not interface with any system which relates to the initiating events listed
in Table 15.0-2 of the UFSAR. The BNS system is designed to Quality Class II, Seismic Category I requirements and will
increase CCW reliability by minimizing CCW system voiding during and after a Design Basis Event (DBE). Failure of
the BNS system will not by itself result in an accident or have any effect on normal plant operation. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The proposed revision of Technical Specification (TS) 3/4.7.3 will not change the CCW system operation. This amendment
request retains the original CCW TS requirements and adds provisions specifically limited to the BNS system. The
proposed revisions provide an 8-hour Allowed Outage Time (AOT) for one or both trains of the BNS system inoperable
to avoid unnecessary plant power reductions. If the 8-hour AOT for BNS system inoperability is not met, the associated
CCW train(s) must be declared inoperable. The 8-hour AOT followed by either the 72-hour AOT for one train of CCW inoperable
or the 1-hour AOT provided by TS 3.0.3 for both trains of CCW inoperable results in overall AOTs of 80 and 9 hours, respectively.
The results of a conservative Probabilistic Risk Assessment demonstrate that for the overall 80-hour and 9-hour
AOTs the increases in core damage risk per year are 6.5E-7 and 8.6E-7, respectively. This results in less than a 3% increase
in the annual core damage risk for Units 2 and 3. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The proposed revisions to TS 3/4.7.3 include surveillance requirements to provide assurance that the BNS system
remains OPERABLE when required to support CCW operation. Therefore, operation of the facility in accordance with
this proposed TS change will not involve a significant increase in the probability or consequences of an accident
previously evaluated.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
2. Will operation of the facility in accordance with this proposed amendment create the possibility of a new or different
kind of accident from any accident previously evaluated?
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Response: No
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The BNS system does not change the CCW system function and does not interface with any system related to the initiating
events listed in Table 15.0-2 of the UFSAR. The BNS system is designed to Seismic Category I requirements and will minimize
CCW system voiding and the potential for a subsequent water hammer by maintaining the CCW surge tank pressure during
and after a DBE. No new High Energy Line Break considerations apply because the nitrogen bottle pressure is reduced
at the bottle header and all connections are less than one inch in diameter. The BNS system is independent from all systems
possibly related to the initiating DBEs listed in the UFSAR Table 15.0-2. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The proposed TS 3/4.7.3 revision does not change the existing CCW system requirements. This proposed change adds
operability and surveillance requirements for the BNS system to support CCW system operability and provide additional
assurance that plant operation is consistent with the design basis. Failure of the BNS system will not by itself result
in an accident or have any effect on normal plant operation. Therefore, the proposed changes will not create the possibility
of a new or different kind of accident from any accident previously evaluated.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
3. Will operation of the facility in accordance with this proposed amendment involve a significant reduction in a
margin of safety?
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Response: No
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The addition of the BNS system enhanced the CCW system by minimizing the possibility for water hammer following certain
postulated events. Surveillance and nitrogen bottle change-out procedures assure that the BNS system is available
to perform its safety-related function. The redundant cooling capacity of the CCW system is maintained by providing
an independent dedicated BNS system for each CCW critical loop, assuming a single failure. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The safety function of the BNS system is limited to the minimization of void formation in the CCW system under a specific
set of coincident circumstances following a DBE. The proposed revision to TS 3/4.7.3 allows the BNS system to have
one or both trains inoperable for 8 hours before the associated CCW train(s) must be declared inoperable. The BNS system
AOTs do not affect plant operation because the BNS system is not normally in operation. The BNS system action statements
are not normally entered for normal bottle change out since the BNS system is designed with one more bottle than is required
for seven days of BNS system operation. Therefore, the proposed changes do not involve a reduction in a margin of safety.

which is presented below:
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->
1. Involve a significant increase in the probability or consequences of an accident previously evaluated.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The proposed Technical Specification changes involve relocating requirements that are not conditions or limitations
on reactor operation necessary to obviate the possibility of an abnormal situation or event giving rise to an immediate
threat to the public health and safety. The proposed changes were identified through the application of criteria
designed to cull those requirements that are not important to operational safety from the Technical Specifications.
In this process, selected provisions of the Technical Specifications identified for relocation were retained if
necessary to support a Technical Specification that was to be retained. Thus, only specification requirements that
have little or no operational safety significance are proposed for relocation. In addition, those requirements
that would be relocated will be included in the Final Safety Analysis Report (FSAR) and, therefore, will be controlled
and implemented as FSAR commitments. In this manner, those requirements that have no operational safety significance
but involve maintaining the plant in its as-designed state, (for example, through surveillance programs) would
be controlled.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In addition, the criteria for identifying requirements to be retained in Technical Specifications specifically
call out, for retention, those structures, systems, or components that are required to mitigate accidents previously
evaluated.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Based on the above, the proposed changes do not involve a significant increase in the probability or consequences
of an accident previously evaluated.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
2. Create the possibility of a new or different kind of accident from any previously evaluated.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The proposed changes involve relocating Technical Specification requirements to another licensee-controlled
document, i.e. FSAR Chapter 16. No changes or physical alterations of the plant are involved. Also, no changes to the
operation of the plant or equipment are involved. Therefore, the proposed changes do not create the possibility of
a new or different kind of accident from any previously evaluated.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
3. Involve a significant reduction in the margin of safety.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The proposed changes involve relocating Technical Specification requirements to the FSAR. The requirements to
be relocated were identified by applying the criteria endorsed in the Commission's Policy Statement. Thus, those
specifications that would be relocated do not impose constraints on design and operation of the plant that are derived
from the plant safety analysis report or from probabilistic safety assessment (PSA) information and do not belong
in the Technical Specifications in accordance with 10 CFR 50.36 and the purpose of the Technical Specifications stated
in the Policy Statement. Therefore, relocation of these requirements does not involve a significant reduction in
the margin of safety.

The proposed amendment would delete the sections describing the On-Site Review Committee (ORC) and the Nuclear Safety
Review Board (NSRB) from the Technical Specifications. This change also removes reference to the Manager, Nuclear
Safety and Emergency Preparedness. Additionally, the change reflects an organizational restructuring which addresses
the Independent Safety Engineering Group (ISEG) reporting to the Manager, Quality Assurance.

Description of amendment request: 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The proposed amendment would modify the technical specifications (TS) to remove instrument response time limit
tables for the reactor protection system (RPS) and isolation actuation and emergency core cooling system (ECCS)
from the TS. The affected instrument response time limit tables would be located in the Final Safety Analysis Report
(FSAR).

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Basis for proposed no significant hazards consideration determination: 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
As required by 10 CFR 50.91(a), the licensee has provided its analysis of the issue of no significant hazards consideration,
which is presented below: 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->
1. Does the change involve a significant increase in the probability or consequences of an accident previously evaluated?
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The RPS, Isolation Actuation and ECCS Instruments provide signals to the actuation logic for safety equipment needed
to mitigate accidents and transients. The proposed change relocates the instrument response times from the Technical
Specifications to the FSAR but will not affect the operability or surveillance requirements of the affected instruments.
The instruments will continue to be proven operable on the schedule provided in the Technical Specifications. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The FSAR change process and Plant Operations Committee review responsibilities ensure that changes to the response
time limits cannot be made without adequate review and approval. Since operability confirmation as required by the
Technical Specifications (surveillance testing requirements) will not be affected by the change and the limits
themselves cannot be altered without adequate review and approval, there is no possibility of a significant increase
in the probability of an accident previously approved as a result of this change.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The instruments provide signals to the actuation logic of equipment used to mitigate the consequences of an accident.
However, since no changes are being made in the methods or frequencies of proving operability the systems will not
be degraded or be made susceptible to degradation that could go unidentified. As discussed above, changes to the limits
will not be made without adequate review and approval. Hence, this change will not affect the capability of the plant
to mitigate a previously evaluated accident. Because the mitigative capability is not affected there is no significant
increase in the consequences of a previously evaluated accident as a result of this change.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
For the above reasons, the change does not represent a significant increase in the probability or consequences of
an accident previously evaluated.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
2. Does the change create the possibility of a new or different kind of accident from any accident previously evaluated?
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The proposed change relocates only the tables containing the instrument response times for the RPS, Isolation Actuation
and ECCS response time limits from the Technical Specifications to the FSAR. The change does not affect how these instruments
will function. Relocation of this information does not represent a change in the configuration or operation of the
plant. No new hardware is being added to the plant as part of the proposed change. Plant procedures are not affected
by the change. The Technical Specification sections for the surveillance testing of these instruments will not be
affected. Therefore, the Technical Specifications will continue to require that the same operability and surveillance
requirements be met for the affected instruments.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Consequently, the possibility of a new or different kind of accident from any accident previously analyzed is not
introduced as a result of this change.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
3. Does the change involve a significant reduction in a margin of safety?
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The margin of safety established by the response time limits is in ensuring that the RPS, Isolation Actuation and ECCS
systems will respond in time to support the assumptions of the accident analysis. Relocating the response time limits
to the FSAR does not alter the operability or the surveillance requirements applicable to the affected instruments.
These instruments will continue to be tested for operability and therefore remain capable of responding to accident
events within the time limits required by the accident analysis. The administrative change control provisions for
the FSAR, the plant procedures implementing the requirements of 10 CFR 50.59 and the administrative sections of the
Technical Specifications are adequate to control changes to the response time limits such that they cannot be altered
in a manner that would adversely affect plant safety.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Therefore, for these reasons, the change does not involve a significant reduction in a margin of safety.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Description of amendment request: 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The proposed amendments consist of two parts: Part one, would revise ``Moderator Temperature Coefficient (MTC)''
Technical Specifications (TSs) to allow the use of a slightly positive MTC for the core design. The licensee has stated
that a positive MTC will reduce the burnable rod requirements and improve operational flexibility. Because of using
a positive MTC, the TSs would be revised to permit a higher boron concentration in the refueling water storage tank,
the reactor coolant system (RCS) accumulators, and the refueling cavity, in order to ensure adequate shutdown margin
is maintained at all times. Part two, would revise the TSs to reduce the required RCS flow to offset any reduction in
flow due to increased steam generator tube plugging. Additionally, the associated Bases for the above TSs would be
revised to describe the basis for the TS requirements.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Because Byron, Unit 1, and Braidwood, Unit 2, will be in refueling outage in the fall of 1994, the proposed TS changes
will apply to them. Byron, Unit 2 and Braidwood, Unit 1 will continue to operate in accordance with the current TSs.
The licensee's submittal identified the appropriate unit applicability of the TSs pertaining to the positive MTC
and the required RCS flows.

Brief description of amendment:

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The amendment revises Technical Specification (TS) 4.4.5.4.a(11) by moving a footnote into the body of the text.
Additionally, Item 3 of TS Section 4.4.5.4.a(11) has been revised to remove the licensee's previous calculation
of primary-to-secondary leakage of 26 gallons per minute (gpm) at the end of 100 calendar days of operation in the present
fuel cycle. In place of this value, the licensee's revised calculated value of less than 9.1 gpm at the end of Cycle 5
is inserted, including a reference to the basis for this revised estimate (i.e; WCAP-14046). Finally, Section 3.4.8.a
is revised to remove the limit on operating time in the present fuel cycle. The maximum permissible dose equivalent
Iodine-131 concentration in the footnote to Section 3.4.8.a remains at 0.35 microcuries per gram of coolant as proposed
by the licensee in its letter dated August 18, 1994. The net result of these revisions is to remove the limitation on
permissible operating time from the Braidwood 1 TSs.

Brief description of amendment: 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The amendment revises Technical Specification 4.7.1.2.1.a to require that the turbine-driven and motor-driven
auxiliary feedwater pumps be tested at least quarterly on a staggered basis instead of the previously required testing
once per 31 days on a staggered basis. The revised surveillance frequency is consistent with the guidance issued in
Generic Letter 93-05, ``Line-Item Technical Specification Improvements to Reduce Surveillance Requirements
for Testing During Power Operation.'' The Bases to TS 3/4.7.7, Emergency Exhaust 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
System - Auxiliary Building, and TS 3/4.9.13, Emergency Exhaust System - Fuel Building, are also revised to eliminate
the reference to the use of automatic control for the emergency exhaust system heaters.

Brief description of amendment: 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The amendment revises Technical Specification Table 3.6-1, ``Containment Isolation Valves,'' by deleting reference
to two (2) valves. The technical specification change reflects a planned modification which removes the essential
service water (ESW) containment air cooler return line isolation valve bypass valves and associated piping.
