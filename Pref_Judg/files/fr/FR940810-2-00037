The Advanced Neutron Source EIS analyzes the siting, construction and operation of a research nuclear reactor [Notice
of Intent, 58 FR 31019]. The Laboratory is being considered as an alternative to the preferred site at DOE's Oak Ridge
Reservation, Tennessee.

The Programmatic Spent Nuclear Fuel Management and INEL Environmental Restoration and Waste Management Programs
EIS includes a programmatic analysis of transporting, processing, and storing spent nuclear reactor fuel [Notice
of Availability, Draft EIS, 59 FR 32688]. The Laboratory has generated spent fuel and continues to temporarily store
this material pending the outcome of programmatic decisions following the spent fuel EIS.

The Department is preparing a site-wide EIS for all activities at its Pantex Plant, near Amarillo, Texas [Notice of
Intent, 59 FR 26635]. The primary mission of this facility is disassembly of nuclear weapons. The Pantex site-wide
EIS will also take a programmatic look at storing disassembled nuclear weapons components. The Laboratory disassembles
and temporarily stores radioisotopic thermoelectric generators (radioactive heat sources) that have been removed
from retired weapons and could be considered as an alternative site for other components.

The Department is preparing a PEIS for Storage and Disposition of Weapons-Usable Fissile Materials [Notice of Intent,
59 FR 31985]. The PEIS will analyze alternatives for the long-term storage and disposition of surplus nuclear materials
in order to minimize the risk of proliferation of nuclear weapons capability in the world. Phase I of the project will
be to provide safe, controlled, inspectable interim storage. As part of this phase, DOE is performing a vulnerability
study to determine the risks associated with current storage of nuclear materials. Phase II will be long-term storage
or disposition of surplus material. Among other things, the PEIS will analyze a new, consolidated long-term storage
facility at five candidate sites (LANL is not a candidate site), and continued use of interim storage facilities.
The Laboratory now stores some nuclear materials.

The Department is preparing a programmatic EA on its proposal to produce medical isotopes for medical applications
such as diagnostics and chemotherapy [EA determination, 02/24/93]. The proposal involves irradiating targets
in a nuclear reactor, processing the material, and disposing of waste. The original proposal was to use the Omega West
Reactor at LANL to produce the isotopes. Since that time, DOE has decided to permanently shut down that reactor, and
it would not be used for this purpose. Alternatives currently under consideration involving LANL facilities would
include fabricating targets at the Chemistry and Metallurgy Research Building, processing and recycling irradiated
material at that facility, and disposing of low-level radioactive waste at LANL's waste management area.

Besides these broad-scale NEPA documents, DOE is in the process of conducting several environmental analyses for
specific proposed projects at LANL or has made preliminary plans to start such reviews. Through this prescoping process,
the public is invited to comment as to whether the NEPA reviews listed in Tables 1 and 2 should precede, be incorporated
into, or be deferred until after the SWEIS. In accordance with requests from the State, tribes, and the public, DOE
invites public comment as to which of these ongoing NEPA reviews should be included within the scope of alternatives
to be analyzed in the SWEIS. Specifically, as requested by the public, DOE invites comments to assist in determining
either: (1) The project has independent justification and would not prejudice the outcome of the SWEIS, and the NEPA
review can proceed; (2) the project is integral to alternatives to be analyzed in the SWEIS, and the NEPA review will
be included in the SWEIS; or (3) the project depends on the outcome of the SWEIS, and the NEPA review will be deferred
until after the SWEIS is completed.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
These projects and DOE's initial recommendations are listed in Table 1. For a few projects, DOE does not make an initial
recommendation but will develop its recommendation after considering public comment. Table 1 also provides information
on the DOE program which sponsors the proposals and the date of the determination of the initial level of NEPA review.
The Department may initiate other projects while the SWEIS is being prepared; Table 2 lists planned projects for which
DOE believes NEPA reviews may be needed prior to completion of the SWEIS but has not yet issued a NEPA determination.
The public is invited to comment on whether these NEPA reviews should proceed independently of the SWEIS, or should
be included in the SWEIS analysis. The NOI will summarize comments received, explain whether or not DOE proposes to
continue with any of these NEPA reviews, and describe their relationship to the alternatives suggested in the NOI.

Issues and alternatives.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The Department has not yet identified environmental issues or suggested alternatives for the SWEIS. These will be
developed over the next few months through the prescoping process with the assistance of stakeholder involvement.
The Department anticipates that alternatives will be issue-driven to allow alternatives to focus on activities
or operations which are of concern (``at issue'') to the agency or the public. The SWEIS would not analyze alternatives
to current practices for which neither the agency nor the public have identified any concerns. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The SWEIS will look at reasonable alternatives to the current situation. The public is specifically invited to comment
on whether analysis of an alternative which would describe phasing out all LANL operations and eventually decommissioning
all facilities (a ``shutdown alternative'') would be useful for comparison to ongoing activities.

In 1976, LANL was designated as one of four National Environmental Research Parks (NERPs). The NERPs were established
to contribute to the understanding of how people can live in balance with nature while enjoying the benefits of technology.
The Department has never instituted an active management plan for the LANL NERP. The public is specifically invited
to comment on whether the SWEIS should contain alternatives for managing the NERP or whether the designation should
be lifted.

The NEPA process. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The DOE NEPA review process is described in the Council on Environmental Quality NEPA regulations [40 CFR Parts 1500&hyph;1508]
and the DOE NEPA regulations [10 CFR Part 1021]. Through NEPA, Congress requires that Federal agencies consider environmental
impacts when making decisions and lay the decisionmaking process open to public scrutiny. An EIS documents the environmental
review of major Federal actions which may significantly affect the human environment; an EA may be used to determine
the need for an EIS or to document that no significant environmental impacts would be expected to occur.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The EIS process begins with publication of a NOI to solicit public comments to assist in determining the scope of analysis
in the EIS [40 CFR 1501.7; 10 CFR 1021.311]. The Department documents the results of the scoping process and its plans
on how to conduct the EIS review in an Implementation Plan [10 CFR 1021.312]. An agency publishes a draft EIS to gain
public input into the environmental analysis before a final EIS is issued [40 CFR 1502.9; 10 CFR 1021.313]. An agency
issues a Record of Decision (ROD) to document its decision and to explain how the environmental considerations documented
in the EIS were balanced against other factors which led to the decision, such as technical, regulatory, or financial
considerations [40 CFR 1505.2; 10 CFR 1021.315].
