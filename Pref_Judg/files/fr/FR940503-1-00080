<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 For purposes of compliance with the reformulated gasoline standards of &sect;80.41, any importer may use a baseline
established for a foreign refinery as the importer's individual baseline, but only for gasoline produced at that
foreign refinery and provided that: 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(1) The Administrator has approved separate 1990 baseline properties and volume for the foreign refinery, as specified
under paragraph (c) of this section; 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(2) The importer is able to establish that the imported gasoline was produced at the foreign refinery, as specified
under paragraph (d) of this section; 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(3) An attest engagement is conducted of the foreign refinery operation for the calendar year during which the separate
foreign refinery baseline is claimed by the importer, as specified under paragraph (e) of this section; and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(4) Authorized representatives of the Administrator are given full and immediate access and are allowed to conduct
inspections, review records and other documents, collect gasoline samples, and perform audits relating to the foreign
refinery, as specified under paragraph (f) of this section.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Establishing individual foreign refinery baselines.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 (1) Any foreign refiner may seek a separate baseline for a foreign refinery by submitting a petition to the Assistant
Administrator of EPA's Office of Air and Radiation, such petition to include the Method 1-, 2-, and/or 3-type data
as specified in &sect;80.91 for the foreign refinery, submitted as specified in &sect;80.93, and verified as specified
in &sect;80.92 except that the baseline auditor shall be an individual who is a United States citizen. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(2) The Assistant Administrator of EPA's Office of Air and Radiation may grant such petition if the properties and
volume of the gasoline produced at the foreign refinery and imported for use in the United States in 1990 are established
to the satisfaction of the Assistant Administrator. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(3) Any petition under this paragraph (c) of this section shall: 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(i) Contain a declaration, signed by the owner or president of the foreign refiner business, that contains the following
language:

The information contained in this individual baseline petition is complete and accurate. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
I agree that any EPA inspector or auditor will be given immediate and complete access to the premises of [the name of
foreign refinery for which an individual baseline is requested], to any other location where gasoline produced at
[the name of the foreign refinery] for use in the United States during the period December 1994 through December 1997
is stored or transported, and to any other location where documents are kept which relate to this baseline petition
or to the quality and/or quantity of the gasoline produced at the foreign refinery for use in the United States during
the period December 1, 1994 through December 31, 1997, regardless of whether these inspections are announced in advance
or are unannounced;

 In order to establish the refinery-of-origin with regard to any batch of imported gasoline: 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(1) The gasoline to which the individual foreign refinery baseline would apply may not be combined with gasoline produced
at any other refinery prior to arrival at the United States port-of-entry; 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(2)(i) A United States-based independent laboratory shall: 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(A) Collect a representative sample of the batch subsequent to loading on the ship that will transport the gasoline
to the United States, and prior to departure of that ship from the port serving the refinery-of-origin; 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(B) Analyze such sample for each property specified in &sect;80.65(e)(1) using the methodologies specified in &sect;80.46;

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(C) Independently determine the volume of the batch; 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(D) Independently determine the refinery at which the subject gasoline was produced, and that the subject gasoline
was not combined with gasoline produced at any other refinery before loading on the ship.
