Some of the changes necessary to comply with a minimum standard may also be incompatible with some of the vehicle characteristics
many consumers seek in vehicles such as sport utility vehicles, vans, motor homes, and campers. For example, in the
case of sport utility vehicles, the capability to operate in off-road conditions may require both high ground clearance
(necessitating a relatively high center of gravity) and narrow width to maneuver in wooded or rocky areas (necessitating
a relatively narrow track width). Section 103(f)(3) of the National Traffic and Motor Vehicle Safety Act provides
that a Federal motor vehicle safety standard must be reasonable and appropriate for each vehicle type to which it applies,
and therefore NHTSA could not mandate a stability requirement incompatible with certain types of vehicles. In addition,
the manufacturers of many of these types of vehicles would be considered small businesses, and a standard could raise
concerns under the Regulatory Flexibility Act.

Another possible cost of a minimum rollover standard is decreased fuel economy. Compact sport utility vehicles have
become popular, in part, because the original sport utility vehicles, which were larger, heavier, and more stable
against rollover, were also more difficult to park and maneuver and had very poor fuel mileage. The compact sport utility
vehicles with higher stability tend to be the larger vehicles in the class, or open vehicles with less mass in the top.
A stability standard would be expected to cause a growth in size and weight of compact sport utility vehicles and a reduction
in fuel mileage.

Based on these estimates of the benefits and costs of a minimum stability standard, NHTSA believes that the benefits
would not be sufficient to justify the expected costs. Therefore, as noted above, NHTSA has decided to defer any further
action on this subject until information becomes available demonstrating the cost effectiveness of such a rule.
The agency may reinitiate such a rulemaking upon receipt of such information. This termination of rulemaking on vehicle
stability fulfills the statutory mandate of Section 2502(b)(2)(B)(i). 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

While the agency is terminating rulemaking on a vehicle stability standard, NHTSA believes that the correlation
between stability and rollover risk is significant enough to justify proposing a consumer information regulation
to relieve the possibility of uninformed risk. The agency's decision to propose such a regulation is explained below.

A. Rationale

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
NHTSA is proposing a new consumer information regulation requiring manufacturers to report the stability metric
of cars and light trucks to enable consumers to make more informed choices concerning the trade-offs of vehicle attributes
and rollover stability. NHTSA believes that a consumer information regulation would inform drivers of general differences
in stability between light trucks and cars, and among vehicles in those classes so that consumers can make an informed
choice concerning relative rollover risk. This regulation would inform drivers who still chose a less stable vehicle
that they may wish to drive more cautiously in certain circumstances and that the higher risk of driving low stability
vehicles can be greatly reduced by using safety belts. In addition, NHTSA believes that a consumer 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
information regulation would motivate manufacturers to give more priority to rollover stability in the design of
new vehicles. NHTSA believes these goals can be accomplished with a minimum burden on industry and consumers. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
NHTSA believes that consumer and manufacturer behavior can be affected through the provision of consumer information.
The agency's experience with the New Car Assessment Program (NCAP) demonstrates the power of consumer information.
Several manufacturers have informed the agency that they have internal goals of performing well in these 35 mph frontal
crash tests, even though there is no regulatory requirement to do so. The lowering of the injury scores over time for
all manufacturers, as reported in ``Report on the Historical Performance of Different Auto Manufacturers in the
New Car Assessment Program Tests'', NHTSA, August 1993, can also be attributed partially to NCAP. The attention of
the media to the program and the more than 20,000 calls annually to NHTSA's Hotline, the most for any NHTSA consumer
information activity, speak to the consumer's interest in relevant consumer safety information. As to whether consumers
want information on rollover, recent agency focus groups indicate they would (``Focus Groups on Traffic Safety Issues:
Public Response to NCAP,'' S.W. Morris &amp; Company, Inc., August 1993, which can be found in Docket No. 79&hyph;17,
Notice 01). The consensus of the focus groups was that the agency's consumer safety information activities should
be expanded to include additional kinds of crashes, including rollover. Consumers also desired point of sale information,
which would be satisfied with the proposed vehicle sticker requirement.
