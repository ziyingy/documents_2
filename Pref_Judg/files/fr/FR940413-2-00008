Respondents argue that the Department's excessive reliance on constructed value (CV) distorted the calculation
of the dumping margins. They contend that the Department should rely on CV as the basis for foreign market value (FMV)
only with respect to U.S. sales for which there are no similar, above-cost, contemporaneous models sold in the third-country
market. They note that 19 U.S.C. 1677b(a)(1) directs the Department to base FMV on home market prices or, if home market
sales are inadequate, third-country prices, unless there are insufficient sales above cost in the appropriate market.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Respondents claim that the Department's use of the ``10/90/10'' test on a product-specific basis is inappropriate
and contrary to the mandate of the antidumping statute because it leads the Department to disregard infrequent below-cost
sales. As respondents explain the test, if between 10 and 90 percent of third-country sales are below cost, the Department
excludes below-cost sales, basing FMV on the remaining above-cost sales. If over 90 percent of third-country sales
are below cost, the Department excludes all third-country sales and bases FMV entirely on CV. Below-cost sales are
included in the calculation of CV if the volume of such sales is less than ten percent. Respondents claim that in past
cases, including the original investigation, the Department has applied the 10/90/10 test on total sales of such
or similar merchandise, and argue that this approach contemplates that, under some circumstances, all sales of certain
models may be below cost because the sales may be of obsolete or end-of-the-year models. They argue that when the test
is applied on a product-specific basis, the sales of such models will almost always be disregarded in calculating
the FMV even though, viewed in the aggregate, they are infrequent in number. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Respondents state that the Department has recently begun applying a two-tiered 10/90/10 system in which first the
Department applies the test, called the ``macro test,'' to total third-country sales; if the macro test indicates
that between 10 and 90 percent of total sales are below cost, the Department then applies a second 10/90/10 test, called
the ``micro test,'' to each individual model sold in the third country. Respondents go on to say that, more recently,
the Department has in several cases applied only the micro test. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Respondents contend that the Department's reliance solely on the micro test is particularly distortive in this proceeding,
because there is frequently only one sale for each individual product. In many instances, therefore, the third-country
product will be either totally above or totally below cost, even though only an insignificant fraction of total third-country
sales may be below cost. They argue that the Department should have used the alternate third-country price data for
the next most similar model in calculating the FMV since they have provided ample third-country price data for the
top three most similar models. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Respondents also contend that the Department, in considering only one particular third-country model as ``such
or similar merchandise,'' compounds its bias for CV. Respondents claim that a large number of physical differences
in sweaters make precise systemization and quantification of such differences for model matching purposes impossible.
Identification of a single best match is, therefore, highly arbitrary. They argue that, by contrast, pricing and
cost are not arbitrary because exporters face the same cost curve and compete based on relative mark-up. They contend
that for their six firms there are, on average, 50 third-country models within a 20 percent cost range for each U.S.
model. Respondents also claim that the Department's refusal to use prices for alternative third-country merchandise
is tantamount to finding that there is only one ``such or similar'' third-country match for each U.S. model. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Respondents ask that for the final results the Department use CV only if there are insufficient above-cost sales of
similar products in the third country. They suggest that the Department implement this method by dropping all below-cost
third-country sales before creating its product concordance, thereby matching U.S. sales only to above-cost third-country
sales.
