Fugitive fly ash/bottom ash emissions from loading ash into trucks or containers can be controlled by ensuring an
adequate moisture content of the ash, either by adding extra moisture (water) or by combining and mixing fly ash with
bottom ash that has passed through a water-filled quench tank. Fugitive fly ash/bottom ash emissions from the ash
loading facility may also be controlled by enclosing the ash loading facility, fitting the truck bays with doors that
can be closed, and discharging the vent air to a control device.

Fugitive fly ash/bottom ash emissions from moving trucks used for hauling ash can be controlled by ensuring that the
ash is moist and that the truck or container is properly sealed and covered during transit. Truck tires can be washed
prior to leaving the ash handling facility to prevent ash from being tracked onto roadways where it can later become
airborne as fugitive fly ash/bottom ash emissions. Additional emissions control can be achieved by reducing ash
spills during loading and by recovering any spilled ash through sweeping, vacuuming, or washing before the spilled
ash can be tracked out of the facility.

Data collected at several MWC's indicate that when the control methods described above are applied in a consistent
and conscientious manner, fugitive fly ash/bottom ash emissions can be controlled so that no visible emissions are
observed from the ash storage facilities, ash transfer points, ash loading to trucks or containers, and trucks hauling
MWC ash.

C. Proposed Fugitive Emissions Standards 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
A standard of no visible fugitive fly ash/bottom ash emissions from ash handling and storage facilities and transfer
points is being proposed and is consistent with the determination that the controls described above represent MACT.
Section 129 of the Act requires that standards for new sources cannot be less stringent than the control achieved in
practice by the best controlled similar source. The controls described above are in place at the ash handling and storage
facilities at many MWC's and are the most stringent available controls for new MWC's. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Therefore, fugitive emission standards are consistent with MACT and are being proposed. Fugitive fly ash/bottom
ash emissions from any MWC ash storage facility or any ash transfer point at an MWC plant with aggregate capacity to
combust greater than 35 Mg/day of MSW would have to be controlled so that no visible emissions shall be detected. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The fly ash/bottom ash visible emission standard will be determined using EPA Reference Method 22 (3-hour continuous
visual observation). Compliance with the visible emissions standards would be determined by an annual performance
test. Reports of initial and annual performance tests would be required. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Any technology may be used to meet these standards. The fly ash/bottom ash fugitive emissions standards would apply
to ash handling facilities within the property boundary of the MWC, but would not apply to offsite transport of ash.

VII. Proposed Standards for Air Curtain Incinerators 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Air curtain incinerators operate by forcefully projecting a curtain of air across the top of an open chamber or pit.
The air curtain reduces emissions during operation by promoting better combustion. Incinerators of this type are
built either above or below ground and typically have refractory walls and a floor. Section 129 of the Act exempts air
curtain incinerators firing MSW from the definition of ``municipal waste combustion unit'' provided that the air
curtain incinerator burns only tree trimmings, yard wastes, and clean untreated lumber, and that it complies with
an opacity limit that would be established by the EPA. As clarified under the proposed NSPS, ``untreated lumber''
means that the lumber has not been painted, pigment-stained, or ``pressure treated.'' 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Today's proposed NSPS includes opacity limits specifically for air curtain incinerators that would combust greater
than 35 Mg/day of yard wastes, tree trimmings, or clean untreated lumber. The proposed opacity limits are 10-percent
opacity (6-minute average), except that a level of up to 35 percent (6-minute average) would be allowed during the
first 30 minutes of operation of the unit. The proposed opacity limits are based on levels achieved by well-designed
and operated air curtain incinerators. Compliance with the proposed air curtain incinerator opacity limits would
be demonstrated by conducting an annual compliance test in accordance with EPA Reference Method 9. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Air curtain incinerators with unit capacities above 35 Mg/day that burn MSW other than yard wastes, tree trimmings,
or clean untreated lumber are covered by the NSPS for MWC's. Air curtain incinerators with unit capacities above 35
Mg/day that burn only yard wastes, tree trimmings, or clean untreated lumber would be subject to the proposed opacity
standard and its associated testing, reporting, and recordkeeping requirements, but would not be subject to any
other parts of the proposed NSPS.

VIII. Comparison of the Proposal and European Emission Limits for MWC's 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Europe is more densely populated than the United States and the combustion of MSW became increasing common after World
War II. Because European countries have more experience combusting MSW, it is interesting to compare the emission
control requirements for MWC's located in the Member States of the European Union (EU) to those for MWC's in the United
States. In addition to comparing emission requirements, the EPA also compared the prevalence of waste combustion
in the United States and the EU.
