Nevertheless, there is concern over the potential health and safety issues posed by 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
methylene chloride. In fact, due to these concerns, some local and regional restrictions apply 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
to the use of methylene chloride. To assess these risks in the application under discussion, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
EPA used data collected by the Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA) for 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the proposed revision of the permissible exposure level (PEL) for methylene chloride. The 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Agency's estimate for total population risk for methylene chloride was based on average plant 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
emissions derived from OSHA's analysis, and while not negligible, was within the range of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
existing Agency decisions on acceptable risk. For further detail, refer to the background 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
document entitled ``Risk Screen on the Use of Substitutes for Class I Ozone-Depleting 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Substances: Foams''. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In light of the results of Agency analysis, EPA decided to find acceptable the use of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
methylene chloride subject to existing or future restrictions because it will allow immediate 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
transition from class I substances in this end-use. Potential users should note that methylene 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
chloride use will be subject to future controls for hazardous air pollutants under Title III 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
section 112 of the CAA. In addition, use of the compound must conform to all relevant 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
workplace safety standards; OSHA has proposed permissible exposure levels (PELs) for 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
methylene chloride of 25 ppm on a time-weighted average (TWA). Once such additional 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
controls have been adopted, use of this substitute must comply with any other applicable 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
requirements, such as state restrictions. Use is also subject to waste disposal requirements 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
under RCRA. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(b) Acetone. Acetone (or blends thereof) is acceptable as a blowing agent for flexible polyurethane 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
foams. In those areas where methylene chloride use is deemed unacceptable, acetone may 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
provide another non-ODP alternative to CFC&hyph;11 and methyl chloroform. All grades of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
flexible polyurethane foam produced with CFCs can be produced using acetone as an 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
auxiliary blowing agent. Acetone does not have an ozone depletion potential, and its global 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
warming potential is negligible. Nevertheless, acetone is highly flammable and its use 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
requires precautions to ensure safety to workers as prescribed by OSHA. In addition, use of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
this compound is subject to various federal, state, or local controls as a VOC under Title I of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the CAA. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(c) HFC&hyph;134a. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
HFC&hyph;134a (or blends thereof) is acceptable as a substitute for CFC&hyph;11 in flexible 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
polyurethane foam. HFC&hyph;134a is a non-ozone-depleting alternative to CFC&hyph;11 blowing agents 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
in flexible polyurethane foam. Plant modifications may be necessary to accommodate the use 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
of HFC&hyph;134a because its boiling point is lower than that of CFC&hyph;11. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(d) HFC&hyph;152a. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
HFC&hyph;152a (or use thereof) is acceptable as a substitute for CFC&hyph;11 in flexible 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
polyurethane foam. HFC&hyph;152a is a non-ozone-depleting alternative to CFC&hyph;11 blowing agents 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
in flexible polyurethane foam. Process changes may be necessary to accommodate the use of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
HFC&hyph;152a, and plant modifications may be necessary to manage its flammability. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(e) AB Technology. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
AB Technology is acceptable as an alternative process in flexible polyurethane foams. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The AB Technology generates carbon monoxide as the chemical blowing agent. Precautions 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
should be taken to insure the safety of workers from exposure to elevated levels of carbon 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
monoxide, particularly at the latter phases of production where ventilation is generally not as 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
efficient as on the foam line. OSHA has set a permissible exposure level (PEL) for carbon 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
monoxide of 35 ppm on a time-weighted average (TWA) with a ceiling of 200 ppm. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(f) Carbon dioxide. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Carbon dioxide (or blends thereof) is an acceptable alternative process in flexible 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
polyurethane foams. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(8) Polyurethane integral skin foams. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(a) HCFC&hyph;123. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
HCFC&hyph;123 (or blends thereof) is acceptable as an alternative to CFC&hyph;11 in integral 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
skin foams. The physical and chemical properties of HCFC&hyph;123 are similar to CFC&hyph;11. As a 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
result, HCFC&hyph;123, which has an ozone depleting potential significantly lower than that of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
CFC&hyph;11, has the potential to replace CFC&hyph;11 in many integral skin applications. Nonetheless, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
commercial availability of HCFC&hyph;123 is limited at present. The use of HCFC&hyph;123 in integral 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
skin foams is subject to significant restriction under section 610 of the CAA, which bans the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
use of class II substances in noninsulating foams after January 1, 1994. The ban exempts 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
only certain integral skin foams used to provide for motor vehicle safety. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(b) HCFC&hyph;141b. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
HCFC&hyph;141b (or blends thereof) is acceptable as an alternative to CFC&hyph;11 in integral 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
skin foams. Although its ODP of 0.11 is relatively high, HCFC&hyph;141b offers an acceptable 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
transition substitute out of CFC&hyph;11 in integral skin foams. The use of HCFC&hyph;141b in integral 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
skin foams, however, is subject to significant restriction under section 610 of the CAA, which 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
banned the use of class II substances in noninsulating foams after January 1, 1994. The ban 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
exempts only certain integral skin foams used to provide for motor vehicle safety. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(c) HCFC&hyph;22. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
HCFC&hyph;22 (or blends thereof) is acceptable as a substitute for CFC&hyph;11 in integral skin 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
foam. HCFC&hyph;22 offers an alternative with significantly less potential to deplete ozone than 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
CFC&hyph;11. However, process changes may be necessary to accommodate the low boiling point 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
of HCFC&hyph;22. The use of HCFC&hyph;22 in integral skin foams is subject to significant restrictions 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
under section 610 of the CAA, which banned the use of class II substances in noninsulating 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
foams after January 1, 1994. The ban exempts only certain integral skin foams used to 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
provide for motor vehicle safety.
