7. Describe any trade-off for the design of the vehicle with cost that would dictate an upper limit of driving range
for economic practicability.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
8. Discuss reduction in vehicle driving range due to climate control energy demand. Discuss any new technology utilized
in vehicle design and in advanced heating and cooling approaches to mitigate range reduction.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
9. Describe how the weight/size of the battery pack will affect the driving range on dual fueled electric passenger
cars. What determines this result?
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
10. Does the specific driving range of dual fueled electric cars create any environmental impacts that could be mitigated
by choosing a different range or battery capacity? Please discuss the basis for your answer (e.g., (1) setting the
minimum driving range so high that manufacturers could meet it only with battery technologies that employ more harmful
chemicals, (2) setting the minimum driving range so high that manufacturers would be discouraged from trying to meet
it, or so low that consumers wouldn't buy it, thus delaying the development or use of these cleaner technologies, and
(3) setting the minimum driving range so low that the consumer would frequently be forced to use the more polluting
non-electric fuel.)
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
11. For longer driving range on electric power, please discuss any significant safety or fire problems for the occupants
of the dual fueled car or any object with which the car may collide. Is there an optimum battery capacity that would minimize
potential safety problems for the electrolyte spillage, shock or fire? Please explain your answer.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
12. Would the driveability (i.e., handling and performance) of a dual fueled electric car be penalized by a requirement
for a driving range comparable to that for typical gasoline-fueled cars? Can an optimum driving range standard for
dual fueled electric vehicles be established from driveability considerations? Please explain your answer.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
13. Is it likely that dual fueled electric passenger car applications may have decreased performance capabilities
when powered by electricity (e.g., predominately city driving, acceleration, top speed, and gradeability limit)
and consequently result in lower consumer expectations for driving range. Please discuss your answer.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
14. How do style or appearance considerations affect the space for the batteries and, therefore, minimum driving
range? How will minimum driving range limit the storage space in the trunk of the vehicle?
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
15. What other factors, if any, should the agency consider in establishing the driving ranges for dual fueled electric
passenger cars when operated on electricity?
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
16. What do you recommend as the minimum driving range for dual fueled electric passenger cars when operating on electricity?
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
17. What safety problems could arise if both battery acid and the second fuel spilled and mixed during an accident?
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
18. What kinds of range extenders are manufacturers considering for use in dual fueled electric vehicles (e.g., flywheels,
hydraulic accumulators, small range heat engines, fuel cell systems, etc.)?
