E. Grantee Share of the Project 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Grantees must provide at least 20 percent of the total approved cost of the project. The total approved cost of the project
is the sum of the ACF share and the non-Federal share. The non-Federal share may be met by cash or in-kind contributions;
although applicants are encouraged to meet their match requirements through cash contributions. Therefore, a project
requesting $300,000 in Federal funds must include a match of at least $75,000 (20% total project cost). 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
While we encourage applicants to secure non-Federal funds for their match, the non-Federal share may be satisfied
through other Federal funding sources, provided the other Federal program source relates to the proposed ANA project,
as follows: 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
&bull;Indian Child Welfare funds, through the Department of Interior; 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
&bull;Indian Self-Determination and Education Assistance funds, through the Department of Interior and the Department
of Health and Human Services; and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
&bull;Community Development Block Grant funds, through the Department of Housing and Urban Development. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
An itemized budget detailing the applicant's non-Federal share, and its source, must be included in an application.
A request for a waiver of the non-Federal share requirement may be submitted in accordance with 45 CFR 1336.50(b)(3)
of the Native American Program Regulations.

F. Review Criteria 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
A proposed project should reflect the purposes of ANA's SEDS policy and program goals (described in the Background
section of this competitive area), include a social and economic development strategy which reflects the needs and
specific circumstances of the local community, and address the specific developmental steps that the tribe or Native
American community is undertaking toward self-sufficiency. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The evaluation criteria are closely related to each other and are considered as a whole in judging the overall quality
of an application. Points are awarded only to applications which are responsive to this competitive area and these
criteria. Proposed projects will be reviewed on a competitive basis using the following evaluation criteria: 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Long-range goals and available resources.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 (15 points) (a) The application explains how specific social, governance and economic long-range community goals
relate to the proposed project and strategy. It explains how the community intends to achieve these goals. It documents
the type of involvement and support of the community in the planning process and implementation of the proposed project.
The goals are described within the context of the applicant's comprehensive community social and economic development
plan. (Inclusion of the community's entire development plan is not necessary). The application has a clearly delineated
social and economic development strategy (SEDS).

(b) Available resources (other than ANA and the non-Federal share) which will assist, and be coordinated with the
project are described. These resources should be documented by letters or documents of commitment of resources,
not merely letters of support. ``Letters of support'' merely express another organization's endorsement of a proposed
project. Support letters are not binding commitment letters or documents that factually establish the authenticity
of other resources. Letters and other documents of commitment are binding in that they specifically state the nature,
amount and conditions under which another agency or organization will support a project funded with ANA monies. For
example, a letter from another Federal agency or foundation pledging a commitment of $200,000 in construction funding
to complement proposed ANA funded pre-construction activity is evidence of a firm funding commitment. These resources
may be human, natural or financial, and may include other Federal and non-Federal resources. Applicant statements
that additional funding will be sought from other specific sources is
