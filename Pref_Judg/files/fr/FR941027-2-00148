Potential applicants frequently direct questions to officials of the Department regarding application notices
and programmatic and administrative regulations governing various direct grant programs. To assist potential
applicants the Department has assembled the following most commonly asked questions. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Q. Can we get an extension of the deadline? 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
A. No. A closing date may be changed only under extraordinary circumstances. Any change must be announced in the

 and apply to all applications. Waivers for individual applications cannot be granted regardless of the circumstances.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Q. How many copies of the application should I submit and must they be bound? 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
A. Our new policy calls for an original and six copies to be submitted. The binding of applications is optional. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Q. May we use this same application to compete for funds under a different grant program? 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
A. Yes, however, the likelihood of success is not good. A properly prepared application must meet the specifications
of the grant program to which it is submitted. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Q. I'm not sure which grant program is most appropriate for my project. What should I do? 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
A. We are happy to provide general program information. Clearly, it would not be appropriate for staff to participate
in the actual writing of an application, but we can respond to specific questions about application requirements,
evaluation criteria, and the priorities. Applicants should understand that this previous contact is not required,
nor will it in any way influence the success of an application. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Q. When will I find out if I'm going to be funded? 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
A. You can expect to receive notification within 3 to 4 months of the application closing date, depending on the number
of applications received and the number of grant programs with closing dates at about the same time. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Q. Once my application has been reviewed by the review panel, can you tell me the outcome? 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
A. No. Every year we are called by a number of applicants who have legitimate reasons for needing to know the outcome
of the review prior to official notification. Some applicants need to make job decisions, some need to notify a local
school district, etc. Regardless of the reason, because final funding decisions have not been made at that point,
we cannot share information about the review with anyone. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Q. Will my application be returned if I am not funded? 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
A. We no longer return unsuccessful applications. Thus applicants should retain at least one copy of the application.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Q. Can I obtain copies of reviewers' comments?
