It is important to clarify two related points on this issue. Since any individual who declares, under penalty of perjury,
that he or she is a United States citizen is not required to submit proof of citizenship, no documentation requirements
are imposed upon a person with disabilities (or anyone else) who is a U.S. citizen. Similarly, any person with disabilities
who (1) is a noncitizen, (2) is 62 years of age or older or will be 62 years of age by the time he or she is required to submit
evidence of eligible status, and (3) is receiving HUD assistance on the effective date of this final rule, is exempt
from the rule's requirements to submit evidence of immigration status. This person only would be required to submit,
in addition to the declaration, a proof of age document. As a result, even though there is no specific exemption for
persons with disabilities under this rule, it is still possible that a person with disabilities may not have to submit
immigration status documentation because of the rule's own general exemptions.

2. Persons Other Than Citizens and Certain Elderly Persons Are Not Exempt From Documentation Requirements 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
One commenter argued that the statutory provision establishing the statutory documentation requirements does
not apply to applicants because section 214(d) requires immigration documents to be submitted by individuals who
are, among other things, ``receiving financial assistance on the date of the enactment of the Housing and Community
Development Act of 1987.'' (As noted in the discussion under section VII.A. of this preamble, in both the 1988 and 1994
proposed rules, HUD replaces the term ``date of enactment'' of the 1987 Act with ``effective date of final rule.'')

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Since applicants for HUD assistance could not have been ``receiving financial assistance on February 5, 1988'' (the
date of enactment of the 1987 Act), the commenter contends that applicants do not need to submit documents verifying
citizenship or eligible immigration status until they actually become recipients. Consequently, this commenter
asked HUD to include in the rule a prohibition against the removal of any applicant's name from a waiting list based
upon a failure to verify immigration status with the INS. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
HUD disagrees with this interpretation. The 1987 Act amended section 214 to provide that: 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG QTAG 04 -->
<!-- PJG /QTAG -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->
If such an individual is not a citizen or national of the United States, is not 62 years of age or older, and is receiving
financial assistance on the date of the enactment of the Housing and Community Development Act of 1987, there must
be presented either *&blank;*&blank;* (alien registration documents or other documents acceptable to HUD). (42

HUD has construed this language to mean that only two classes of individuals are exempt from the immigration documentation
requirements: (1) Those who declare themselves to be U.S. citizens or nationals; and (2) noncitizens who are or will
be 62 years of age by the time they are required to submit immigration documents, and who were receiving HUD financial
assistance on the effective date of this final rule. This second category of persons, however, would be required to
present proof of age. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The commenter proposes that HUD establish an additional exemption for all applicants to assisted housing. Again,
under this interpretation, the documentation requirements would not be triggered until the applicant becomes a
tenant ``receiving financial assistance.'' HUD believes that there is no legal basis for adopting this interpretation
of the 1987 Act. There is no evidence in the 1987 Act that the documentation requirements of section 214 were intended
to apply only to tenants. To the contrary, the 1987 Act contains other provisions that support that the documentation
requirements were intended to cover applicants as well. (See, for example, 42 U.S.C. 1436a(d)(4)(A)(ii) and 1436a(d)(4)(B)(ii),
which prohibit HUD from delaying, denying, reducing or terminating an individual's eligibility for financial assistance
pending INS verification or appeal.)

Clearly, the Congress intended the SAVE system to be used to verify the immigration status of applicants to assisted
housing, and not to delay this process until after the applicant became a tenant receiving HUD assistance. Consequently,
the 1994 proposed rule does not revise the 1988 proposed rule's interpretation of this statutory language.

Two commenters urged HUD to consider an alternative interpretation concerning the elderly exemption, one which
would exempt from the rule's documentation requirements any individual who not only is 62 years of age or older and
receiving HUD financial assistance on the effective date of the final rule, but an individual who is receiving HUD
financial assistance on the effective date of the final rule, and who will be 62 years of age by the time he or she is required
to submit evidence of eligible status. This revision would provide individuals with a longer period of time in which
to qualify under the elderly exemption. HUD agrees that this is the preferable statutory interpretation, and is consistent
with Congressional intent concerning the protections to be provided to persons already receiving assistance and
elderly persons. Accordingly, the 1994 proposed rule contains this interpretation. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Another commenter on the ``elderly exemption,'' advocated that the exemption apply to both current tenants of HUD-assisted
housing, and ``to future applicants who are elderly.'' Citing from the House Committee Report on H.R. 4 (H.R. Rep.
No. 100&hyph;122, 100th Cong., 1st Sess. 49 (1987)), the commenter contended that Congress meant to exclude from
the rule's documentation requirements 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
all
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 elderly individuals, and not just those who were receiving financial assistance on the effective date of HUD's final
rule. The commenter quoted from page 50 of the House Committee Report:

Elderly persons 62 years or older would only have to certify, and would not have to provide documentation establishing
their immigration status or nationality.

While it is true that the House version of the 1987 Act would have extended the elderly exemption to all persons 62 years
of age or older, this language was modified prior to passage of the bill. Under section 164(c)(1) of the 1987 Act, as
passed (101 Stat. 1861), the Congress narrowed the exemption to apply only to an individual who is ``*&blank;*&blank;*&blank;
62 years of age or older, and (who) is receiving financial assistance on the date of the enactment of the Housing and
Community Development Act of 1987.'' 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
As discussed above, HUD construes this language to mean that the elderly exemption applies only to individuals who
are or will be 62 years of age by the time they would be required to submit evidence of eligible status, and who are receiving
HUD financial assistance on the effective date of the final rule. Accordingly, HUD has not adopted the suggested modification
in the 1994 proposed rule.

3. Submission of Original Documentation 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
One commenter argued that elderly persons would be unable to produce original records proving their age in the time
period allowed by the proposed regulations. HUD notes that the 1988 proposed rule did not provide any time limit for
the submission of documents, including documents establishing an individual's age. With regard to the documentation
that is needed to establish an individual's age (i.e., the types of acceptable documents, and whether original documents
must be submitted or whether some alternative procedure is permissible), the 1994 proposed rule does not prescribe
acceptable documentation. Responsible entities will continue to follow existing procedures used in the various
assisted housing programs to document age (i.e., to document that a person is an ``elderly person''). HUD also notes
that most individuals who are 62 years of age or older will have readily available the documents establishing age since
those documents are needed to obtain social security benefits, and other benefits provided by communities (e.g.,
discounts for senior citizens).
