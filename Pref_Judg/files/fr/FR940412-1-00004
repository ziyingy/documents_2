Form I&hyph;185 (CBCC) is issued to Canadian citizens or lawful permanent residents of Canada having a common nationality
with Canada and is intended to facilitate the entry of those individuals into the United States. Since these groups
are automatically waived passport and visa requirements when crossing the border into the United States, Form I&hyph;185
is normally issued in conjunction with an approved waiver of excludability pursuant to section 212(d)(3)(B) of the
Act. Form I&hyph;185 therefore serves as evidence of a long-term waiver of inadmissibility for the holder of the document.
Currently, no fee is charged for this benefit, although each application requires substantial time to adjudicate
and provides a clear benefit to the applicant by eliminating the need for a yearly waiver application.

Form I&hyph;586 (BCC), and its former version Form I&hyph;186, offer the same privileges as the B&hyph;1/B&hyph;2
visa. The issuance of BCCs is a benefit which the Service performs voluntarily. No law or regulation requires the Service
to issue this document, which is an extremely desirable benefit to many Mexican nationals. Possession of the BCC allows
access to the area within 25 miles of the border for periods not to exceed 72 hours without the need for further documentation
upon each entry. With the issuance of other documentation, the BCC also allows travel to all parts of the United States
without the need to obtain a nonimmigrant visa and passport. The existing Agreement on Passports/Visas (Treaty)
between the United States and Mexico currently prohibits charging a fee for the initial issuance of a BCC. However,
the treaty does not specifically preclude charging a fee for replacement cards. The application process for replacement
is identical to the application for initial issuance, placing a significant demand on personnel resources. Institution
of a fee for the application for issuance of a replacement Form I&hyph;586 will help to make the process financially
self-supporting and substantially expedite issuance of the card.

In accordance with 5 U.S.C. 605(b), the Commissioner of the Immigration and Naturalization Service certifies that
this rule will not have a significant adverse economic impact on a substantial number of small entities. The fees proposed
in this rule, calculated to cover only the costs of providing the service, are nominal, and will apply only to individuals,
not small entities. This rule is not significant within the meaning of section 3(f) of Executive Order 12866, nor does
this rule have Federalism implications warranting the preparation of a Federalism Assessment in accordance with
Executive Order 12612.
