<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
One of the major difficulties in risk assessment is estimating exposure parameters and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the dose or body burden actually absorbed by the individual. In epidemiologic studies, the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
actual absorption and bioavailability of a chemical from an exposure are frequently unknown. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Measurement of chemical concentrations in biologic fluids or tissues is one way to 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
measure more precisely the concentration at the site(s) of toxic effect. In epidemiologic 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
studies, this has been possible only for chronic exposure and for acute exposure to chemicals 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
with long biologic half-lives in the body, such as lead, other metals, and bromides. Blood 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
lead levels show correlations with neurobehavioral impairment, but blood lead levels are 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
representative correlates of toxicity only for relatively acute doses. In children, for example, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the majority of lead-related impairment is the result of chronic, rather than acute, absorption. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The cumulative amount of lead sequestered in tissues (such as deciduous teeth) may be a 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
more representative indicator of the area under the time-concentration curve. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
For chemicals with half-lives in the body too short for estimating absorbed dose, the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
biochemical products from the chemical or from the physiologic effects of the chemical may 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
serve as an index of exposure. Serum enzyme concentrations (cholinesterase) and esterases 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
in other tissues (lymphocyte target esterase) have been employed in field studies to detect 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
pesticide exposure, while vanillylmandelic acid (product of catecholamine neurotransmitter 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
biotransformation) and erythrocyte protoporphyrin concentrations have been used with 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
varying success in differentiating between lead-exposed and control workers. The addition of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
similar ``exposure biomarker'' measures to laboratory studies may allow the development of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
quantitative estimates of absorbed dose under various exposure conditions. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The measurement of metabolic products of neurotoxic agents may be extremely useful 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
in risk assessment; an example comes from cancer risk assessment. Human data from the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
early 1970s on saturation of microsomal methylene chloride biotransformation to carbon 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
monoxide (Stewart et al., 1972), along with subsequent animal carcinogenesis data garnered 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
in the 1980s, provided a quantitative basis for a physiologically based pharmacokinetic model 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
of methylene chloride cancer risk assessment (Andersen et al., 1991). The information on 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
human CO pathway kinetics provided the homologous key that allowed extrapolation of risk 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
from animals to humans on a comparative physiologic basis rather than using default 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
assumptions.

3.3.4. Imaging Techniques 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
A number of recently developed computerized imaging techniques for evaluating brain 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
activity and cerebral/peripheral blood flow have added valuable information to the neurologic 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
diagnostic process. These imaging methods include thermography, positron emission 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
tomography, passive neuromagnetic imaging (magnetoencephalography), magnetic resonance 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
imaging, magnetic resonance spectroscopy, computerized tomography, doppler 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
ultrasonography, and computerized EEG recording/analysis (brain electrical activity 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
mapping). The research application of these invasive and noninvasive quantitative methods 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
has primarily been in neurology, schizophrenia research, drug abuse, AIDS research and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
toxic encephalopathy (Hagstadius et al., 1989). Although the equipment for brain imaging is 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
expensive and not portable, neuroimaging techniques promise to be valuable clinical and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
laboratory research tools in human neurotoxicology.

3.3.5. Neuropathologic Methods 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Neuropathologic examination of nervous system tissue has been used to confirm data 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
from clinical testing and to contribute to the understanding of mechanisms of action of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
neurotoxicity. Peripheral nerve biopsies have confirmed chemically induced peripheral 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
neuropathies and evaluated rates of recovery (Fullerton, 1969). Postmortem examination of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
nervous tissue also has elucidated the neuropathological effects of carbon disulfide, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
clioquinol, and doxorubicin (Spencer and Schaumburg, 1980).

3.3.6. Self-Report Assessment Methods 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Self-report measures relevant to neurotoxicity risk assessment consist of histories of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
symptoms, events, behaviors, and environmental conditions. Information is obtained by 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
face-to-face interviews, structured interviews (often conducted for diagnostic purposes), 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
medical histories, questionnaires, and survey instruments. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Self-report instruments are the only means for measuring some symptoms and all 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
interoceptive states, such as pain and nausea. Self-reports also are used to obtain information 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
on behaviors and events (e.g., exposure conditions) especially when practical, legal, or 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
ethical limitations prevent direct observation. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Subjective symptoms elucidated from self-report instruments are responsive to dose. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Hanninen et al. (1979) found that subjective symptoms were positively correlated with blood 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
lead levels in exposed workers. Subjective pain estimations are correlated with dose and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
type of centrally and peripherally acting analgesics, and anxiety scores on a variety of scales 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
are responsive to the size of the anxiolytic dose.
