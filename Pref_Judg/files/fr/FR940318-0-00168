Appendix B at the end of this Preamble lists in tabular form the Agency's 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
determinations on substitutes in the cleaning sector. These listings are based on the risk 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
screens described in the background document entitled ``Risk Screen on the Use of Substitutes 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
for Class I Ozone-Depleting Substances: Solvent Cleaning'' and discussed in associated 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
supporting memoranda. The table includes as ``pending'' a few substitutes for which the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Agency has not yet issued determinations. Vendors or users of cleaning substitutes not 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
described in appendix B should submit information on these uses, so that the Agency can 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
review them and issue a SNAP determination. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The three major end uses that in the past employed CFC&hyph;113 and MCF are metals 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
cleaning, electronics cleaning, and precision cleaning. Metals cleaning applications usually 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
involve removing cutting oils and residual metal filings. This sector relies principally on 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
MCF as a cleaning solvent. In contrast, the electronics industry uses principally CFC&hyph;113, for 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
instance, to remove flux residues left after mounting parts on printed circuit boards. Precision 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
cleaning also uses mostly CFC&hyph;113. This last application comprises a broad category of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
industrial cleaning operations and can cover uses ranging from preparation of pacemakers to 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
manufacture of direct access storage devices (DASDs) for computers. The following sections 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
present substitutes for CFC&hyph;113 and MCF in these three end uses and discuss the acceptability 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
listings presented in appendix B.

a. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Hydrochlorofluorocarbons (HCFCs). 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
HCFC&hyph;141b or HCFC&hyph;141b blends with alcohols are the principal HCFC alternative 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
solvents to CFC&hyph;113/MCF cleaning. These alternatives can be used in vapor degreasing 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
equipment, principally for electronics or precision cleaning, and in some cases existing CFC&hyph;113 or MCF equipment
can be retrofitted for use with HCFC&hyph;141b alternatives. From an 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
environmental standpoint, the critical characteristic of HCFC&hyph;141b is that it has a relatively 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
high ODP_0.11_the highest of all the HCFCs. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Another HCFC, HCFC&hyph;123, is generally not considered to have widespread application 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
as a cleaner. Although this HCFC has the capacity to remove many soils, it is such an 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
aggressive cleaner that it frequently degrades the surface of the part being cleaned. The 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
company-set AEL for HCFC&hyph;123 was recently raised from 10ppm to 30ppm based on new 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
toxicity findings. These new data mean that the exposure limit could be met with existing 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
equipment, and the Agency intends to list HCFC&hyph;123 under separate rule-making as 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
acceptable subject to adherence to the exposure limit. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
HCFC&hyph;225, a third HCFC, is widely viewed as having potential as a cleaning agent, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
especially for manufacture and maintenance of precision parts and equipment. However, this 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
chemical is not yet in widespread production or use and is only now starting to be 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
commercially available. Preliminary toxicity findings suggest that of the two HCFC&hyph;225 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
isomers, HCFC&hyph;225ca and HCFC&hyph;225cb, toxicity concerns associated with the ca-isomer may 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
warrant a comparatively low company-set occupational exposure limit. As a result, EPA 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
intends under separate rule-making to propose HCFC&hyph;225 as acceptable subject to adherence 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
to this limit. The Agency anticipates that companies will readily be able to meet this 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
requirement since the ca-isomer is sold commercially in a blend with the less toxic cb-isomer. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In addition, equipment using HCFC&hyph;225 is usually designed for precision operations and has 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
inherently low emissions. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
b. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Semi-aqueous cleaners. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Semi-aqueous cleaners are alternatives for cleaning in all three sectors. These cleaners 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
employ hydrocarbons/surfactants either emulsified in water solutions or applied in 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
concentrated form and then rinsed with water. Since both approaches involve water as part of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the formulation, the system is commonly referred to as ``semi-aqueous.'' The principal 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
categories of chemicals used in these formulations are terpenes, C6&hyph;C20 petroleum 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
hydrocarbons (both naturally or synthetically derived), or oxygenated organic solvents (such 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
as alcohols). An extensive discussion of various semi-aqueous cleaning alternatives may be 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
found in the Industry Cooperative for Ozone Layer Protection (ICOLP) documents on the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
subject. Users can obtain these documents from the EPA. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
c. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Aqueous cleaners. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Aqueous cleaners, unlike semi-aqueous, uses water as the primary solvent. These 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
formulations are used mostly for metals cleaning, but companies are beginning to explore 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
options using these substitutes in other cleaning applications. In aqueous formulations, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
detergents and surfactants are combined in water with a variety of additives such as organic 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
solvents (e.g., high-boiling point alcohols), builders, saponifiers, inhibitors, emulsifiers, pH 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
buffers and antifoaming agents. The cleaning process is comparable to that used in semiaqueous applications and
consists of combinations of a wash phase, a rinse phase, and a 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
drying phase. An important difference is that the wash tank is frequently heated to improve 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
soil removal. The final step, drying, is separate from the cleaning step and can be 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
accomplished by use of heat or a drying agent. These alternatives are discussed extensively 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
in the ICOLP documents. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
d.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Straight organic solvent cleaning. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Organic solvents can be used to replace CFC&hyph;113 and MCF in certain cleaning 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
operations. This classification is defined to include terpenes, C6&hyph;C20 petroleum hydrocarbons 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(both naturally and synthetically derived), and oxygenated organic solvents such as alcohols, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
ethers (including propylene glycol ethers), esters and ketones. These compounds are 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
commonly used in solvent tanks at room temperature, although the solvents can also be used 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
in-line cleaning systems or be heated to increase solvency power. If heated, the solvents must 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
be used in equipment designed to control vapor losses.
