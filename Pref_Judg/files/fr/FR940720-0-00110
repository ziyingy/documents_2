For the final rule, EPA has decided that a ``locomotive'' means a self-propelled piece of on-track equipment (other
than equipment designed for operation both on highways and rails, specialized maintenance equipment, and other
similar equipment) designed for moving other equipment, freight or passenger traffic. EPA has also decided that
the term ``engines used in locomotives'' means either an engine placed in the locomotive to move other equipment,
freight, or passenger traffic, or an engine mounted on the locomotive to provide auxiliary power.

1. Introduction 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
EPA is defining farm equipment as any internal combustion engine-powered machine primarily used in the commercial
production and/or harvesting of food, fiber, wood, or commercial organic products or for the processing of such products
for further use on the farm. EPA is defining construction equipment as any internal combustion engine-powered machine
primarily used in construction and located on commercial construction sites. Many types of equipment are used almost
exclusively for farming and construction (
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
e.g.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
, tractors and bulldozers). In the case of such equipment, the applicability of EPA's definition is clear: they are
farm or construction equipment and thus preempted from state regulation. Other types of equipment, however, are
used not only for farming or construction, but for other purposes as well (
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
e.g.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
, pumps used for irrigation and swimming pools). The issue thus arises whether or not such multi-purpose equipment
should be considered farm or construction equipment and thus preempted from state regulation.

2. EPA's Proposal 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
In the NPRM, EPA proposed a ``primary use'' test to assess whether state regulation of multiple use equipment would
be preempted. EPA proposed that in order for state regulation to be preempted, equipment must be ``primarily used''_used
51 percent_as farm or construction equipment. Under this test, for example, a compressor used 51 percent in farming
or construction applications would be preempted from state regulation. EPA proposed 51 percent as a reasonable use
cut-off point because it corresponds to a bare ``majority''. EPA believed that the preempted category would be unreasonably
expanded if state regulation could be preempted simply because a small fraction of such equipment was used in farm
or construction applications.

3. Comments on and Alternatives to EPA's Proposal 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
During the comment period following the hearing EPA received comments from industry and CARB opposing the primary
use test. EMI, EMA, PPEMA, Industrial Truck Association (ITA), Construction Industry Air Quality Coalition (CIAQC),
and Ingersoll-Rand Company stated that the primary use test is unauthorized and should not be employed. They stated
that the plain meaning of the preemption provision does not permit EPA to apply a percentage test to determine if equipment
is farm or construction equipment. Congress, they contended, meant to preempt state regulation of all nonroad engines
used in farm or construction equipment, even if only a small fraction of the equipment is represented in these preempted
categories. CIMA commented that the proposed test would be unworkable because the data on which to base a primary use
finding are unavailable, and Deere and Company and others similarly stated that accurate data cannot be obtained,
in part because of the rental market. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
On the other side of the issue, CARB argued that the 51 percent primary use test is contrary to Congressional intent.
CARB noted that it is unlikely that Congress intended to so limit California's authority to control emissions from
nonroad sources given the broad waiver of federal preemption it provides California in the area of motor vehicle emission
control. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
CARB initially supported a position that equipment should be defined as farm or construction equipment only if more
than 75 percent of the equipment is used in farming or construction. CARB noted, in its comments supporting a 75 percent
cutoff, that this would ensure that state regulation would be preempted only for equipment primarily used on farm
or construction sites. Commenters submitted alternative proposals. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
EMA and the Outdoor Power Equipment Institute (OPEI) proposed that EPA should define the scope of preemption in terms
of the primary use of the engine family, not the equipment. EMA proposed that the Agency consider preempting for state
regulation any engine line ``used in'' farm or construction equipment regardless of the extent which the engine line
is used in other types of equipment. CARB and MECA both commented that only regulation of the individual engines actually
used in farm or construction equipment should be preempted. CARB also proposed that preemption apply only to regulation
of engines exclusively designed for and used in the farm and construction industries. Failing that, both CARB and
MECA believed that the 51 percent test for determining how equipment was primarily used was too low. CARB recommended
that state regulation of multiple-use equipment be preempted only if more than 75 percent of the equipment is used
in farming or construction. CARB noted that this would ensure that any preempted equipment was primarily used on farms
or at construction sites. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
PPEMA proposed that EPA use a different test to determine whether multi-use equipment should be considered farm or
construction equipment for purposes of determining the scope of federal preemption. This test would be that federal
preemption applies whenever equipment is used in more than 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
de minimis
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 amounts for farming or construction, and such equipment is necessary to perform farming and construction activities.
PPEMA did not state any criteria to be used in determining such a ``
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
de minimis
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
'' amount or determining what ``necessary'' is. PPEMA supported this proposal with several arguments. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
First, PPEMA argued that a 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
de minimis
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 test follows the plain language of the statute. PPEMA argued that the ``plain language'' of the statute does not include
modifiers such as ``primarily'' or ``predominantly'' and thus does not in any way imply that Congress intended for
EPA to apply a percentage test to determine if equipment was used for farming or construction. PPEMA contended that
Congress intended to preempt state regulation of all nonroad engines used in farm and construction equipment. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Second, PPEMA argued that Congress explicitly limited the scope of preemption by specifying that preemption would
apply to regulation of engines used in farm and construction equipment smaller than 175 horsepower. Thus, according
to PPEMA, there is no need for EPA to clarify the scope of preemption further. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
PPEMA's final argument is that a 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
de minimis
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 test would not unduly expand the scope of federal preemption. Equipment would be preempted only if it were found in
more than 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
de minimis
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 amounts and were necessary to the performance of farm and construction operations.

Primary Use Test
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
EPA has decided to apply the primary use test to determine which multiple-use equipment will be considered farm or
construction equipment and thus preempted from state regulation. As explained in the NPRM, the ``primary use'' test
is the most appropriate method for classifying (as farm or construction, or other) multiple use equipment. Industry
commenters who believe EPA must consider multiple-use equipment to be farm or construction equipment beg the question
of what is farm and construction equipment. Some industry commenters stated that EPA could not use the primary use
test because the language of section 209(e)(1) refers to new engines which are used in construction or farm equipment
or vehicles, not to engines which are ``primarily'' used in construction of farm equipment or vehicles. These comments
miss the point of the primary use test. The test is not used to define ``used in'', but is used to define ``construction
equipment'' and ``farm equipment''. In order to identify an engine used in farm or construction equipment, EPA must
first determine whether a piece of equipment is farm or construction equipment. Equipment used only incidentally
(perhaps 10 percent) in farm or construction applications is not fairly considered to be farm or construction equipment.
A type of equipment such as a pump, for example, is not farm equipment merely because it is used on a handful of farms and
otherwise used exclusively in residential settings. Therefore, the engine used in this type of equipment is not an
engine used in farm or construction equipment and, therefore, regulation of that engine type is not preempted.
