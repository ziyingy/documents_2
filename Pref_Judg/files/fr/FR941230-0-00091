The Pacific Fishery Management Council (Council) prepared, and the Secretary of Commerce approved and implemented,
an amendment (Amendment 6) to the FMP, which established a limited entry program for the Pacific Coast groundfish
fishery off the coasts of Washington, Oregon, and California. Described simply, Amendment 6 and its implementing
regulations base initial issuance of limited entry permits upon: (1) Actual participation in the fishery during
the ``window period'' of July 11, 1984, to August 1, 1988, as evidenced by requisite landings of groundfish; or (2)
other evidence of an intent to participate in the fishery prior to August 1, 1988, followed by actual participation
in the fishery. Owners of vessels that made the requisite groundfish landings during the window period are eligible
to receive an ``A'' endorsement, which entitles the owner to fish with the same vessel, transfer the permit to another
vessel no larger than 5 ft (1.52 m) longer than the qualifying vessel, or sell the permit. ``A'' endorsed permits do
not expire, so long as the owner renews them annually; that is, there is no need to actually use the vessel in the fishery
to maintain eligibility for the program.

Owners of vessels that did not make the requisite groundfish landings during the window period, but can show evidence
that they were preparing to enter the fishery, are eligible to receive a ``provisional A'' endorsement, which allows
them to participate in the fishery for up to a 3-year period. The ``provisional A'' category is intended to cover persons
who, prior to the close of the window period, began to construct a new vessel or convert an old vessel (or contracted
for such construction/conversion), but did not make the requisite landings of groundfish during the window period.
This category requires that the vessel actually participate in the groundfish fishery after its construction or
its conversion is complete. A ``provisional A'' endorsement requires that the owner land a minimum amount of groundfish
during each 365-day period commencing with the first landing of any species of fish subsequent to the vessel having
been constructed or converted. If the requisite 3 years of landings are completed, the owner is eligible to convert
a ``provisional A'' endorsement into an ``A'' endorsement. If the requisite 3 years of landings are not completed,
when scheduled, the ``provisional A'' endorsed permit expires.

The FMP amendment that describes the limited entry program was adopted by the Council in September 1991, and submitted
to the Secretary for approval in 1992. A notice of availability and a proposed rule for Amendment 6 were published for
public comment in the

 on June 10, 1992 (57 FR 24589), and July 22, 1992 (57 FR 32499) respectively. The Secretary approved Amendment 6 on September
4, 1992. Final regulations responding to public comment were published on November 16, 1992 (57 FR 54001).

During the development of Amendment 6, NOAA published two notices in the

 informing the public of the Council's progress in developing the program so that fishing vessel owners could make
business decisions with some idea of what to expect the limited entry program would require, regarding requirements
to qualify for a limited entry permit.

In a ``control date'' notice of August 4, 1988 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(53 FR 29337), the Council announced that only current owners of vessels used to catch fish in the fishery during the
period commencing on July 11, 1984, and ending on August 1, 1988, were likely to be eligible for initial permits under
the forthcoming Amendment 6.

A subsequent notice published August 28, 1990 (55 FR 35163), set forth the Council's intent to impose a September 30,
1990, cutoff date for the completion of newly constructed or converted vessels, and that the Council would attempt
to limit fishing vessel harvesting capacity by endorsing limited entry permits with the ``length overall'' of the
qualifying vessel. This notice also announced that replacement vessels more than 5 ft (1.52 m) greater in overall
length than qualifying vessels that they replaced may be given a permit endorsed for the size of the smaller qualifying
vessel if replacement occurred after September 30, 1990, while replacement vessels in place prior to September 30,
1990, may be given a permit endorsed for the size of the larger replacement vessel. ``In place'' means that a new vessel
had been acquired and the old vessel had been disposed of.
