Ms. Hill, a 22-year-old, is forced to stop work because of illness. When she contacts a Social Security office to inquire
about applying for disability insurance benefits, she is told by an SSA employee that she must have 20 quarters of coverage
out of the last 40 calendar quarters to be insured for disability insurance benefits. The employee fails to consider
the special rules for insured status for persons who become disabled before age 31 and, consequently, tells Ms. Hill
that she is not insured because she only has 16 quarters of coverage. The misinformation causes Ms. Hill not to file
an application for disability insurance benefits. Because of her illness, she is unable to return to work. A year later,
Ms. Hill reads an article that indicates that there are special rules for insured status for young workers who become
disabled. She again contacts a Social Security office to inquire about benefits based on disability and learns that
she was misinformed earlier about her insured status. She files an application for disability insurance benefits,
provides the information required under paragraph (f) of this section to show that an SSA employee provided misinformation,
and requests a deemed filing date based on the misinformation provided to her earlier.
