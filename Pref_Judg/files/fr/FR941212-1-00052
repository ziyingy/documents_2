Providing the public with access to the application content as originally filed will serve the legislative purpose
of more rapid dissemination of the technical content of a patent application. Additional access to papers filed by
an applicant, or issued by the PTO, will not add to the disclosure of the technical content of an application, but would
be useful for (1) determining the metes and bounds of the invention claimed in an application, such that persons could
ascertain their potential liability for infringement should the application issue as a patent, and (2) participating
in the prosecution of the application, e.g., submitting prior art or a protest in the application. Unless the contemplated
electronic data base is in operation when the proposed legislation becomes effective, or contingency arrangements
permitting equivalent access to the application content are developed, any access to a pending application will
require the removal of the application file from the examiner to allow copying of the accessible portions. The degree
of access provided to pending applications may well have an adverse impact on the examination process by increasing
the pendency of applications. Balancing the desires for reasonable access to applications subsequent to publication
with the continued desirability for limiting pendency of applications, the PTO currently contemplates that access
will be limited to the content of the originally filed application papers as amended prior to the 15th month from the
earliest filing date for which a benefit is sought, or, on filing, whichever is later. In other words, publication
of the application at 18 months would entitle any member of the public to purchase a copy of the application (specification,
claims, and drawings) as amended at a point in time prior to publication. Other options regarding access to the application
file after publication include access to the entire content of the application file from filing up to the date of publication,
or continuing access to the application file after publication, including all papers contained in the file wrapper
from filing to grant to the patent. As access is increased, more information about the court of prosecution is available
to the public, but the opportunity for disruption of the examination process, and the opportunity for increased costs
and pendency, also increases. See Question

10. Finally, the PTO also requests comments on whether, subsequent to publication, access should be provided to (1)
the assignment records of an application, or (2) the deposit of biological materials as set forth in 37 CFR 1.802 et
seq. See Questions

12. The PTO currently contemplates that access fees, either for copying the paper application file, or searching
and copying information from an electronic data base, will be required to compensate for the costs of providing these
services.

2. Submission of Amendments

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The current procedures for entering amendments into applications sometimes cause errors in the entry of amendments
into applications and in the printing of applications as patents. To facilitate the accurate entry of amendments
into applications and the printing of applications as patents, as well as the understanding of the applications (specification,
claims, and drawings) by a person seeking access, the PTO is also considering altering the current procedures for
entering amendments into applications. The procedures for entering amendments into an application could take the
form of requiring (a) substitute paragraphs of specification and the complete rewriting of any amended claim, (b)
substitute pages or sheets of specification, drawings or claims, or (c) replacement of the entire application. See

The current protest practice as provided for in 37 CFR 1.291 and M.P.E.P. Section 1901 et seq. requires that the protest
identify the application under protest by application number or serial number and filing date and include a listing
of all patents, publications or other information relied upon, a concise explanation of the relevance of each listed
item, an English translation of non-English language documents and be accompanied by a copy of each document. In addition,
the protest papers must reflect that a copy of the same has been served upon the applicant or upon the applicant's attorney
or agent of record, or be filed with the PTO in duplicate in the event that service is not possible. It is important that
any protest against a pending application specifically identify the application with as much detail as possible.

In 1974, a Trial Voluntary Protest Program (TVPP), which included two trial programs, was undertaken by the PTO. A
total of 6,745 applicants were given the opportunity to participate in the TVPP. In response, 1,970 or 29.2 percent
of the applicants elected to participate. Protests were subsequently filed in 128, or 6.5 percent, of the 1,970 published
applications. Prosecution was re-opened in eighty, or 62.5 percent, of the protested applications. The pendency
of published applications which were not protested was delayed by 6 to 8 months. The pendency of protested applications
was further delayed for varying periods.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
As noted above, 6.5 percent of all of the TVPP applications were protested. If we assume that ten (10) percent of the
published applications are protested this would lead to a dramatic increase of protests. In fact, the ten (10) percent
figure may be on the low side, since the claims in the TVPP applications were in allowable condition. As of the contemplated
cut-off date, many of the applications may not, as yet, have isolated the metes and bounds of allowable subject matter.
