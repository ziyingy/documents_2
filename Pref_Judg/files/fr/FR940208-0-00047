<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Iowa proposes to revise its rules at IAC 27&hyph;40.63(12) by deleting 30 CFR 816.89, dealing with disposal of noncoal
mine wastes, from the State's incorporation by reference of 30 CFR Part 816 and inserting, in lieu thereof, the following:

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->
(a) Noncoal mine wastes including, but not limited to, grease, garbage, abandoned mining machinery, lumber and other
combustible materials generated during mining activities shall be placed and stored in a controlled manner in a landfill
permitted by the Iowa department of natural resources (DNR) pursuant to 561 IAC 101, 102, and 103. Lubricants, paints,
and flammable liquids may not be buried in the State of Iowa but, along with and (sic) other toxic wastes, must be disposed
of in the legally prescribed manner. Iowa law prohibits final disposal of noncoal wastes within the permit area.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Pending final disposal at a permitted DNR facility, noncoal mine waste shall be placed and stored in a controlled manner
in a designated portion of the permit area so as to ensure that leachate and surface runoff do not degrade surface or
ground water, that fires are prevented and that the area remains stable and suitable for reclamation and revegetation
compatible with the natural surroundings.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Noncoal mine waste shall at no time be deposited in a refuse pile or impounding structure.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
No excavation for or storage of noncoal mine waste shall be located within eight feet of any coal outcrop or coal storage
area.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(b) Final disposal of noncoal mine wastes shall be in a designated, State-approved solid waste disposal site permitted
by the Iowa department of natural resources pursuant to 561 IAC 101, 102, and 103.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(c) Notwithstanding any other provision in this chapter, any noncoal mine waste defined as ``hazardous'' under section
3001 of the resource Conservation and Recovery Act (RCRA) (Pub. L. 94&hyph;580 as amendment) and 40 CFR Part 261 shall
be handled in accordance with the requirements of Subtitle C of RCRA and any implementing regulations.

The State proposal differs from the Federal provision at 30 CFR 816.89 in several respects. First, Iowa's proposed
rule makes it clear that, in Iowa, lubricants, paints, and flammable liquids may not be buried and must be disposed
of in the legally prescribed manner. This difference between the State and the Federal provisions does not render
the State program less effective in meeting SMCRA's requirements than the Federal regulation since the Federal provision
at 30 CFR 816.89(b) explicitly provides that operation of a disposal site shall be conducted in accordance with all
local, State, and Federal requirements.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Second, Iowa's proposed rule also makes it clear that there can be no final disposal of noncoal wastes within the permit
area. Instead, final disposal of noncoal mine wastes must be in a landfill permitted by the Iowa Department of Natural
Resources. This provision of the Iowa program is no less effective in meeting SMCRA's requirements than the Federal
counterpart provisions since the Federal provision at 30 CFR 816.89(b) requires that final disposal of noncoal mine
waste shall be in a designated disposal site in the permit area

or

a State-approved solid waste disposal area.
