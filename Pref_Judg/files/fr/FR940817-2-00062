Under section 211(f)(4) of the Act, twenty-three applications for waivers of the section 211(f)(1) prohibitions
have been received. Of these, twenty-two applications have sought a waiver for additives for unleaded gasoline.
One, the most recent, sought a waiver of the section 211(f)(1)(B) prohibitions for an additive to diesel fuel.
<FOOTCITE>13</FOOTCITE>
 Of these twenty-three applications, ten applications have been granted (some with conditions attached), ten have
been denied, and three were withdrawn by the applicant prior to the Agency's decision.

Section 211(f)(4) clearly places upon the waiver applicant the burden of establishing that its fuel will not cause
or contribute to the failure of any vehicle to meet emission standards. Absent a sufficient showing, the Administrator
cannot make the required determination and cannot grant the waiver. If interpreted literally, however, this burden
of proof imposed by the Act would be virtually impossible for an applicant to meet, as it requires the proof of a negative
proposition: that no vehicle will fail to meet emission standards to which it has been certified. Such a literal interpretation
could be construed as requiring the testing of every vehicle. Recognizing that Congress contemplated a workable
waiver provision, EPA has previously indicated that reliable statistical sampling and fleet testing protocols
may be used to demonstrate that a fuel under consideration would not cause or contribute to a significant failure to
meet emission standards by vehicles in the national fleet.

To determine whether a waiver applicant has established that the proposed fuel will not cause or contribute to vehicles
failing emission standards, EPA reviews all the material in the public docket, including the data submitted with
the application and public comments on the application, and analyzes the data to ascertain the fuel's emission effects.
The analysis concentrates on four major areas of concern_exhaust emissions, evaporative emissions, materials'
compatibility, and driveability_and evaluates the data under statistical methods appropriate to the various types
of emission effects. Emission data are analyzed according to the effects that a fuel is predicted to have on emissions
over time. If the fuel is predicted to have only an instantaneous effect on emissions (that is, the emission effects
of the fuel are immediate and remain constant throughout the life of the vehicle when operating on the waiver fuel),
then ``back-to-back'' emissions testing will suffice.

Back-to-back emission testing involves testing a vehicle on a base fuel (i.e., a gasoline which meets specifications
for certification fuel or is representative of a typically available commercial gasoline), then testing that same
vehicle on the fuel for which the waiver is requested. The difference in emission levels is attributed to the waiver
fuel.

Unlike materials traditionally allowed in unleaded gasoline, metallics, such as MMT, produce non-gaseous combustion
products, some of which may be deposited in the parts of the vehicle that come in contact with the combustion products
of the burned fuel. These areas of the vehicle include the combustion chamber, the catalyst, the oxygen sensor, and
all parts of the exhaust system.
<FOOTCITE>16</FOOTCITE>
 Since these materials build up over time,
<FOOTCITE>17</FOOTCITE>
 it has been traditionally accepted that the emissions effects of such additives occur over time as miles are accumulated,
and that the method of deposition suggests that the effects are permanent. If the fuel is predicted to have such a long-term
deteriorative effect, durability testing over the useful life of the vehicle,
<FOOTCITE>18</FOOTCITE>
 in addition to back-to-back testing, is appropriate.

Automakers and catalyst manufacturers point out that, since catalysts are designed with a honeycomb structure in
order to maximize contact between engine combustion gases and catalyst materials, if channels within the honeycomb
become blocked, the catalyst is less able to break down the exhaust gases. Furthermore, although the mechanisms associated
with manganese deposits have not been completely described, catalyst manufacturers suggest that the mere disposition
of manganese (without blockage of channels) would hinder the catalytic activity of the catalyst. Ethyl, however,
believes that the manganese deposition on the catalyst does not hinder its activity.

The ``useful life'' of a 1993 or earlier model year light-duty vehicle (LDV) (i.e., the amount of time or mileage accumulation
through which the LDV must meet the standards to which it has been certified) is 50,000 miles or five years, whichever
occurs first (&sect;202(d)). The 1990 Amendments extended the useful life of LDVs to 100,000 miles or ten years, beginning
with 1994 model year vehicles. The amendments also tightened emissions standards for 40 percent of a vehicle manufacturer's
LDV and light-duty truck (LDT) sales in model year 1994, 80 percent in model year 1995 and for all vehicles after model
year 1995 (&sect;202(g)). The useful life for heavy-duty vehicles and engines is generally 120,000 miles or eleven
years.

Durability testing over the useful life of the vehicle has involved testing two identical sets of vehicles for 50,000
miles (in the case of pre-1994 standards for LDVs), one set using the base fuel and the other using the waiver fuel. Each
vehicle is tested for emissions at 5,000 mile intervals. This is essentially the same testing pattern which has been
required for certification of a new motor vehicle under &sect;206 of the Act. As noted above, under the 1990 Amendments,
the useful life of LDVs has been extended to 100,000 miles beginning with the 1994 model year when more stringent emissions
standards took effect (
