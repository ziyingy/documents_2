(i) The ship units that are loading or unloading within the explosives anchorage are separated properly, taking into
consideration location and the amount of explosives in each ship unit. The ship unit equivalent for an explosives
anchorage is a circle, the radius of which is the distance from the mooring buoy or the ship's anchor to the stern of the
ship or of the ammunition lighters alongside when riding to the full scope of the chain. To maintain proper separation
distance between loading or unloading ship units in the explosives anchorage, the ships shall moor or anchor so that
at no time will they have a separation distance less than 11W

(ii) The ships being loaded or unloaded at one area are separated properly from the loaded ships in another area and
whether the loaded ships within the loaded ship area are separated properly from each other. If the latter conditions
do not apply, the quantity for entering the table shall be the total quantity rather than the unit quantity.

Siting criteria and application of Q/D separation requirements_(1) Scuttling site.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 (i) A properly located scuttling site shall be provided, if practicable, for positioning a ship for its flooding or
sinking in the event a vessel catches fire and shall be moved to avert damage to other ships or piers. It shall have sufficient
sea room and depth of water to permit the sinking of the largest vessel that may be handled at the installation so that
the holds will be flooded completely at low water.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(ii) Since an explosion may occur while the vessel is being moved, the location of the scuttling site shall provide
the best available protection to other ships, piers, and shore installations.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(iii) The location of the scuttling site will depend on the greatest net quantity of mass-detonating explosives that
may be in a single ship at any one time. The Q/D tables to be used will depend on the particular types of targets.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(2) Explosives anchorage. The location of an explosives anchorage shall be separated not only from the main ship channel
or from normally traversed routes of ships entering or leaving the harbor by column 8, Appendix A to this subpart distances
but also by turning circles and stopping distances of the ships. Assuming that the diameter of the turning circle of
a ship is 1,000 yards, an explosives anchorage shall be located so that a ship in the channel with a jammed rudder will
clear an anchored explosives-laden ship. From the turning circle standpoint, the separation distances shall be
not less than 3,000 feet.

Separation of ships at explosives anchorages.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 (A) When explosives anchorages are used for loading and unloading ships, as well as for fully loaded vessels anchored
at their berths, ships that are being loaded or unloaded shall be separated from fully loaded ships.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(B) When the explosives anchorage is used only for loading and unloading ships, to prevent mass detonation, ships
in the explosives anchorage shall be separated by at least 11W
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=1 -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(3) Separation distances of ship units in tandem at the sam pier. (i) Since the second ship would be in an area of heavy
fragment density from the exploding ship, it could be set afire and later caused to mass-detonate. A direct hit by a
steel fragment on ammunition alongside the ship or in an open hold could also cause a mass detonation. The separation
distances based on blast damage alone accordingly are not enough to take care of such fragment hazards. Berthing of
the two ships in tandem will help to decrease the fragment hazard to the explosives cargo of the second ship because
of the additional protection afforded by the bow or stern.

 distances and are being loaded through all hatches, the spotting of cars and the loading of hatches in both ships should
be planned so as to put the greatest possible distance between open hatches of both ships, and between the trucks and
freight cars serving the two ships. When possible, the loading of the ships should be staggered.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(4) Separation of explosives ships from other ships. Explosives ships being loaded or unloaded shall be separated
from nonexplosives-carrying ships and from loaded explosives ships that are not underway by 40W

distances. As PES, ship or barge units shall be separated from explosives operating facilities by Column 5, Appendix
