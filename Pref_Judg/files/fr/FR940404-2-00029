Federal, state, and local resource agencies, licensees and developers, Indian tribes, other interested groups,
and the general public are invited to forward to the Commission any information that they believe will assist the Commission
Staff in conducting an accurate and thorough analysis of the site-specific and cumulative environmental effects
of the proposed licensing activities on the Wisconsin River. The types of information sought include: 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
&bull;Information, quantified data, or professional opinion that may contribute to defining the geographical
and temporal scope of the analysis and identifying significant environmental issues. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
&bull;Identification of and information from any other environmental assessment, environmental impact statement,
or similar document or study (previous, on-going, or planned) relevant to the proposed licensing activities in the
Wisconsin River Basin. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
&bull;Existing information and any data that would aid in describing the past and present actions and effects of the
projects and other developmental activities on the physical/chemical, biological, and socioeconomic environments.
For example, fish stocking/management histories, historic water quality data and the reasons for improvement or
degradation of the quality, any wetland habitat losses or proposals to develop land and water resources within the
basin. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
&bull;Identification of any federal, state, or local resource plans and future project proposals that encompass
the Wisconsin River Basin with information on when they'll be implemented, if known. For example, proposals to construct
or operate water treatment facilities, recreation areas, water diversions, or implement fishery management programs.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
&bull;Documentation that would support a conclusion that the actions or a project(s) does or does not contribute
to cumulative adverse or beneficial effects on resources and therefore should be excluded from further study or excluded
from further consideration of cumulative effects within the Wisconsin River Basin. Documentation should include,
but is not limited to: how the projects interact with other projects within the river basin and other developmental
activities; results from studies; resource management policies; and reports from federal, state, and local agencies.
