III. Program Description.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
MARFIN is a competitive Federal grant program that promotes and endorses programs that seek to optimize economic
and social benefits from marine fishery resources through cooperative efforts that involve the best research and
management talents to accomplish priority activities. Preference is given to selecting and funding applications
for project grants that provide an opportunity for cooperative NMFS/applicant efforts and for multiple cooperating
applicants/NMFS efforts with up to 3-year time horizons. Projects funded under MARFIN are focused into cooperative
efforts that provide clear answers for fishery needs covered by the NMFS Strategic Plan, available from the Southeast
Regional Office (see 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=2 -->
ADDRESSES
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
), particularly those goals relating to rebuilding overfished marine fisheries, maintaining currently productive
fisheries, and integrating conservation of protected species and fisheries management.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Applications from multiple cooperating applicants that address conservation and management needs over a wide range
of a fishery or fishery organism are encouraged. Emphasis will be placed upon funding projects that have the greatest
probability of recovering, maintaining, improving, or developing fisheries; improving the understanding of factors
affecting recruitment success; and/or generating increased values and recreational opportunities from fisheries.
Projects will be evaluated as to the likelihood of achieving these benefits through both short-term and long-term
research efforts, with consideration of the magnitude of the eventual economic or social benefits that may be realized.
Short-term projects that may yield more immediate benefits, and projects yielding longer-term benefits will receive
equal consideration.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 -->
IV. Funding Availability.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
This solicitation announces that funding of approximately $1.25 million may be available in FY 1995 pending Congressional
appropriation. MARFIN financial assistance started in FY 1986, and for FY 1986 through FY 1994, awards totaled about
$15.5 million for financial assistance to conduct research for fishery resources in the Gulf of Mexico and off the
South Atlantic states of North Carolina, South Carolina, Georgia and Florida. There is no guarantee that sufficient
funds will be available to make awards for all approved projects.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Project proposals accepted for funding for a project period over 1 year that include multiple project components
or severable tasks to be funded each budget period will not compete for funding in subsequent budget periods within
the approved project period. However, funding for subsequent project components is contingent upon the availability
of funds from Congress and satisfactory performance, and will be at the sole discretion of the agency. Publication
of this notice does not obligate NMFS to award any specific cooperative agreement or to obligate all or any parts of
the available funds.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 -->
V. Matching Requirements.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Applications must reflect the total budget necessary to accomplish the project, including contributions and/or
donations. Cost-sharing is not required for the MARFIN program. However, cost-sharing is encouraged, and in case
of a tie in considering proposals for funding, cost-sharing may affect the final decision. The appropriateness of
all cost-sharing will be determined on the basis of guidance provided in applicable Federal cost principles. If an
applicant chooses to cost-share, and if that application is selected for funding, the applicant will be bound by the
percentage of the cost share reflected in the cooperative agreement award.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The non-Federal share may include funds received from private sources or from state or local governments, or the value
of in-kind contributions by the applicant or third parties. Federal funds may not be used to meet the non-Federal share
of matching funds, except as provided by Federal statute. In-kind contributions may be in the form of, but are not limited
to, personal services rendered in carrying out functions related to the project, and use of real or personal property
owned by others (for which consideration is not required) in carrying out the projects.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The total cost of a project begins on the effective date of a cooperative agreement between the applicant and the NOAA
Grants Officer and ends on the date specified in the award. Accordingly, time expended and costs incurred in either
the development of a project or the financial assistance application, or in any subsequent discussions or negotiations
prior to the award, are neither reimbursable nor recognizable as part of the recipient's cost share.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 -->
VI. Type of Funding Instrument.

The areas of special emphasis are listed below, but proposals in other areas will be considered on a funds-available
basis.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In addition to referencing specific area(s) of special interest as listed below, proposals should state whether
the research will apply to the Gulf of Mexico only, the South Atlantic only, or to both areas. Successful applicants
may be required to collect and manage data in accordance with standardized procedures and formats approved by NMFS,
and to participate with NMFS in specific cooperative activities that will be determined by consultations between
NMFS and successful applicants before project grants are awarded. Recipients of financial assistance for projects
with multiple project periods must include funding in their applications for travel expenses for the principal investigator
to participate in one annual project review and evaluation meeting in St. Petersburg, FL. All recipients of financial
assistance under this program shall include funding in their applications for the principal investigator to participate
in an annual MARFIN Conference at the completion of the project.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Research needs identified in fishery management plans (FMPs) and amendments prepared by the Gulf and South Atlantic
Fishery Management Councils (Councils) and the Gulf and Atlantic States Marine Fisheries Commissions (Commissions)
are included. For availability of these documents, contact the NMFS Southeast Regional Office (see 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=2 -->
ADDRESSES
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
). Areas of special emphasis for FY 1995 include:
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
1. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Shrimp Trawler Bycatch
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Studies are needed to contribute to the regional shrimp trawler bycatch program being conducted by NMFS in cooperation
with state fishery management agencies, commercial and recreational fishing organizations and interests, environmental
organizations, universities, Councils, and Commissions. Specific guidance and research requirements are contained
in the Regional Bycatch Plan prepared through the Gulf and South Atlantic Fisheries Development Foundation. In particular,
the studies should address:
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
a. Data collection and analyses to expand and update current bycatch estimates temporally and spatially from offshore,
nearshore, and inshore waters, emphasizing areas of greatest shrimping impact. Sampling effort should include
estimates of numbers, weight, and age structure of the associated bycatch complex.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
b. Assessments of the status and condition of fish stocks significantly impacted by shrimp trawler bycatch, with
emphasis given to overfished species under the jurisdiction of the Councils.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
c. Identification, development, and evaluation of gear, non- gear and tactical fishing options to reduce bycatch.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
d. Improved methods for communicating with and improving technology and information transfer to the shrimp industry.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
e. Social and economic impacts of management options to reduce shrimp fishery bycatch. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
a. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Longline Fisheries, Including Bycatch
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
A number of pelagic longline fisheries exist in the Gulf and South Atlantic, targeting highly migratory species such
as tunas, some sharks, and swordfish. These fisheries have evolved rapidly over the last decade, with increases in
fishing effort and changes in fishing gear and tactics. These changes need to be characterized and their effects quantified.
High priority areas include:
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(1) Characterization of specific longline fisheries, including targeted species, stock identification, catch-per-unit-effort
of bycatch, and biological parameters (e.g., sex ratios and reproductive state) by gear type, area and season.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(2) Evaluation of vessel log data for monitoring the fisheries.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(3) Development and evaluation of gear and fishing tactics to minimize bycatch of undersized and unwanted species,
including sea turtles and marine mammals.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(4) Assessment of the impact of longline bycatch on related fisheries, including biological, social, and economic
factors and effects. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(5) Dependence of vessels and persons engaged in pelagic longlining on other fisheries. Particular emphasis should
be placed on the extent to which the capital and/or labor engages in other fisheries at particular times of the year
and reasons for this switching behavior.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
b. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Sharks
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
A Secretarial FMP for sharks has been developed that identifies a number of research needs, including:
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(1) Characterization of the commercial and recreational fisheries from historical and current databases. Emphasis
should be on species composition, bycatch, stock identification, size, sex ratios and catch-per-unit-effort by
season, area, and gear type.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(2) Collection and analysis of basic biological data on movements, habitats, growth rates, mortality rates, age
structure and reproduction parameters. These data are of particular importance for blacktip and sandbar sharks.
Information on the relationship of sandbar sharks to water depth and determination of the southern boundary of its
range are specifically needed.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(3) Determination of baseline cost and returns for commercial fisheries that land sharks, and estimation of demand
curves for shark products and recreational shark fisheries. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(4) Development of species profiles and stock assessments for sharks taken in significant quantities by commercial
and recreational fishers, and as bycatch in other fisheries. Assessments can be species-specific or for species
groups, following those identified in the Atlantic Sharks FMP.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(5) Identification of coastal sharks, using laboratory methodologies.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(6) Development of a more precise and accurate estimate of the recreational shark fishery. Proposals in this area
must demonstrate a knowledge of the Marine Recreational Fishery Statistical Survey (MRFSS), and should indicate
a willingness to participate directly in the MRFSS through add-on surveys or enhancement of current surveys.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(7) Development of fishery-independent abundance indices.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
3. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Reef Fish
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
A number of species within the reef fish complex are showing signs of being overfished, either by directed efforts
or as bycatch in other fisheries. The ecology of reef fish makes them vulnerable to overfishing because they tend to
concentrate over specific types of habitats with patchy distribution. This behavior pattern can make traditional
fishery statistics misleading. Priority research areas include:
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
a. Collection of basic biological data for species in commercially and recreationally important fisheries.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(1) Age and growth of reef fish.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(a) Description of age and growth patterns (especially red snapper, gray triggerfish and red porgy in the Gulf of Mexico
and greater amberjack in the Gulf and South Atlantic).
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(b) Development of annual age-length keys for vermilion snapper in the northern Gulf and west coast central Florida,
and for red grouper in the Gulf, along with new growth models for red grouper that include possible density-dependent
effects, as well as environmental effects.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(2) Reproduction studies of reef fish.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(a) Maturity schedules and fecundity of commercially and recreationally important reef fish (especially gray triggerfish
and red porgy in the Gulf of Mexico).
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(b) Detailed histological studies of red snapper to characterize the actual reproductive contribution of females,
by age.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(c) Identification and characterization of spawning aggregations by species, areas, and seasons. Information
is especially needed on changes in sex ratios for gag grouper caused by fishing on spawning aggregations.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(d) Reproductive studies covering extensive geographic distributions along the southeastern U.S. coast (North
Carolina through the Florida Keys). Samples should be obtained from recreational (private and headboats) and commercial
vessels.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(e) Reproductive biology of gag, red grouper and other grouper species. Of particular importance are evaluation
of sperm limitation, determination of the proximal causes of sex change (whether behavioral or developmental),
determination of the annual periodicity of sex-change induction and age-specific spawning frequency, and other
research identified in the recommendations of the workshop on grouper reproduction held in Panama City, FL, in November
1993.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(3) Recruitment of reef fish.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(a) Source of recruitment in Gulf of Mexico and South Atlantic waters (especially amberjack and vermilion snapper),
and possible Caribbean source for Florida Keys snapper and grouper.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(b) Annual estimation of the absolute or relative recruitment of juvenile gag to the seagrass beds off the west coast
of Florida and to similar estuarine nursery habitats along the South Atlantic Bight; development of an index of juvenile
gag recruitment for the South Atlantic based on historical databases and/or field studies.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(c) Evaluation of the contribution of live-bottom habitat to reef fish recruitment 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(4) Stock structure of reef fish.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(a) Movement and migration patterns of commercially and recreationally valuable reef fish species (especially
gag and greater amberjack in the South Atlantic).
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(b) Techniques to allow field separation of lesser amberjack, almaco jack, and banded rudderfish from greater amberjack
to facilitate accurate reporting of catch.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(c) Stock structure of gag and wreckfish in the South Atlantic, and greater amberjack in the Gulf and South Atlantic.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(d) Use of parasitological surveys in species such as wreckfish and white grunt to determine stock structure.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
b. Behavioral studies of reef fish.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(1) Description of the behavior of age&hyph;0 and age&hyph;1 red snapper.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(2) Effects of fishing on reproductive behavior, in formation of aggregations and disruption of existing aggregations.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
c. Population assessment of reef fish.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(1) Effect of reproductive mode and sex change (protogynous hermaphroditism) on population size and characteristics,
with reference to sizes of fish exploited in the fisheries and the significance to proper management.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(2) Design of sampling routines to provide a production-style aging program representative of the reef fish fishery.
Effective dock-side sampling programs, especially for groupers, are needed over a wide geographic range to collect
information on reproductive state, size, age, and sex. These research needs are discussed in the report of the workshop
on grouper reproduction held in Panama City, FL, in November 1993.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(3) Source and quantification of natural and human-induced mortalities. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(4) Determination of the habitat and limiting factors for important reef fish resources (such as snappers in the Gulf
of Mexico). Information is also needed on the importance of human-created and natural channels for controlling stock
sizes and growth rates of snappers and groupers.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(5) Description of habitat and fish populations in the deep reef community and the prey distributions supporting
the community.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(6) Evaluation of the effect of misidentifying gag as black grouper on landing statistics and stock assessments.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(8) Assessment of tag performance on reef fish species, mainly snappers and groupers. Characteristics examined
should include shedding rate, effects on growth and survival, and effects of these characteristics on estimations
of vital population parameters.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(9) Stock assessments to establish the status of major recreational and commercial species. Innovative methods
are needed for stock assessments of aggregate species, including the effect of fishing on genetic structure and the
incorporation of sex change for protogynous hermaphrodites into stock assessment models.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(10) Fishery-independent assessments of spawning aggregations of gag, scamp, yellowedge and other groupers, using
hydroacoustic and underwater video technology.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
d. Management of reef fish.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(1) Research in direct support of management, including catch-and-release mortalities by gear and depth, the value
of limiting longlines to specific water depths (e.g., outside the 50&hyph;fathom (91.4&hyph;m) curve), and modifications
(gear, techniques) to minimize bycatch.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(2) Evaluation of the use of reef fish marine reserves as an alternative or supplement to current fishery management
measures and practices, especially in the South Atlantic. Of particular interest is Oculina Banks off the Atlantic
Coast of Florida.

and how these characteristics change in response to management measures.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(4) Characterization and quantification of the biological, economic, and social impacts of the longline fishery
for reef fish along the west coast of Florida. This should include the following:
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(a) Catch-per-unit-effort of target and bycatch species, and biological parameters (e.g., size, sex, and reproductive
state) by gear type, area, and season.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

Coastal Herrings
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Preliminary studies indicate that substantial stocks of coastal herrings occur in the Gulf and South Atlantic. Most
of the available data are generated from fishery-independent surveys conducted by NMFS and state fishery management
agencies. Because of the size of these stocks, their importance as prey, and in some instances as predator species,
their potential for development as commercial and recreational fisheries must be understood. General research
needs include:
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
a. Collection, collation, and analysis of available fishery-independent and fishery-dependent data from state
and Federal surveys, with emphasis on species and size composition, seasonal distribution patterns, biomass, bycatch,
and environmental relationships. Emphasis should be given to species such as Spanish sardine that are important
as prey to gamefish.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
b. Description and quantification of predator-prey relationships between coastal herring species and carnivores
such as mackerels, tunas, swordfish, billfish, sharks, bluefish, and others in high demand by commercial and recreational
fisheries.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
c. Design of innovative economic and social management approaches for the purse seine menhaden fishery, including,
but not limited to, limited entry.

Coastal Migratory Pelagic Fisheries
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The commercial and recreational demand for migratory coastal pelagics has led to overfishing for certain species,
including king and Spanish mackerel. Additionally, some are transboundary with Mexico and other countries and ultimately
will demand international management attention. Current high priorities include:
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
a. Recruitment indices for king and Spanish mackerel, cobia, dolphin, and bluefish, primarily from fishery-independent
data sources.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
b. Assessment and management models for coastal pelagic resources that are dominated by single year classes, such
as Spanish mackerel, dolphin, and bluefish.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
c. Fishery-independent methods of assessing stock abundance of king and Spanish mackerel. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
d. Improved catch statistics for all species in Mexican waters, with special emphasis on king mackerel; needed especially
is length-frequency, life history and genetic information.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
e. Information on populations of coastal pelagics overwintering off North Carolina, South Carolina, and Georgia,
especially population size, age and movement patterns.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
f. Basic biostatistical information on cobia and dolphin to develop age-length keys and maturation schedules for
stock assessments.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
g. Impact of bag limits on total catch and landings of king and Spanish mackerel.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
h. Demand and supply functions for recreational and commercial fisheries for king mackerel in the South Atlantic
and Gulf of Mexico. Emphasis should be on changes in marginal values of producer and consumer surpluses, since the
studies would be used in allocation frameworks where total values are not necessarily required.

Groundfish and Estuarine Fishes
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Substantial stocks of groundfish and estuarine species occur in the Gulf and South Atlantic. Most of the database
for assessments comes from studies conducted by NMFS and state fishery management agencies. Because of the historic
and current size of these fish stocks, their importance as predator and prey species, and their current or potential
use as commercial and recreational fisheries, more information on their biology and conservation is needed. General
research needs are:
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
a. Red drum.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(1) Effects of sportfishing on red drum populations in the Gulf of Mexico and South Atlantic. A specific need in the
South Atlantic is increased sampling of nighttime fishing for red drum on the Outer Banks of North Carolina.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(2) Size and age-structure of the offshore adult red drum stock in the Gulf of Mexico.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(3) Immigration and escapement of red drum from state waters into the Exclusive Economic Zone in the Gulf of Mexico
and the South Atlantic.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(4) Life history parameters and stock structure for the Gulf of Mexico and the South Atlantic. Research should include
migratory patterns, long-term changes in abundance, growth rates and age structure, and comparisons of the inshore
and offshore components of recreational and/or commercial fisheries. Specific research needs for Atlantic red
drum are fecundity estimates, as a function of length and weight, and improved coastwide coverage for age-length
keys.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(5) Catch-and-release mortality rates from inshore and nearshore waters, and fishing mortality rates in state territorial
waters of the Gulf of Mexico.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
b. Life history and stock structure for weakfish, menhaden, spot and croaker in the Gulf of Mexico and the South Atlantic.
Research should include migratory patterns, long-term changes in abundance, growth rates and age structure, and
comparisons of the inshore and offshore components of recreational and/or commercial fisheries.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
c. Improved catch and effort statistics from recreational and commercial fisheries, including size and age structure
of the catch, to develop production models.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
d. Quantification and qualification of the bycatch in finfish trawl fisheries, such as the flounder and fly-net fisheries
in the South Atlantic.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The conservation of endangered and threatened sea turtles in the Southeast Region continues to be a high priority.
Specific needs include:
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
a. Distribution, abundance and size composition of sea turtles in inshore waters, especially where these turtles
may be affected by inshore fisheries.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
b. Turtle excluder device (TED) modifications or designs to exclude adult leatherback sea turtles. The area of special
concern is off South Carolina, Georgia, and Florida.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
c. TED designs and modifications for use in small inshore shrimp trawls. Especially needed is research on shrimp retention
and on the effectiveness of TEDs operating in areas with debris. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

General
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
There are many areas of research that need to be addressed for improved understanding and management of fishery resources.
These include methods for data collection, management, analysis, and for better conservation. Examples of high
priority research needs include:
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
a. Design and critical analysis of a data collection system that may involve permits, logbooks, trip interviews,
dealer reporting or other innovative methods. The system design should be applicable across the entire range of species
that may be pursued throughout the Gulf and South Atlantic, and should address economic, biological and social data
needs.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
b. Assessment of the changes in recreational and commercial values that have resulted from past management practices
for red drum, shrimp, mackerels and reef fish.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
c. Development of improved methods and procedures for technology transfer, and education of constituency groups
on fishery management and conservation programs. Of special importance are programs concerned with controlled
access and introduction of conservation gear.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
d. Compilation of baseline socio-demographic data for describing the social and cultural framework of managed fisheries.
B. Priority in program emphasis will be placed upon funding projects that have the greatest probability of recovering,
maintaining, improving, or developing fisheries; improving the understanding of factors affecting recruitment
success; and generating increased values and recreational opportunities from fisheries. Projects will be evaluated
as to the likelihood of achieving these benefits through short- and long-term research efforts, with consideration
given to the magnitude of the eventual economic benefits that may be realized.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 -->
XIV. Selection Procedures.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
All applications will be ranked by a NMFS scientific panel into two groups: (a) Recommended, and (b) Not Recommended.
Proposals ranked as Not Recommended will not be given further consideration for selection and funding. All rankings
will be presented to a panel of non-NOAA fishery experts, who will individually consider the significance of the problem
addressed in each project proposal, the technical evaluation, and need for funding. These panel members will provide
individual recommendations to NMFS on each proposal classified as Recommended or Not Recommended.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The non-NOAA panel members' individual comments, recommendations and evaluations, and recommendations of the
NMFS scientific panel and NMFS Southeast Program Officer will be considered by the Director, Southeast Region, NMFS
(Regional Director). The Regional Director, in consultation with the NOAA Assistant Administrator for Fisheries,
will: (a) Determine which projects do not substantially duplicate other projects that are currently funded by NOAA
or are approved for funding by other Federal offices, and recommend the projects to be funded. The exact amount of funds
awarded, the final scope of activities, the project duration, and specific NMFS cooperative involvement with the
activities of each project will be determined in pre-award negotiations between the applicant, the NOAA Grants Office,
and the NMFS Program Staff. Projects must not be initiated by recipients until a signed award is received from the NOAA
Grants Office. For project periods of more than 1 year, funds for subsequent budget periods may be provided if initial
project tasks are satisfactorily completed and after NMFS has received MARFIN funds for subsequent periods.
