Including 1994 model year engines in the emissions trading and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
banking program and raises an issue whether engines manufactured in 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
model year 1994 prior to the promulgation of this rule may be 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
included in the program. A similar situation was confronted in the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
original banking and trading rule. There, EPA allowed banking for 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the full 1990 model year, even though the rule was promulgated on 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
July 26, 1990.

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 55 FR 30584, 30587. In that case, EPA placed 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
certain restrictions on the inclusion of 1990 model year engines, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
to ensure credits were only given for significant reductions below 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the 1990 standards. This was to ensure that ``windfall'' credits 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
from exceeding the arguably ``lax'' pre-1991 standards would not be 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
used in the transition to the more stringent 1991 standards. As a 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
result, if no restrictions on trading and banking were imposed, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
then the engines that had always exceeded the 1990 standards would 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
for the first time be able to use the extra reductions as 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
``windfall'' credits to offset engines that did not yet meet the new 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
and more stringent 1991 standards.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
EPA does not believe such restrictions are necessary in this 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
case. Since 1991, engines using other fuels, such as methanol, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
have been able to generate credits to offset higher emitting 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
engines. EPA believes that gaseous-fueled engines should have an 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
equal opportunity to use such credits as gasoline-, diesel-, and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
methanol-fueled engines, now that emissions standards and test 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
procedures are in place in time for the 1994 model year. As EPA 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
explained in the response to comments in the trading and banking 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
final rule, CNG engines were not included at that time due to the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
absence of standards, test procedures, and certification protocols. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
See id
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 at 30609. Now that these rules are in place, there is no 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
longer any reason to disadvantage CNG engines vis a vis other 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
fuels. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In addition, EPA does not believe that the credits 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
manufacturers might obtain from gaseous-fueled engines are 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
``windfall,'' since they arguably would not have manufactured such 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
engines in model year 1994 but for EPA's actions to provide an 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
incentive to do so. Rather, EPA believes manufacturers had an 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
incentive to manufacture gaseous-fueled engines based on EPA 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
actions prior to this final rule. EPA proposed these standards in 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
November 1992, and began developing these standards substantially 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
before that. EPA believes this overall incentive further supports 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
allowing manufacturers to include all 1994 model year engines in 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the trading and banking program. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The aftermarket conversion certification procedures contained 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
in today's rule are available to converters as a way of obtaining 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
an exemption from the tampering prohibition. Since this procedure 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
creates an exemption and is optional it will be available upon 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
publication in the 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 -->
Federal Register
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
. EPA's current policy toward 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
conversions will continue to apply to aftermarket conversions which 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
have not received an exemption under this new program.

The Administrative Procedure Act requires 30 days notice 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
before a rule may become effective, except under certain 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
circumstances such as when the rule recognizes an exemption or when 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the Agency can demonstrate good cause for immediate effect. The 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Agency believes it has good cause for this rule to take immediate 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
effect in the case of the new vehicle standards since compliance 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
with the new vehicle standards is optional until well after the 30 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
day period. In the case of aftermarket conversions, because this 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
rule creates an exemption from the tampering prohibition under 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
section 203 of the Act it does not require 30 days notice, and this 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
exemption will be available upon publication in the

B. New Vehicle Standards 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The new gaseous-fueled vehicle and engine emission standards 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
contained in today's notice are effective with the 1997 model year. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Optional compliance prior to the 1997 model year is available to 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
manufacturers who wish to include their vehicles and engines in 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
emissions averaging, trading and banking programs, as well as the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
CAFE program in the case of natural gas-fueled vehicles. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In general, the Agency seeks to control vehicles operated on 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
alternative fuels so that their emissions are no greater than their 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
petroleum-fueled counterparts. Thus, the exhaust emission 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
standards for gaseous-fueled vehicles are numerically equivalent to 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
those which apply to other, currently regulated vehicles and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
engines. The only significant departure from this approach is in 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the area of hydrocarbon (HC) standards for natural gas fueled 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
vehicles and engines. Prior to the 1994 model year, regulated 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
vehicles (
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
i.e.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
, gasoline, petroleum diesel and methanol) are only 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
required to meet total hydrocarbon (THC) standards. However, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
beginning with the 1994 model year, currently regulated light-duty 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
vehicles and light-duty trucks will also be required to meet 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
separate nonmethane hydrocarbon (NMHC) standards as part of the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Tier 1 requirements of the Clean Air Act.
<FOOTCITE>4</FOOTCITE>
 For natural gas-fueled 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
light-duty vehicles and light-duty trucks only the NMHC standards 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
will apply. In the case of natural gas-fueled heavy-duty engines, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
NMHC standards which provide the same degree of NMHC control as the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
current THC standards provide for petroleum-fueled vehicles will 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
apply. In the case of LPG vehicles and engines, the HC standards 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
are the same as those for currently regulated vehicles. A summary 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
of today's gaseous-fueled vehicle emission standards is contained 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
in Tables 1 through 4.

The Agency uses the phrase ``Tier 1'' to denote the 1994 and later model year standards in part because they are nearly
identical to the Tier 1 standards prescribed by section 202(g) of the Clean Air Act for petroleum-fueled vehicles
(56 FR 25724, June 5, 1991). Use of this phrase is not meant to suggest that gaseous-fueled vehicles are subject to the
section 202(g) Tier 1 standards.
