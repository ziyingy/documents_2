3. An entirely new technology added to a project. The Delta Costs in this category would be all of the costs for the new
technology to be incorporated into the project. Examples would be the installation of a system for heating a bridge
deck or the installation of a cathodic protection system for a bridge structure. In general, Delta Costs will not include
those costs associated with the normal construction of the project that are not a direct part of the new technology.
Examples of features that normally would not be included in Delta Costs include: restriping surfaces after overlays,
redecking in conjunction with the installation of a bridge deck heating system, improvement of subsurface and/or
roadside drainage systems in conjunction with a pavement overlay project, and traffic control during construction
(unless it is unique to the installation or changed in character and cost by the installation, in which cases the increased
costs specifically attributable to the portions of the project would be included in the Delta Costs). 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Costs for data collection, data analysis, and information dissemination are eligible for 100 percent ART funding
on approved T&amp;E projects. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In those instances where the technology used on an approved T&amp;E project fails and the State is required to repair
the roadway to restore it to full standards, a pro rata share of the repair or replacement costs can be eligible for Federal-aid
funds for that system where the installation took place. Such repair of the roadway will not be considered maintenance.

Evaluation Plans 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
When an evaluation plan that includes the construction of a full scale field T&amp;E project has been developed by
HITEC, it will be submitted to the FHWA for review and proposed ART Program funding. The following sections shall be
included in the evaluation plan for the proposed T&amp;E project. This information does not have to be submitted with
the application to HITEC, but will be developed as a part of the HITEC evaluation process.

Project Plan 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The specific purpose and objectives of the T&amp;E project must be delineated, followed by a description of: 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
1. The components of the technology to be evaluated, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
2. The proposed installations, and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
3. Planned observations, including qualitative and quantitative requirements for the term of the project. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
A time/phase chart or time line for the complete project must be included. If the T&amp;E project is to be a part of a larger
construction project, the entire construction project must be described in general detail, and the new technology
described in specific detail within the project.

Data Collection 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The design of each data collection element must be based on the principles of scientific inquiry and structured so
that both the internal and external validity of the data are fully addressed and the results can be applied to other
situations. A detailed plan for the collection of data must accompany the proposal for the project. The plan must,
as a minimum, include: 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
1. The type of data to be collected and the reasons for collecting it, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
2. Criteria and procedures for locating and placing the new technology and for selecting data collection locations,

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
3. Instrumentation to be used for each set of data to be obtained, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
4. Timing of the data collection (e.g., calendar time, clock time, environmental conditions if limiting, and the
interval between readings), 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
5. Procedures for collecting the data, and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
6. Frequency and quantity of data to be obtained during the testing period. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Data collection will be directed toward the determination of functional performance and life cycle costs and, where
applicable, will include: 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
1. Design, construction, maintenance, and operations criteria and cost data, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
2. Relevant environmental and operational characteristics and data at the test site, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
3. Interim maintenance and repair history, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
4. Assessment of safety in both construction or installation and in operations, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
5. Measures of the impact on traffic operations, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
6. Measures of the impact on contiguous property and occupants, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
7. Performance data (e.g., visibility, reflectivity, riding quality, deflection, skid resistance, traffic capacity,
and flow characteristics), and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
8. Other data as needed to fully meet the project objectives.

Cost and Budget 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Detailed information on the estimated total costs and annual costs of the proposed project must be presented, with
a breakdown of capital costs for equipment, instruments, and special materials; payroll costs for labor for installation
and operation of the new technology; payroll costs, travel, and other expenses for observations, data collection,
and analysis; costs for information storage and data retrieval; and costs for publication and distribution of reports
and other proposed technology transfer activities. The proposed source, amount, and allocation of funds for the
non-Federal portion of the costs must be described in the cost and budget data section of the proposal. Up to 80 percent
of the costs of construction for the T&amp;E project may be provided by Federal funds; however, the level of cost-sharing
offered by the proposing agency will be a factor considered in the selection of the projects to be funded under the ART
Program.

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
An annual progress report will be required of each public agency for each T&amp;E project for which the testing, data
collection, and evaluation is underway. In order to meet Congressional deadlines, the report must be received by
the FHWA no later than September 30 each year. The report should include: 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
1. A brief description of the plan for the T&amp;E project, including a description of the technology being evaluated,
