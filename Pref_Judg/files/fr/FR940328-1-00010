I subsequently learned that very often coal companies knowingly submit permit applications which fail to identify
all of the surface owners of record. Usually, this is done because the company does not have all of the surface owners'
permission to mine, although they are negotiating with them and expect, or merely hope, that they will get such permission
later. However, they wish to get the permit as quickly as possible without the cost and delay associated with incremental
permit applications as they may obtain permission or agreements from various surface owners to the company's proposed
surface mining. Furthermore, the more surface owners identified in the application, the more post-mining documents
they must prepare and submit to the State upon completion of mining. Since the States require neither documentation
of the ownership of the surface of property proposed for surface mining, nor verify the information provided by coal
companies in the permit application review process, the coal companies have little incentive to accurately identify
the surface owners of the property. The biggest danger here, of course, is that some surface owners may find their property
being strip mined, notwithstanding that they never granted permission to mine to the mining permittee. Further,
the permittee could be expected to defend itself by highlighting the fact that the State had given a permit to mine the
property.

This major loophole in the law should be closed. I propose a new regulation be issued by the Office of Surface Mining
or the Department of the Interior, as appropriate, which would require all permit applications for surface mining
include documentation with public records identifying the surface owners of the property they propose to mine as
well as the property contiguous to the proposed mining property.

Please consider this much needed corrective regulation. The rights of citizens such as America Caudill will continue
to be overlooked despite the protective provisions in SMCRA unless coal companies are required to document the information
they provide in their surface mining permit applications. Please advise me whether your Department may pursue this
matter. Also, please call or write to me if you desire any further information or if there is anything further that I
can do to assist you and your Department in its consideration of my request.
