SUMMARY:
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
 EPA is issuing this interim final rule to revise its asbestos Model Accreditation Plan (MAP) to clarify the types of
persons who must be accredited to work with asbestos in schools and public and commercial buildings; to increase the
minimum number of hours of training, including additional hours of hands-on health and safety training, for asbestos
abatement workers and contractor/supervisors; and to effect a variety of other necessary changes as mandated by
section 15(a)(3) of the Asbestos School Hazard Abatement Reauthorization Act (ASHARA). This revised rule replaces
the original MAP found at 40 CFR part 763, Appendix C to Subpart E. The original MAP contained six components which,
taken together, comprised a model asbestos accreditation plan for States and EPA-approved training providers.
These components included: (1) Initial training, (2) examinations, (3) refresher training, (4) qualifications,
(5) decertification requirements, and (6) reciprocity. This revision adds two new components to the original MAP;
(1) definitions, which help to determine the scope and applicability of the rule, and (2) new recordkeeping requirements
for the providers of accredited training courses. The changes also specify the deadline for States to modify their
accreditation programs to be no less stringent than the revised MAP as required by the Toxic Substances Control Act
(TSCA) section 206(b)(2). Further, the revised MAP prescribes deadlines for training course providers and persons
who must obtain accreditation to comply with new requirements; distinguishes between the training requirements
for each of the five accredited training disciplines; adds several new topics to the project designer training curriculum;
establishes new enforcement criteria and Federal procedures for withdrawing approval from accredited persons
and training programs; and stipulates new information requirements for training certificates. Because the revisions
expand the minimum requirements for an accreditation plan, States may have to modify their programs to insure that
each State has a contractor accreditation plan that is at least as stringent as the revised MAP as required by TSCA section
206(b). Similarly, training providers may need to adjust their training course administration or curricula to comply
with the revised MAP. Finally, EPA has modified the organization, and some of the language of the original MAP. These
modifications, however, are technical, and do not impose new substantive requirements.

I. Background 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
In 1986, Congress enacted the Asbestos Hazard Emergency Response Act (AHERA, or TSCA Title II) which mandated a regulatory
program to address asbestos hazards in schools. A part of AHERA (section 206; 15 U.S.C. 2646) dealt with the mandatory
training and accreditation of persons who would perform certain types of asbestos-related work in schools. Subsequently,
in 1990, Congress enacted ASHARA (Pub. L. 101&hyph;637), which amended AHERA to extend some of the training and accreditation
requirements to persons performing such work in public and commercial buildings. Consequently, EPA is now effecting
regulatory changes to reflect and implement these statutory amendments. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Originally, section 206 of AHERA required EPA to develop a MAP providing for the training of certain types of persons
performing asbestos-related work in elementary and secondary schools (15 U.S.C. 2646). Persons covered by this
original MAP included those who inspected school buildings for asbestos-containing materials (ACM); developed
asbestos management plans for schools; and designed or conducted response actions with respect to friable ACM, other
than small-scale, short-duration activities, in schools. Such persons were required to obtain accreditation as
a prerequisite to performing this work. AHERA also required States to adopt a State accreditation program that was
no less stringent than that described in the MAP (15 U.S.C. 2646(b)(2)). Persons could then obtain accreditation
by completing either an EPA-approved training course, or a training course approved by a State with a program that
was at least as stringent as the MAP, and by passing an examination for that course. Individual States, however, could
elect to impose more stringent requirements as a condition of accreditation. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The original MAP established five accredited ``disciplines'' for asbestos-related activities in schools, which
included: worker, contractor/supervisor, inspector, management planner, and project designer. For each discipline,
it outlined a functional role and set of job responsibilities, and stipulated minimum training, examination, and
continuing education requirements. It established areas of knowledge of asbestos inspection, management plan
development, and response action technology that persons seeking accreditation must demonstrate and that States
must include in their accreditation programs. On November 28, 1990, Congress enacted ASHARA and expanded the accreditation
requirements to apply to persons who work with asbestos in public and commercial buildings as well as schools. Specifically,
ASHARA expanded TSCA section 206(a)(1) and (3) to require accreditation for any person who inspects for ACM in a public
and commercial building, or who designs or conducts a response action with respect to friable ACM in such a building.
As a result of this amendment, the MAP accreditation requirements for inspectors, project designers, workers, and
contractor/supervisors now apply equally to persons in both schools and public and commercial buildings. Congress,
however, did not extend the accreditation requirement for management planners. As a result, TSCA requires accreditation
for persons who prepare management plans if they work in schools, but does not require such accreditation if they work
in public and commercial buildings (15 U.S.C. 2646(a)(2)). 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
ASHARA also required EPA to revise the current MAP by increasing the minimum number of hours of training, including
hands-on training, required for asbestos abatement workers in both schools and public and commercial buildings.
ASHARA, however, did not specify the amount of additional training that would be required. In addition, ASHARA authorized
EPA to modify the MAP as necessary to implement the extension of accreditation requirements to public and commercial
buildings. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Finally, ASHARA amended the penalty provisions of TSCA section 207 (15 U.S.C. 2647). It provided for a civil penalty
for contractors who fail to comply with TSCA accreditation requirements by inspecting, designing, or conducting
a response action in a school or public or commercial building without TSCA accreditation, or by employing individuals
to conduct response actions in such a building, and failing to require or provide TSCA accreditation for the employees.
A contractor who commits a violation is liable for a civil penalty of $5,000 for each day of a violation, except for a
contractor who is a direct employee of the Federal Government (15 U.S.C. 2646 (g)). 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The ASHARA accreditation provisions originally were to take effect on November 28, 1991. ASHARA, however, authorized
EPA's Administrator to extend that effective date for one year. On January 7, 1992, the Administrator took action
to extend the effective date until November 28, 1992 (57 FR 1913, January 16, 1992). The Administrator determined
that accredited asbestos contractors were needed to perform school site abatement required under AHERA, and that
such an extension was necessary to ensure effective implementation of section 203 of TSCA (ASHARA section 15(c)).
As a result of this extension, persons who perform inspections, or plan or conduct response actions in public and commercial
buildings were required to obtain TSCA accreditation beginning on November 28, 1992. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
EPA has decided to phase-in the other new requirements contained in the revised MAP when the revision takes effect.
These requirements include an increase in the minimum number of hours of training, including hands-on training,
for asbestos abatement workers in both schools and public and commercial buildings, and other necessary revisions.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
EPA is promulgating the revised MAP as an interim final rule that will take effect 60 days after the rule is published.
The streamlined procedures that EPA has utilized to revise the MAP are fully consistent with the Congressional directive
to EPA for developing the original MAP. AHERA specifically authorized the Agency to issue the MAP ``after consultation
with affected parties'' (15 U.S.C. 2646(b)(1)(A)). EPA issued it after a public request for information in the 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 -->
Federal Register
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 (51 FR 28914, August 12, 1986) and consultations with affected parties, but without engaging in full-scale notice
and comment rulemaking. EPA has used procedures to revise the MAP that are as extensive as those that were used to develop
the original MAP. EPA believes it is reasonable to conclude that Congress did not intend EPA to engage in the redundancy
of consultation with affected parties and formal notice and comment rulemaking in either issuing the MAP or in revising
it, and therefore intended EPA to issue this revision to the MAP after undertaking similar consultations with affected
parties. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
EPA finds that there is good cause to issue an interim final rule, without utilizing all of the notice and public comment
procedures in section 553(b) of the Administrative Procedures Act (APA), because those procedures are impracticable
and unnecessary under the circumstances (5 U.S.C. 553(b)). It is impracticable to utilize the full-scale notice
and comment proceedings in section 553(b) because such proceedings would unjustifiably extend the rulemaking process,
and would further delay the implementation of the revised MAP. Congress clearly intended that EPA act expeditiously
to revise the MAP, and even established a deadline for the EPA revisions. EPA did not meet the deadline because of the
time-consuming process that was necessary to create an accreditation plan that would coordinate with existing,
diverse State accreditation programs, minimize disruption of current training providers, and contain other provisions
necessary to implement the revisions. If EPA were to develop and publish a notice of proposed rulemaking pursuant
to section 553(b), the revisions would have been even further delayed. The impact of such a delay would be exacerbated
by the additional time that is required for States to pass conforming legislation and implement the revised MAP after
it is issued. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Finally, full-scale rulemaking is unnecessary because EPA has communicated informally with affected parties,
given notice of the revisions to the public, and provided an opportunity to submit information and comments prior
to promulgating this interim final rule. Initially, the Agency consulted with affected organizations to identify
revisions that were necessitated by ASHARA. These organizations included schools, commercial building owners
and operators, asbestos abatement consultants and contractors, labor organizations, training providers, and
States. Subsequently, EPA published a notice in the 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 -->
Federal Register
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 that described the revisions that were being considered, and announced a public meeting to discuss the changes (57
FR 20438, May 13, 1992). 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
EPA also established a docket containing information which supports EPA's revision of the MAP. To provide interested
persons the opportunity for oral presentation of data, views, or arguments concerning the changes under consideration,
EPA held a public meeting on June 8, 1992, in Washington, DC. Twenty-three persons presented oral comments for the
record. A transcript of this proceeding is contained in the docket. EPA also received 80 written comments in response
to the 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 -->
Federal Register
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 announcement. These comments have also been filed in the docket, and were carefully considered by the Agency in revising
the MAP.

II. Summary of Changes 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The various new requirements of the MAP are described here in greater detail. This summary is organized by subject
area. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 -->
A. Definitions 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The promulgated revisions establish a new definitions section for the MAP. Seven terms are included to help clarify
and delineate the scope and applicability of the MAP to work performed in public and commercial buildings. The seven
terms, and their meanings, are summarized below: 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
1. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Public and commercial building.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 The term ``public and commercial building'' is defined in TSCA section 202(10) to mean ``any building which is not
a school building, except that the term does not include any residential apartment building of fewer than 10 units''
(15 U.S.C. 2642(10)). This definition identifies those buildings where persons performing certain asbestos-related
work are subject to the MAP training and accreditation requirements. Such buildings generally include apartment
complexes, condominiums and cooperatives of more than 10 units, office buildings, government-owned buildings,
colleges, museums, airports, hospitals, churches, preschools, stores, warehouses, and factories. It also includes
all industrial buildings, because industrial buildings are included within the broad statutory definition of public
and commercial buildings. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
This particular term does not include elementary or secondary schools as defined in section 198 of the Elementary
and Secondary Education Act of 1965 (20 U.S.C. 2854; 15 U.S.C. 2642(9) and (12)). The definition in the revised MAP
excludes all detached single family homes, because they are residential buildings of fewer than 10 dwelling units.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Furthermore, consistent with the statute and EPA's regulatory approach for schools, the term is interpreted to include
only the interiors of buildings except for exterior hallways connecting buildings, porticos, and mechanical systems
used to condition interior space. Consequently, accredited workers are generally not required for work on roofing
or siding materials that are on the outside of either public and commercial buildings or schools. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
2. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Friable asbestos-containing material (ACM)
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
. In TSCA section 202, friable asbestos-containing material means any material containing more than one percent
asbestos, which has been applied on ceilings, walls, structural members, piping, duct work, or any other part of a
building, which, when dry, may be crumbled, pulverized, or reduced to powder by hand pressure. The term includes non-friable
ACM after such previously non-friable material becomes damaged to the extent that when dry it may be crumbled, pulverized,
or reduced to powder by hand pressure'' (15 U.S.C. 2642(6)). At no point does the statute regulate activities that
involve nonbuilding materials, such as asbestos gloves or asbestos brake linings, that may be either stored or used
inside of a building. Consequently, the use of the term ``friable ACM'' in the MAP refers only to ``friable asbestos-containing
building material (ACBM),'' and, where the statute requires accreditation for activities associated with ACM,
accreditation is only required if the asbestos is part of the building. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
3. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Inspection
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
. Although AHERA required that schools conduct asbestos inspections, ASHARA did not extend this same requirement
to public and commercial buildings. Furthermore, because the Asbestos-Containing Materials in Schools Rule (``Schools
Rule'') (40 CFR 763.80&hyph;763.119) simply listed the various activities required to be included as a part of these
mandatory school inspections (40 CFR 763.85), without actually defining the term itself, a definition of ``inspection''
is necessary to delineate the scope of the MAP accreditation requirement as it applies to both schools and public and
commercial buildings. Accordingly, the term ``inspection'' is defined to mean those activities undertaken to specifically
determine the presence or location, or to assess the condition of, friable or non-friable ACBM or suspected ACBM,
whether by visual or physical examination, or by collecting samples of such material. Similarly, the term includes
all ``reinspections'' of friable and non-friable known or assumed ACBM which has been previously identified. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The inclusion of a definition for the term inspection is intended to clarify when a person must obtain TSCA accreditation
before performing an inspection. TSCA Title II, as amended by ASHARA, did not define inspection. When Congress enacted
ASHARA, however, the Schools Rule was in effect, and it identified the activities that constituted an inspection
in school buildings (40 CFR 763.85 and 763.92). The definition of inspection adopted in the revised MAP is based upon
the core inspection activities identified in the Schools Rule at &sect;763.85(a), including the visual or physical
examination, and the sampling of ACBM or suspected ACBM to determine its location or presence or to assess its physical
condition. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Based upon the revised MAP, a person must be accredited to engage in any one of these core activities in a school or in
a public and commercial building. In addition, the Schools Rule continues to require accreditation for any person
who engages in any one of these core activities. Because the Schools Rule currently requires an accredited person
to conduct the core inspection activities, and the revised MAP requires accreditation for those same activities,
the revision will not expand the need for accredited inspectors in schools. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The definition, however, also allows for three specific exceptions, dealing with related activities which do not
require accreditation. The three excepted activities include: periodic surveillance, compliance inspections,
and visual inspections. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The first exception under this term addresses periodic surveillance of the type described in 40 CFR 763.92(b), which
is commonly performed by custodial or maintenance workers. Periodic surveillance is distinct from reinspection
and is limited only to visual observations. It refers to a visual examination of an area in a building that previously
has been identified as containing ACBM, or that previously has been assumed to contain ACBM, and that is undertaken
to identify changes in the physical condition of that ACBM. Thus, a person would not need accreditation to visually
survey a ceiling that had already been identified in an earlier inspection or reinspection as suspected ACBM to determine
whether the ceiling had been damaged by a water leak. If the person assessed the condition of the ceiling by collecting
a sample, or touched it to determine whether it had become friable, however, then that person would have to be accredited
as an inspector. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The second type of activity that is excluded from the definition of inspection is compliance inspections performed
by Federal, State, or local regulatory agencies. These are excluded from accreditation because their primary purpose
is to determine adherence to applicable statutes or regulations, and not to locate, assess, or remedy the condition
of ACBM. TSCA Title II does not provide a clear definition of the types of inspection activities that require training.
The legislative history of ASHARA, however, indicates that Congress intended to require training only for those
persons who actually inspect for or abate asbestos in public and commercial buildings. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
See
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 136 Cong. Rec. S15304 (Oct. 15, 1990) (statement of Sen. Burdick). Based upon the purpose of ASHARA, EPA has concluded
that government personnel who inspect to determine compliance with laws regulating asbestos are not required to
obtain accreditation. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The third exception involves visual inspections of the type referenced in 40 CFR 763.90(i). These types of activities
are excluded from the accreditation requirement because their purpose is to determine whether a response action
is complete, not to actually inspect for asbestos. See 136 Cong. Rec. S15304 (Oct. 15,1990) (statement of Sen. Burdick).
Moreover, when Congress enacted ASHARA, it was aware that AHERA required accreditation for persons who inspected
for asbestos in schools. Persons who conducted visual inspections in schools to determine whether a response action
was complete, however, did not have to be accredited as inspectors. The legislative history of ASHARA indicates that
Congress did not intend to expand the categories of persons that had to be accredited when it modified the accreditation
requirements to include public and commercial buildings as well as schools. As noted by Senator Chafee: ``[ASHARA]
does not require the accreditation of any category of individuals not now required to be accredited to perform asbestos
abatement work [under AHERA].'' 136 Cong. Rec. S15309 (Oct. 15, 1990) (statement of Sen. Chafee). Consequently,
EPA has concluded that a person who conducts an inspection in a public and commercial building to determine whether
a response action is complete does not have to be accredited as an inspector. Of course, many persons performing such
activities will otherwise need accreditation as asbestos abatement workers or contractor/supervisors. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
4. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Response action.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 The term ``response action'' is defined in the MAP to mean a method, including removal, encapsulation, enclosure,
repair, and operation and maintenance, that protects human health and the environment from friable ACBM. This definition
is consistent with the definition of ``response action'' in TSCA section 202(11) (15 U.S.C. 2642(11)), and with the
definition of ``response action'' in the Schools Rule found at 40 CFR 763.83. Its incorporation into the revised MAP
will therefore ensure that it applies equally to regulated activities in both schools and public and commercial buildings.
Consequently, those activities that are response actions in schools will also now be response actions when and where
they are undertaken in public and commercial buildings. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Moreover, a person planning or conducting a response action is subject to the MAP accreditation requirements only
if the ACBM is friable (15 U.S.C. 2646(a)(3)). As defined in both the MAP and in TSCA section 202(6), ``friable ACM''
refers only to ACM that ``when dry, may be crumbled, pulverized, or reduced to powder by hand pressure'' (15 U.S.C.
2642(6)). It also includes previously ``nonfriable material after such previously non-friable material becomes
damaged to the extent that when dry, it may be crumbled, pulverized, or reduced to powder by hand pressure'' (15 U.S.C.
2642(6)). This statutory definition of friability thereby limits the scope of the accreditation requirements for
response actions in both schools and public and commercial buildings to ACBM that is friable or expected to become
friable during the course of the response action.

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Small-scale, short-duration activities.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 For purposes of the revised MAP, ``small-scale, short duration activities (SSSD)'' are tasks such as, but not limited
to: (a) Removal of asbestos-containing insulation on pipes, (b) removal of small quantities of asbestos-containing
insulation on beams or above ceilings, (c) replacement of an asbestos-containing gasket on a valve, (d) installation
or removal of a small section of drywall, or (e) installation of electrical conduits through or proximate to asbestos-containing
materials. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
SSSD can be further defined by the following considerations: (a) Removal of small quantities of ACM only if required
in the performance of another maintenance activity not intended as asbestos abatement, (b) removal of asbestos-containing
thermal system insulation not to exceed amounts greater than those which can be contained in a single glove bag, (c)
minor repairs to damaged thermal system insulation which do not require removal, (d) repairs to a piece of asbestos-containing
wallboard, or (e) repairs, involving encapsulation, enclosure, or removal, to small amounts of friable ACM only
if required in the performance of emergency or routine maintenance activity and not intended solely as asbestos abatement
(such work may not exceed amounts greater than those which can be contained in a single prefabricated mini-enclosure.
Such an enclosure shall conform spatially and geometrically to the localized work area, in order to perform its intended
containment function). 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
This definition is intended to establish a common exemption threshold for both schools and public and commercial
buildings that limits the applicability of the MAP training and accreditation requirements. All persons in schools
or public and commercial buildings who perform SSSD that do not otherwise meet the criteria for a major fiber release
episode under 40 CFR 763.91(f)(2) are exempt from the MAP accreditation requirements. However, a SSSD removal of
more than 3 square or linear feet of friable ACBM, where this amount of friable ACBM either falls or is dislodged, requires
the use of an accredited worker. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Major and minor fiber release episodes.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 To help clarify the applicability and limits of the SSSD exemption under the MAP, EPA is incorporating two additional
definitions for the terms ``Minor Fiber Release Episode'' and ``Major Fiber Release Episode.'' Consistent with
the Schools Rule (40 CFR 763.83 and 763.91(e), (f)), a minor fiber release episode is ``any uncontrolled or unintentional
disturbance of ACBM, resulting in a visible emission'' that ``involves the falling or dislodging of 3 square or linear
feet or less of friable ACBM.'' A major fiber release episode is ``any uncontrolled or unintentional disturbance
of ACBM, resulting in a visible emission'' that ``involves the falling or dislodging of more than 3 square or linear
feet of friable ACBM.'' The Schools Rule uses these terms, in addition to SSSD, as a means to distinguish between those
maintenance activities that require the use of accredited workers, and those that do not. These terms help delineate
when persons performing operation and maintenance activities are subject to MAP training and accreditation requirements.
Like SSSD, they are basic to determining the scope of the regulation, and have been added for that reason.

B. Phased Implementation 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
EPA has decided that it is necessary to phase-in the MAP revisions to achieve an orderly transition to the revised plan.
Additional time will be needed after the revised MAP has taken effect for States to adopt accreditation plans no less
stringent than the revised MAP, for training course providers to modify their training courses in keeping with upgraded
MAP standards, and for individuals to obtain new or additional training where applicable. For these reasons, the
revisions incorporate a timetable with two distinct deadlines; one that applies to States, and another for accredited
persons and training course providers. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
1. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
States.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 EPA believes that it is reasonable to allow States a comparable amount of time to come into compliance with the revised
MAP as was allowed under the original MAP. Therefore, the requirement of the original MAP, that each State must adopt
an accreditation plan at least as stringent as the EPA model plan within 180 days after the commencement of the first
regular session of the State's legislature following EPA's adoption of the model plan, is carried over to the revised
MAP. When Congress originally enacted AHERA, it required States to adopt such a plan, and established a deadline that
was tied to the timing of the first legislative session following completion of the MAP. When it promulgated ASHARA,
Congress did not modify TSCA section 206(b)(2) that requires States to have a plan at least as stringent as the MAP (15
U.S.C. 2646(b)(2)). When Congress enacted ASHARA, it was aware that States would need time to enact conforming State
legislation. It is reasonable to conclude that Congress intended to allow States the same amount of time to adopt implementing
legislation to comply with the MAP revisions in ASHARA that it had originally allowed for compliance with AHERA. The
deadline for State revisions of accreditation plans allows States the time that is needed to revise State laws. When
this deadline is combined with the other provisions to phase-in the MAP revisions, EPA believes that there will be
an orderly transition to the expanded system of accreditation for schools, and public and commercial buildings.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Some States already will have contractor accreditation programs that meet or exceed the upgraded MAP requirements
when the revised MAP takes effect. These States are essentially unaffected by the revisions, and may continue to operate
as before. A second group of States will not have accreditation programs in place that are as stringent as the revised
MAP when it first takes effect, but will have preexisting accreditation programs that are in compliance with the original
MAP. These State programs may or may not be approved by EPA under the revised MAP. Until such a State revises its program
to comply with the upgraded MAP standards, it will not have the authority to approve any new training courses to provide
training or accreditation that satisfies the requirements of TSCA section 206(a) (15 U.S.C. 2646(a)). In the interim,
however, the State may continue to train persons and issue the accreditation required by TSCA section 206(a) if the
State program otherwise complies with the minimum standards of the original MAP. The State also may continue its approval
of training course providers, if the State issued the approval before the effective date of the revised MAP, and the
training provider is in compliance with the self-certification requirements contained in Unit V.B. of the revised
MAP. This allows qualified training course providers to continue to train and issue accreditation that satisfies
TSCA section 206(a) requirements. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Some States in the second group will revise their accreditation program to be at least as stringent as the MAP within
180 days after the commencement of the legislature's first regular session that is convened after the effective date
of the revised MAP. When such a State achieves this program upgrade, it will regain the authority to approve new training
course providers. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Other States in the second group, however, may fail to meet the deadline for achieving the necessary program upgrade.
Beginning on their respective deadline dates, these States will no longer have the authority to train persons or issue
accreditation that satisfies the requirements of TSCA section 206(a), or to approve training course providers to
conduct TSCA training or issue TSCA accreditation. A training provider that had been approved by such a State automatically
loses its State approval. A training provider that loses State approval in this manner, however, will become EPA-approved
if the provider has self-certified and is otherwise in compliance with the revised MAP. Finally, such a State automatically
loses any EPA approval it may have had. Once lost, a State would need to reapply for such approval under the procedures
outlined in Unit II of the revised MAP. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
A third group of States will not have any accreditation program in place when the revised MAP takes effect, or will not
have a program which is at least as stringent as the original or revised MAP. These States are not in compliance with
TSCA Title II, are not authorized to train persons or issue accreditation that satisfy the requirements of TSCA section
206(a), and may not approve training course providers to conduct TSCA training or issue TSCA accreditation. EPA strongly
recommends that States apply for and retain EPA approval of their accreditation programs for the purpose of substantiating
their compliance status under TSCA Title II. Substantiation of compliance benefits all affected persons and organizations,
including States that may be considering reciprocal arrangements with other States. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
2. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Training course providers.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 The revised MAP stipulates that all approved training course providers, whether approved by EPA or a State, must self-certify
that they have upgraded their approved training programs to comply with the requirements of the revised MAP within
6 months of the revised MAP taking effect. The certification must be received by EPA on or before October 4, 1994. This
requirement applies across-the-board to all initial and refresher training courses in all five accredited disciplines
even though actual curriculum modifications are only required for the initial worker, contractor/supervisor,
and project designer courses. Self-certification is required for all courses and all disciplines because all training
providers must certify that they not only comply with the prescribed training course curricula, but with the new recordkeeping
and certificate provisions of the revised MAP as well. The self-certification process is to be accomplished by submitting
a written assurance to EPA that courses and programs have been appropriately modified. The self-certification must
be signed by an authorized representative of the training provider, and must include the following statement: ``Under
civil and criminal penalties of law for the making or submission of false or fraudulent statements or representations
(18 U.S.C. 1001 and 15 U.S.C. 2615), I certify that the training described in this submission complies with all applicable
requirements of Title II of TSCA, 40 CFR part 763, Appendix C to Subpart E, as revised, and any other applicable Federal,
state, or local requirements.'' The self-certification submission must also include documentation adequately
describing the course and program modifications effected to achieve compliance with the revised MAP. Training providers
with multiple course approvals are encouraged to certify all such courses through a single consolidated submission.
Complete duplicate copies of self-certifications must also be sent to and received by any State approving offices
as of the same deadline date. Training courses that have not self-certified as of October 4, 1994, will no longer be
approved, and must reapply through a State Program which is no less stringent than the revised MAP to have their approval
status restored. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
As was previously announced in the 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 -->
Federal Register
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 (54 FR 38802, September 20, 1989), EPA stopped accepting new training course applications from providers for review
and contingent approval as of October 15, 1989. Since that date, all training courses without approval have had to
apply directly to State Programs with accreditation plans no less stringent than the original MAP in order to obtain
the necessary approval. Once a training course has been self-certified, a training provider may continue to offer
that training course pursuant to the revised MAP. If the course had initially been approved by an EPA-approved State,
and that State subsequently forfeits its EPA-approved status, EPA will continue to recognize the training course
as being an approved course if it has been self-certified and otherwise remains in compliance with the revised MAP.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
3. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Accredited persons.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 The revisions grandfather all persons who possess valid accreditation as of the day before the date upon which the
revised MAP goes into effect. A person is considered to have valid accreditation if they are in possession of an accreditation
certificate that has not yet expired. If a State allows a person with an expired certificate to reinstate accreditation
by completing refresher training within the 12&hyph;month grace period, then such a person will also be considered
to have valid accreditation for purposes of grandfathering. The person must successfully complete the necessary
refresher training course within 12 months of the date their certificate expires. Persons who do not meet either of
the above conditions do not possess valid accreditation, and will not be grandfathered for purposes of accreditation
under the revised MAP. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Grandfathered persons will not have to repeat initial training in order to perform work subject to accreditation,
but will have to continue to fully comply with all annual refresher training requirements. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Persons who do not possess valid accreditation as of the day before the date upon which the revised MAP goes into effect
have two alternative means of obtaining initial accreditation. A person may take an upgraded training course, and
obtain accreditation that complies with the revised MAP. Alternatively, a person may take a course that was approved
under the original MAP and obtain provisional accreditation. However, this person must then also complete the upgraded
training course for the same discipline within 6-months of the revised MAP taking effect, on or before October 4, 1994,
in order to obtain accreditation that complies with the revised MAP and to continue working beyond that date. This
mechanism will ensure that all persons who become newly accredited after the revised MAP takes effect will meet the
upgraded training standards within 6 months, while at the same time, making it possible for all persons to acquire
a provisional accreditation and continue to work during the 6&hyph;month transition period when training providers
are upgrading their courses and programs. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
From earlier consultations with training providers, EPA anticipates that many, if not most, will have little or no
difficulty transitioning to the upgraded training course standards (OPPTS Docket No. 62107, Log No. B2&hyph;002).
For worker and contractor/supervisor courses, this involves extending hands-on training from 6 to 14 hours. For
the project designer course, it involves revising instructional materials as necessary to accomodate curriculum
changes. For the inspector and management planner courses, there are no required curriculum changes per se. Because
many training providers already comply with the new recordkeeping and certificate requirements as a matter of standard
business practice, these adjustments are not expected to be burdensome. Development and submittal of the self-certification
letter, by design, should also be a relatively simple task. In addition, EPA expects that once the revised MAP has gone
into effect, demand for the upgraded training courses in favor of the original courses will provide sufficient market
incentive for a significant number of training providers to self-certify quickly, thereby expediting an infrastructure
shift from the old courses to the new. The examples below are intended to help illustrate how accreditation will operate
during the transition period. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
a. Person ``A'' obtains initial accreditation as a worker 1&hyph;month before the revised MAP takes effect. This
person is then grandfathered in when the revised MAP goes into effect 1&hyph;month later. The person must then complete
worker refresher training within 11 months after the revised MAP takes effect in order to continue accreditation
status unbroken. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
b. Person ``B'' is a non-accredited consultant who is awarded an asbestos abatement contract 4 months after the revised
MAP takes effect. This person is able to find and quickly complete an upgraded contractor/supervisor course, thereby
obtaining initial accreditation. This person has met the new training standards, and thus is unaffected by the 6&hyph;month
compliance deadline. The consultant must then satisfy the refresher training requirement within 1&hyph;year of
the initial accreditation date in order to continue uninterrupted contractor/supervisor work. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
c. Person ``C'' is a non-accredited consultant who is awarded a contract for project design 1-month after the effective
date of the revised MAP. This person is unable to find an upgraded training course, so opts to take the old initial project
designer training course and begin contract work without undue delay. This person may begin work, but must complete
an upgraded project designer course within the 6-month compliance deadline in order to continue working in an uninterrupted
manner. A consultant who does not complete the upgraded training course by the compliance deadline must then stop
work that requires TSCA accreditation until obtaining upgraded accreditation. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The same transitional provisions apply to any person who seeks initial accreditation after the revised MAP takes
effect, including inspectors and management planners. The revised MAP imposes certain new requirements on all disciplines,
specifically new recordkeeping and certificate requirements. EPA has concluded that everyone who is initially
accredited after the revised MAP takes effect should be subject to the same transitional provisions to insure that
their training and accreditation will be adequately documented as required by the new rule, and that they will have
certificates that contain all the necessary information. Such uniformity will make the accreditation requirements
easier to comply with and enforce.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 -->
C. Distinct Training Disciplines 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
These MAP revisions reaffirm the principle that each of the five accredited training disciplines in the MAP is distinct
from the others. Because each discipline reflects a different functional job role, proficiency in any one of the five
disciplines requires a different mix of knowledge, skill, and ability. Even where training programs cover common
subjects, these same subjects need to be given a different priority and emphasis depending upon the particular discipline
a person is being trained for. To ensure that each discipline receives adequate training, the revisions have incorporated
the following changed requirements. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
1. Each initial and refresher training course offered for accreditation must be specific to a single discipline,
and not combined with training for any other discipline. The past practice of training providers offering combined
worker and contractor/supervisor training is not allowed.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
2. Workers are no longer permitted to ``upgrade'' their worker accreditation to that of contractor/supervisor by
completing only one additional day of training. Separate initial training as a contractor/supervisor is now required.
Accredited contractor/supervisors, however, may perform as workers without obtaining separate accreditation
as such. This is because contractor/supervisors have received more training in the aggregate than workers to ensure
that they can perform their more complex job functions, and they must otherwise know how to perform all of the various
tasks which workers are normally called upon to perform. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
3. Persons completing initial training for accreditation as contractor/supervisors are no longer permitted to
work as accredited project designers during their initial 1-year term of accreditation. This dual-accreditation
provision, found in section I.1.C. of the original MAP, has been deleted from the revised MAP. Persons seeking accreditation
as contractor/supervisors must now complete the new 5&hyph;day initial training for contractor/supervisors,
and persons seeking accreditation as project designers must now complete the new 3&hyph;day initial training for
project designers. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 -->
D. Increased Training Requirements 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Section 15(a)(3) of ASHARA mandated that EPA, as a part of revising its MAP, increase the minimum number of training
hours, including additional hours of hands-on health and safety training, required for the accreditation of asbestos
abatement workers in schools and public and commercial buildings. EPA interprets the phrase ``asbestos abatement
workers'' to include both workers and contractor/supervisors. These groups have the greatest need for additional
hands-on training because they either actually perform asbestos abatement work, or directly oversee it at the job
site. The revised MAP therefore incorporates 1 additional 8&hyph;hour day of hands-on training for both the worker
and the contractor/supervisor disciplines. This has the effect of increasing the worker course from a total of 3 days
to 4 days of training, with the hands-on training component increased from 6 hours to 14 hours. Similarly, the 4&hyph;day
contractor/supervisor course has been upgraded to a 5&hyph;day course, with 14 hours of hands-on activity. These
training hour requirements not only fulfill the statutory mandate for additional hands-on training for asbestos
abatement workers, but also ensure that training can be obtained within the practical limits of a normal 40&hyph;hour,
5&hyph;day work-week. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The minimum training hour requirements for the other three accredited MAP disciplines, that of inspector, management
planner, and project designer have not been altered. Congress only mandated increased training for asbestos abatement
workers, and the only accredited disciplines directly engaged in hands-on abatement work are the worker and contractor/supervisor.
The project designer and management planner courses do not include any hands-on health and safety training component.
Because inspectors likewise do not participate in abatement, the existing 4-hour hands-on component for inspectors
is unaffected by the ASHARA mandate. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 -->
E. Expanded Project Designer Curriculum 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The MAP revisions incorporate several additions to the mandatory curriculum for accredited project designer training,
but do not extend the required length of this initial training program. These changes relate only to the scope of training;
they do not require an accredited project designer to perform any particular work practices. Because of concerns
that project designs may sometimes be either inadequately prepared and/or executed, the curriculum additions are
aimed at both clarifying and improving the effectiveness of the project designer's functional role (see OPPTS Docket
No. 62107, Log No. C1&hyph;030). Where no written design plan exists, implementation can be prone to failure. This
may also occur where a project design has not adequately considered all relevant facets of an abatement project. For
these reasons, the six new topics which have been added include: (1) The need for and methods of preparing a written
project design, (2) techniques for completing an initial cleaning of the work area, (3) increased emphasis on the
rationale behind the establishment of functional spaces, (4) the need for written diagrams and methods of diagraming
all containment barriers, (5) the need for a written sampling rationale for air clearance, and (6) clarification
of what constitutes a complete visual inspection. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 -->
F. Deaccreditation of Persons and Withdrawal of Course Approval 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The MAP revisions establish minimum national criteria for suspending or revoking the accreditation of individuals
as well as for suspending or withdrawing the approval of training courses. Also included are additional criteria
that EPA may use, and States are free to adopt, as well as the procedures that EPA will follow when suspending, revoking,
or withdrawing accreditation or approval. The specified procedures are derived from those used for the suspension,
modification, or revocation of pesticide applicator certificates found at 40 CFR 171.11(f). EPA believes that these
procedures provide adequate notice and process to affected individuals and training course providers, while enabling
the Agency to act more quickly than through those procedures specified at 40 CFR part 22, which had also been considered
by the Agency. States, in initiating these kinds of actions, would be bound by the requirements of their own State administrative
procedures. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The enumeration of criteria for suspension, revocation, or withdrawal is not meant to be a complete list of enforcement
actions and choices available to EPA. Since the MAP is a regulation promulgated under Title II of TSCA, persons violating
the MAP may also be subject to assessment of civil administrative penalties. The MAP revisions also clarify that EPA
may take independent actions against either training entities or accredited persons, without reliance upon State
enforcement authority or initiative. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
1. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Deaccrediting persons.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 Four minimum criteria are established for triggering deaccreditation actions by EPA or a State. They include: (1)
Performing work requiring accreditation at a job site without being in physical possession of initial and current
accreditation certificates; (2) permitting the duplication or use of one's own accreditation certificate by another;
(3) performing work for which accreditation has not been received; or (4) obtaining accreditation from a training
provider that does not have approval to offer training for the particular discipline from either EPA or from a State
that has a contractor accreditation plan at least as stringent as the EPA MAP. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
EPA may also suspend or revoke a person's accreditation if such person has been found in violation of other asbestos
regulations administered by EPA. States may wish to adopt this criterion, or modify it to include their own asbestos
statutes or regulations. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In addition, the revised MAP identifies some of the situations when a person who is performing an activity that requires
accreditation will be subject to civil penalties under TSCA. Examples include, but are not limited to: (1) Obtaining
accreditation through fraudulent representation of training or examination documents; (2) obtaining training
documentation through fraudulent means; (3) gaining admission to and completing refresher training through fraudulent
representation of initial or previous refresher training documentation; or (4) obtaining accreditation through
fraudulent representation of accreditation requirements such as education, training, professional registration,
or experience. This list is not exhaustive, and there may be other situations where persons may be subject to penalties
under TSCA by conducting work without the requisite accreditation. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
2. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Withdrawal of course approval.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 This new provision requires that States have minimum criteria and procedures for suspending or withdrawing approval
from approved training courses. In pursuing actions for withdrawal of approval of accredited training programs,
States should follow their own State administrative procedures. EPA may directly pursue actions for withdrawal
of approval of accredited training programs without reliance on State withdrawal actions or enforcement authority
or actions. In taking such actions, EPA will use the same procedures specified for the suspension or revocation of
accreditation, those found at 40 CFR 171.11(f), to suspend or withdraw approval of a training course. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
EPA continues to have the ability to withdraw approval of accredited training programs if field site inspections
indicate that a training course is not conducting training that meets the requirements of the EPA MAP. Similarly,
the requirement that training course providers permit EPA representatives to attend, evaluate, and monitor any
training course without charge to EPA is preserved. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
EPA believes that training providers should understand the criteria that the Agency will use to trigger a withdrawal
action. Minimum criteria which trigger the commencement of a withdrawal action for withdrawal of approval of accredited
training programs have been added to the MAP, including: (a) Misrepresentation of the extent of a training course's
approval by a State or EPA; (b) failure to submit required information or notifications in a timely manner; (c) failure
to maintain requisite records; (d) falsification of accreditation records, instructor qualifications, or other
accreditation information; or (e) failure to adhere to the training standards and requirements of the EPA or State
MAP as appropriate. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
EPA may also suspend or withdraw a training course's approval if an approved training course instructor or other person
with supervisory authority over the delivery of training has been found in violation of other asbestos regulations
administered by EPA. An administrative or judicial finding of violation, or execution of a consent agreement and
order under 40 CFR 22.18, constitutes evidence of a failure to comply with relevant statutes and regulations. States
may wish to adopt this additional criterion, or modify it to include their own asbestos statutes or regulations. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The formal procedures for withdrawing course approval do not apply to training providers that fail to comply with
the self-certification requirements of the revised MAP and that do not upgrade their courses within 6 months of the
effective date of the revised MAP. EPA is provisionally allowing training providers to continue to operate during
that 6-month period pursuant to approval granted under the original MAP. A training provider that fails to comply
with the self-certification requirements within 6 months, however, automatically loses its provisional approval
by operation of law. No individual notices or adjudicative process is required to effect the loss of such provisional
approvals pursuant to this rule.

G. Recordkeeping Requirements for Training Providers 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The revised MAP imposes a variety of new recordkeeping requirements on training providers that are necessary to strengthen
compliance with MAP training standards and to enable more vigorous enforcement of those standards by both EPA and
the States. Four different types of records must be maintained: (1) Records documenting approved training course
materials (e.g., copies of student manuals, instructor notebooks, handouts), (2) records demonstrating instructor
qualifications (e.g., copies of resumes, approval letters, dates and names of courses taught), (3) records documenting
examinations (e.g., copies of tests used, individual student scores, dates and locations of exams given), and (4)
records documenting accreditation certificates (e.g., to whom conferred, for which disciplines, dates of issuance
and expiration). The revisions further stipulate that all such records must be retained for at least 3 years, and that
reasonable access to all such records must be provided upon request to either or both EPA and the States. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 -->
H. Accreditation Certificates 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The revised MAP stipulates that each accreditation certificate issued by an approved training provider must now
contain certain additional items of information which had not been specified in the original MAP. The new minimum
certificate standard is intended to enable quick identification of and contact with the training provider that issued
the certificate. The revised MAP specifically requires the inclusion of the issuing provider's name, address, and
telephone number. This mechanism makes it possible for training providers, regulatory agencies, and the general
public to verify the accreditation status of persons performing work subject to the MAP.

Comments on the various MAP changes being considered by EPA were received from many affected interest groups, including
States, commercial buildings owners and managers, labor organizations, trade associations, asbestos contractors
and consultants, training entities, power companies, universities, and federal agencies other than EPA. These
written comments may be found in the docket supporting this action (OPPTS&hyph;62107). This Unit discusses EPA's
responses to the significant issues raised in the comments received.

Public and commercial buildings.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 Many commenters urged EPA to incorporate the NESHAP (40 CFR part 61 - National Emission Standards for Hazardous Air
Pollutants) definition of ``facility,'' so that greater consistency might be achieved between the various EPA asbestos
rules. Although EPA is sympathetic to promoting regulatory integration whenever feasible, the statutory language
of TSCA section 202(10) complicates this attempt. A regulated ``facility'' under the NESHAP includes residential
buildings of more than four units, whereas the TSCA definition of ``public and commercial building'' includes residential
apartment buildings of 10 or more units. Because EPA's mandate to issue and revise the MAP comes from TSCA, as amended
by ASHARA, the TSCA definition is controlling. EPA must use the TSCA definition, even though it is less inclusive than
NESHAP. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Other commenters suggested that the definition of the term ``public and commercial building'' should include ACM
that is located both on the insides and the exteriors of buildings. EPA had earlier examined this same issue when it
promulgated the Schools Rule and the original MAP pursuant to AHERA. At that time, EPA concluded that when AHERA used
the phrase ``in a school building,'' it meant the interior of the building, not the exterior (52 FR 41835, October 30,
1987). EPA adopted that interpretation in the Schools Rule which was in effect when Congress amended AHERA by enacting
ASHARA. EPA believes that Congress intended the term ``in'' a public or commercial building to be given the same meaning
as ``in'' a school building in the Schools Rule. Consistent with the approach incorporated in the Schools Rule, training
is required for work in interior areas only, except for exterior hallways connecting buildings, porticos, and mechanical
systems used to condition interior space. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Several power companies and other industrial/manufacturing concerns objected to the Agency's proposal to include
``industrial'' buildings within the scope of the rule. They argued that the public generally does not have access
to these buildings, is therefore not exposed, and that workers in these industrial buildings are already adequately
protected by the OSHA asbestos standards or the EPA Worker Protection Rule. The accreditation requirements of the
statute, however, clearly extend to activities in industrial buildings. TSCA section 202(10) defines ``public
and commercial buildings'' expansively to mean ``
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
any
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 building which is not a school building, except the term does not include any residential apartment building of fewer
than 10 units'' (15 U.S.C. 2642(10)) (emphasis added). The statutory definition includes all buildings with only
two express exclusions for school buildings and residential buildings. Industrial buildings clearly do not qualify
for either exemption. Thus, they fall within the category of any other type of building that is encompassed by the term
``public and commercial building.'' Moreover, when Congress enacted ASHARA, it relied, in part, upon EPA's assessment
of risk in public and commercial buildings, an assessment that included industrial buildings. EPA's 1988 Report
to Congress on Asbestos in Buildings specifically identified industrial buildings as one of the types of structures
included under the TSCA definition of ``public and commercial buildings'' (Report to Congress, page 2). Further,
the inclusion of industrial buildings in the category of buildings where training is required is consistent with
the purpose of ASHARA to protect workers as well as the public. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In extending the MAP training and accreditation requirements to public and commercial buildings under the ASHARA
mandate, EPA recognizes that the revised MAP will now apply to activities in buildings that may be subject to the specific
training requirements of other Federal asbestos regulations. This includes the competent person training requirements
under the OSHA Asbestos Standard (29 CFR 1926.58) and the EPA Worker Protection Rule (40 CFR 763.121), the on-site
representative training requirements under the asbestos NESHAP (40 CFR 61.145), and the training requirements
for designated persons and operations and maintenance personnel found in the Schools Rule (40 CFR 763.84&hyph; 763.92).
EPA wishes to clarify that a person subject to the accredited training requirements of the MAP will also remain subject
to the applicable training requirements of these other asbestos rules. Compliance with the MAP does not automatically
relieve a person of responsibilities under other asbestos rules.

Friable ACM.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 Several commenters, citing the need for regulatory consistency between schools and public and commercial buildings,
urged the Agency to preserve the concept of friable ACM which had been applied in the Schools Rule. EPA agrees with this
approach because it is consistent with the statutory mandate and because consistency between the Schools Rule and
the MAP is desirable. Both rules must comply with the same TSCA section 202(6) definition of friable ACM. Thus, the
Agency has incorporated that definition into the MAP. This ties the definition to ACBM that is or may become friable.

Inspection

that would embrace all eight of the options outlined in the May 13, 1992 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 -->
Federal Register
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 notice (57 FR 20438). This expansive approach would not only extend accreditation requirements to include general
environmental hazard assessments for insurance and real estate purposes, but also would specifically extend those
requirements to all of the inspection-type activities required by other asbestos rules such as the Schools Rule,
NESHAP, the EPA Worker Protection Rule and the OSHA Asbestos Standard. EPA believes that such an all encompassing
definition is not warranted based upon risk, and would therefore result in unnecessary costs (see OPPTS Docket No.
62107, Log Nos. C1&hyph;025, C1&hyph;035, C1&hyph;038). EPA has elected a more targeted approach which focuses
on both the object and the activity of inspecting for asbestos. The statute limits the accreditation requirement
to those persons who ``inspect for ACM in school buildings...or in a public or commercial building'' (15 USC 2646 (a)(1)).
EPA has adhered to this statutory language, and required accreditation only for those persons who inspect or reinspect
specifically for ACBM. This would include, however, an inspection undertaken pursuant to NESHAP (40 CFR 61.145(a))
in a school, or public and commercial building, where the building owner or operator is required to thoroughly inspect
the building for the presence of asbestos prior to commencing a demolition or renovation activity. Similarly, inspections
required by other regulations would also be subject to accreditation, if the inspection, as defined in the revised
MAP, included a component that was specific to ACBM, and was conducted within a school, or public and commercial building
subject to the revised MAP. This includes more general inspection-type activities (e.g., environmental assessments)
where asbestos is one of several potential hazards or materials that are being looked for or examined. Regardless
of what other activities a person may be undertaking, if the person is inspecting for ACBM in a school, public, or commercial
building, that person must be accredited to perform the asbestos inspection component of that activity. Conversely,
if a person is performing an environmental assessment or building inspection that does not include an asbestos inspection
component, that person does not require asbestos accreditation to perform that activity. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
As described earlier in Unit II.A.3. of this preamble, other specific exceptions to the inspection accreditation
requirement include; (1) persons performing periodic surveillance of the type described in 40 CFR 763.92(b), (2)
compliance-related inspections performed by employees or agents of Federal, State or local government, and (3)
visual inspections of the type described in 40 CFR 763.90(i) for purposes of determining the completion of a response
action.

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Response action
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
. Commenters overwhelmingly supported a definition for response action that would treat this term the same way both
for schools and for public and commercial buildings. EPA agrees with this approach because it provides regulatory
consistency between the MAP and the Schools Rule. Because many of the same contractors will be performing abatement
work in both schools and public and commercial buildings, the use of the same standard for both will further promote
comprehension of and compliance with the new accreditation requirements. The definition in the revised MAP is therefore
the same as that which appears in the Schools Rule. Consequently, if a response action were undertaken in a school,
and the same activity was then undertaken in a public or commercial building, both activities would be considered
response actions, and both activities would be required to engage the services of accredited workers unless specifically
excluded under the exemption for small-scale, short-duration activities. It should be noted, however, that there
are other aspects relating to the conduct of response actions which may be different for schools than for public and
commercial buildings. One example would be the requirements found at 40 CFR 763.90 for air clearance at the completion
of a response action which are applicable to such activities in schools but not in public and commercial buildings.

Small-scale, short-duration activities (SSSD)
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
. A majority of commenters supported the extension of the existing Schools Rule training exemption for SSSD work in
schools to public and commercial buildings (see 40 CFR 763, Appendix B to Subpart E). EPA agrees with the use of this
exemption in the revised MAP, because it both preserves regulatory consistency and promotes compliance with the
statute. Also, absent such a threshold exemption, a great many persons involved in operation and maintenance-type
activities in buildings would have to be specially trained, regardless of risk.

Major and minor fiber release episodes
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
. A common theme among those commenting on the prospective incorporation of an SSSD exemption into the MAP was that
this concept lacked clarity, and was therefore difficult to interpret and apply. EPA is responding to this concern
in two ways. First, by using the existing SSSD exemption from the Schools Rule, the MAP will apply the same accreditation
exemption to all buildings (schools and public and commercial buildings) and thereby minimize any potential confusion
among the regulated community. Secondly, by adding the definitions of major and minor fiber release episodes, the
Agency is seeking to provide the clearest possible meaning to this exemption while keeping it entirely within the
framework established by the Schools Rule.

1. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
States
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
. Several State commenters expressed concern that an allowance of 180 days following their next legislative session
would not provide them with sufficient time to upgrade their programs in keeping with the increased training requirements
of ASHARA. Although EPA acknowledges the difficulties inherent with transitioning established State programs,
the changes were mandated by Congress when it enacted ASHARA. Furthermore, the relatively short timeframes established
in ASHARA for EPA to implement these training mandates clearly communicated a desire and intent for prompt action.
For these reasons, EPA believes that it is reasonable to allow States a comparable amount of time to come into compliance
with the revised MAP as had been allowed for under the original MAP. This provides each State with an allowance of 180
days following the convening of their next regular legislative session to adopt a State accreditation plan that is
no less stringent than the revised MAP. For some States with legislatures that meet every year, this means they will
have a period of time not less than 6 months in which to implement these changes. For other States whose legislatures
meet every other year, it means these States might have as long as 30 months to effect the changes.

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Training course upgrades
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
. Most commenters supported the 6&hyph;month compliance deadline for training course upgrades which EPA had proposed.
They also supported self-certification on the part of training entities as an efficient and practical way of quickly
implementing the new standards. Other commenters, however, contended that the 6&hyph;month deadline was either
too short or too long, and expressed concerns about the ability of EPA and/or the States to properly audit these upgraded
training programs. EPA considers the course upgrades prescribed in the revised MAP to be fully achievable within
a 6-month timeframe. The revisions directly affect only 3 of the 5 basic courses, and none of the refresher courses.
The initial worker and contractor/supervisor training courses must each incorporate 1 additional day of hands-on
training and the initial project designer courses must expand their curriculum to incorporate the 6 additional items
specified in the revisions. The original training provider self-certifications under ASHARA will be submitted
directly to EPA's Headquarter's Office in Washington, DC., so that this data can be quickly compiled at the national
level and integrated with existing data bases. This simplified and centralized process expedites course upgrades
to ensure that the new training courses will be widely available within a short period of time. EPA and/or the States
may then follow-up with field audits of these training programs as resources permit.

3. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Accredited persons
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
. Most commenters expressed support for the Agency's proposal to grandfather in all those persons who are in possession
of valid accreditation as of the day before the effective date of the revised MAP. Many also suggested that everyone
else should be allowed more than 6 months to obtain valid accreditation based upon the increased ASHARA training requirements.
In contrast, a few suggested that a transition period of less than 6 months would be sufficient. Because of the fairly
simple adjustments needed to upgrade training courses, and because EPA is providing an expedited procedure (through
self-certification) for purposes of obtaining course provider upgrade approval, the Agency considers the 6-month
deadline for obtaining new accreditation to be adequate. Persons who are already accredited on the date the revised
MAP takes effect are not directly impacted by it. Upon reaching their annual expiration date, they will take their
annual refresher training course, as before, and their accreditation will be extended for an additional year. Persons
seeking new accreditation on and after the effective date of the revised MAP, however, will need to complete either
an existing course that complies with the original MAP and thereby obtain provisional accreditation, or an upgraded
course that complies with the revised MAP to obtain regular accreditation. If a person takes an existing course, that
person will have to complete the upgraded training course within 6 months after the revised MAP takes effect in order
to sustain their accreditation and continue working. This provision helps ensure that anyone needing to obtain initial
accreditation during the period of transition between the original MAP and the revised MAP will have the opportunity
to do so. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Several commenters suggested that the MAP requirements for refresher training should also be increased along with
the basic requirements. This might be accomplished by either extending the length of mandatory refresher training,
or expanding its curriculum, or both. EPA does not agree with this position, however, and believes that actual work
experience is at least equivalent to requiring additional hands-on training as a basis for reaccreditation. At the
time of refresher training, most accredited persons should have already acquired on-the-job experience at least
equivalent to what this refresher hands-on training might otherwise provide. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 -->
C. Distinct Training Disciplines 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
While a majority of commenters agreed with the general principle of separate training courses, many also believed
that an exception should be made in the case of combined worker/supervisor training. These parties pointed to the
common elements in the prescribed training curricula for these two disciplines as the primary reason for allowing
joint training. In this view, workers and supervisors would attend the same course, with the contractor/supervisors
coming back for 1 additional day of training after the worker curriculum had been completed. Although EPA permitted
this accomodation for a period of time under the original MAP, the Agency has now decided that, in light of the Congressional
mandate to strengthen and improve asbestos-related training programs, contractor/supervisors may no longer obtain
accreditation by attending the same training course as workers with a 1 day add-on. Contractor/supervisors have
markedly different job functions and responsibilities than workers. While many training elements are common to
these two disciplines, each discipline requires presentation at a different degree of complexity and level of detail,
depending upon whether a person is in training to become a worker, or in training to become a supervisor. An on-site
foreman, unlike a worker, must know how each of the workers should perform his/her individual assigned tasks, and
must also comprehend the total job to be done. As a result, a contractor/supervisor requires more in-depth training
on each of the training elements than does a worker. By way of illustration, ``regulatory review'' is one curriculum
training element that is common to both the worker and the supervisor courses. Where a worker must have a general understanding
of the bounds established by asbestos regulations, the supervisor, as the on-site person responsible for regulatory
compliance, must have a much greater depth of knowledge regarding these rules and the methods of complying. If supervisors
attend the same training course as workers, and are provided the same lecture on ``regulatory review,'' not only is
it likely that the workers in this class will get more regulatory training than they need (and possibly less of something
else more relevant to their jobs), but more importantly, the supervisors will not get the right mix of subject matter
depth and breadth. EPA believes, therefore, that the best way to ensure that contractor/supervisors receive the
specialized training they need is to keep their training courses separate and distinct from those of workers. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
EPA believes, however, that it is permissible to allow an accredited contractor/supervisor to perform in the role
of an accredited worker without possessing separate worker accreditation. Separate worker accreditation is unnecessary
because the contractor/supervisor must essentially know all that the worker knows and more, and the contractor/supervisor
has also completed more training than the worker (5 days as opposed to 4 days). 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The situation is different, however, with respect to dual accreditation for contractor/supervisors and project
designers. Because these two training disciplines share little in common, EPA is now eliminating the original MAP
provision whereby persons completing contractor/supervisor initial training could obtain dual accreditation
to work as both contractor/supervisors and project designers. After the effective date of the revisions, all persons
must take separate initial and refresher training that is specific to their discipline in order to obtain or retain
valid accreditation.

D. Increased Training Requirements 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
EPA had solicited public comment on the number of additional hours of training that would be appropriate for the revised
MAP because ASHARA had left this amount unspecified. Whereas commenters suggested a variety of ways in which this
might be accomplished, many expressed support for EPA's proposal to require one additional 8&hyph;hour day of hands-on
training for the worker and the contractor/supervisor initial training courses respectively. The length of all
other training courses is not affected by the revisions. There are a number of distinct advantages to EPA's approach:
(1) All MAP training courses would be limited in length to no more than one 5&hyph;day business week, a period of time
adequate to accomplish the requisite training, (2) existing training course materials would remain relevant and
not require extensive modifications, (3) additional hands-on training should appropriately be given to those persons
who actually perform hands-on abatement work (i.e., workers and contractor/supervisors), and (4) the addition
of 8 hours of hands-on training (on top of 6 hours that are already required) should be relatively simple for providers
to achieve, yet affords them a degree of flexibility in deciding how to go about doing it (i.e., in selecting the particular
hands-on activities to be practiced or exercised). 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Several commenters with experience in training, representing, or employing asbestos workers agreed that 8 additional
hours of hands-on training for workers and contractor/supervisors was advisable. They noted that the additional
day of training was necessary to allow workers to practice their jobs under actual working conditions, to gain necessary
experience in performing tasks such as erecting and dismantling containment barriers, glovebagging, and scaffolding,
and in working inside containment areas, or while wearing personal protective equipment, or in other common workplace
situations (see OPPTS Docket No. 62107, Log Nos. C1&hyph;016 and C1&hyph;020). Commenters also noted that the additional
day of hands-on training would help acclimatize workers without risk of exposure, and also would eliminate complaints
regarding the need for on-the-job training (OPPTS Docket 62107, Log Nos. C1&hyph;020 and C1&hyph;064).

E. Expanded Project Designer Curriculum 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
A majority of commenters agreed with EPA's proposal to broaden the prescribed project designer training curriculum
to include six additional lecture elements without extending the minimum required length of the course. The six elements
have therefore been added, and include: (1) The need for, and methods of preparing a written project design, (2) techniques
for completing an initial cleaning of the work area, (3) increased emphasis on the rationale behind establishment
of functional spaces, (4) the need for written diagrams and methods of diagraming all containment barriers, (5) the
need for a written sampling rationale for air clearance, and (6) clarification of what constitutes a complete visual
inspection. These revisions have each been incorporated as additions to the initial project designer training curriculum.
They will improve the effectiveness of the accredited training programs, and thereby help to ensure that project
designers will be fully prepared to perform work in both schools and public and commercial buildings.

F. Withdrawal of Accreditation and Course Approval 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Broad support also was expressed for EPA's proposal to incorporate minimum Federal criteria for proceedings relating
to the deaccreditation of persons and the withdrawal of approval from accredited training courses, and to adopt standardized
procedures for such actions. These changes had been proposed to: (1) Promote greater consistency and predictability
nationwide, and (2) clarify the manner by which EPA might directly deaccredit individuals or training courses without
reliance upon State authority or activity. The criteria have therefore been promulgated as minimum Federal criteria
which the States must match or exceed in their own programs. The procedures govern EPA activities only; the States
being left free to adhere to their own internal administrative procedures pursuant to State law.

G. Recordkeeping Requirements for Training Providers 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Several commenters stated that a records retention period longer than 3 years would be preferable for compliance
verification purposes. EPA, however, consistent with other TSCA recordkeeping requirements (i.e., 40 CFR 704.11
and 761.180), regards a minimum 3&hyph;year retention period as adequate for this purpose, and appropriate when
consideration is given to the costs associated with records maintenance. These 3 years are adequate to ensure that
records will be available for anyone who needs to verify either initial or refesher accreditation status. Even if
a person obtained initial accreditation, and then took advantage of a full 12&hyph;month grace period before obtaining
refresher training, the 3&hyph;year retention requirement would ensure that the training provider has the records
to verify the initial accreditation. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
A number of training providers also expressed concerns about access; surmising that if their records were opened
in an unrestricted manner to the public, that such providers would become vulnerable to burdensome or harrassing
requests. They did not object, however, to training provider records being open to EPA and the States (see OPPTS Docket
No. 62107, Log No. D1-001). EPA accepts this position, and it has been incorporated into the revisions (see Unit I.F.6.
of the revised MAP). This would not preclude the public from seeking information directly from the training provider
through telephone inquiries or requests, but would permit training schools to maintain a measure of flexibility
in responding to inquiries. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
EPA also had asked for comments about whether training providers should be required to verify the accreditation status
of students enrolling in their courses. In reply, several training entities commented that this could present a significant
burden that should not be imposed (OPPTS Docket 62107, Log Nos. C1-019 and C1-041). After considering this information,
EPA agrees, and the revised MAP includes a recommendation rather than a requirement that training entities verify
the accreditation status of students enrolling in their courses. Regarding the more general question of whether
or not recordkeeping requirements should be imposed, many commenters acknowledged the need for this action and expressed
support for EPA's position.

H. Accreditation Certificates 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
While most commenters expressed support for EPA's proposal to require additional training provider information
on accreditation certificates (i.e., issuer's name, address, and telephone number), a few suggested that other
items might be required as well, including the name of the course instructor and the photograph, social security number,
and signature of the person to whom accreditation is being conferred. The Agency does not consider these other items
to be necessary on certificates, because the same information is generally available through other sources. The
names of course instructors are otherwise provided through the recordkeeping requirements contained in the revisions,
and personal identification items such as photographs, social security numbers, and signatures are commonly available
on the professional licenses issued by State programs.

Project monitor training and accreditation
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
. Several parties indicated that EPA should expand the MAP to include mandatory accreditation for a sixth training
discipline, that of ``Project Monitor.'' The functional role of a project monitor is often specific to a particular
response action; but generally might include: (1) Monitoring a response action for compliance with contract/job
specifications and regulatory requirements, (2) performing visual audits of a job site before, during and after
a response action is undertaken, and (3) performing air monitoring as a part of a response action or for purposes of
clearing a response action. Depending upon the particular mix of activities undertaken by the project monitor, this
person might otherwise require accreditation, particularly if they somehow become directly involved in conducting
any part of the response action. Typically, however, the project monitor is an agent or employee representing a building
owner or manager who is engaged to oversee a contractor's performance of a response action in a school or public or commercial
building. These commenters argue that because such persons are already widely used, steps should be taken to ensure
a minimum level of competency. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
ASHARA did not grant the Agency a clear mandate to enlarge the scope of federal accreditation to include additional
training disciplines. Furthermore, implementing this course would necessitate more extensive changes to State
programs and statutes, a consequence which would hinder State efforts to comply with ASHARA. For these reasons, EPA
has incorporated a recommended training curriculum for such persons into the revised MAP and is urging States to consider
adopting this curriculum for purposes of requiring project monitor accreditation under State law or regulation.
Such State laws would not mandate that project monitors be used in every instance, but rather, would require their
accreditation whenever a building owner or manager elected to employ the services of a project monitor. This curriculum
was developed in 1992 through a roundtable discussion which involved numerous affected interests outside of EPA.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 (March 20, 1992), outlined a recommended 5&hyph;day training program. Even where States choose not to require accreditation
under their State Plans for such persons, EPA recommends that training entities consider offering this course, and
suggests that professionals working in this capacity seek out and obtain this or equivalent training.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Operations and maintenance training and accreditation
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
. A few commenters suggested that persons responsible for SSSD operations and maintenance (O&amp;M) activity involving
ACBM should be subject to MAP training and accreditation requirements. They noted that while &sect;763.92(a) of
the Schools Rule requires school maintenance personnel to take special ``awareness'' training, and, in some instances,
additional O&amp;M training, the MAP would not require training for all maintenance personnel in public and commercial
buildings. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
This difference in training requirements is based upon the statutory training scheme that Congress established
in Title II of TSCA. Both the language of the statute, and the legislative history of AHERA and ASHARA support EPA's
decision not to require MAP accreditation for all O&amp;M personnel in public and commercial buildings. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
When Congress enacted AHERA in 1986, it required MAP training and accreditation for persons who conducted response
actions, but excluded certain types of O&amp;M activities from the MAP training requirement (15 U.S.C. 2643(f),
2644(c), and 2646(a)(3)). It also required EPA to promulgate rules to regulate O&amp;M programs in schools, and required
local education agencies to develop and implement O&amp;M plans, and to provide for the education of service and maintenance
personnel with respect to asbestos-containing material. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
EPA promulgated the Schools Rule pursuant to AHERA. The Schools Rule does not require full MAP training and accreditation
for all O&amp;M workers, but does require it for any person in a school who: (a) Conducts a response action other than
a SSSD activity (40 CFR 763.90(g)); (b) performs a maintenance activity that disturbs friable ACBM, other than a SSSD
activity (40 CFR 763.91(e)); or (c) conducts a response action for a major fiber release episode (40 CFR 763.91(f)(2)(iii)).

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In addition, the Schools Rule requires less extensive training for O&amp;M school employees that are not performing
an activity that falls within one of the three categories (40 CFR 763.92(a)). This last category of O&amp;M employee
does not have to be accredited. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Subsequently, in 1988, Congress amended AHERA, and created a new provision of TSCA, section 215, specifically to
codify the O&amp;M training requirements of the Schools Rule (15 U.S.C. 2655). Now, TSCA section 215 requires ``proper
training'' for school employees who conduct O&amp;M activities in a school (15 U.S.C. 2655(b)). 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In 1990, Congress further modified TSCA asbestos training requirements when it enacted ASHARA. Congress expanded
the MAP training requirements to cover persons working in public and commercial buildings, but it did not require
MAP training and accreditation for all persons who perform O&amp;M activities in such buildings. First, Congress
left intact the original language in TSCA section 206(a) that exempts many persons who conduct O&amp;M response actions
from MAP training and accreditation requirements in both schools and public and commercial buildings (15 U.S.C.
2646(a)(3)). In the second place, Congress chose not to expand the coverage of TSCA section 215 and require limited
training for O&amp;M employees in public and commercial buildings. Finally, unlike the original AHERA that governs
schools, Congress did not require EPA to promulgate rules regulating O&amp;M programs in public and commercial buildings,
nor did it require employers in such buildings to provide for the education of service and maintenance personnel with
respect to asbestos-containing material. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In keeping with these Congressional actions, EPA has not required MAP training and accreditation for every O&amp;M
worker in public and commercial buildings. Rather, the revised MAP requires MAP accreditation where O&amp;M workers
are most at risk. O&amp;M personnel must obtain MAP accreditation when conducting a response action, including a
maintenance activity that disturbs friable ACBM, unless that activity is a SSSD activity, or when conducting a response
action for a major fiber release.

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Management plans for public and commercial buildings
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
. A few commenters, noting that ASHARA section 15(a) specifically omitted management planners from the accredited
disciplines being extended to public and commercial buildings, suggested that management plans should otherwise
be required for such buildings. Although EPA, consistent with its manage-in-place policy articulated in the ``Green
Book'' guidance (see 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Managing Asbestos In Place: A Building Owner's Guide to Operations and Maintenance Programs for Asbestos-Containing
Materials
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
, EPA No. 20T&hyph;2003, July 1990), considers management plans to be helpful tools in preventing asbestos exposures,
the Agency is not requiring management plans for regulated buildings in this revision. ASHARA did authorize EPA to
establish training standards for asbestos workers, but it did not authorize the Agency to require public and commercial
building owners to conduct asbestos-related work in a particular fashion. However, for those regulated public and
commercial buildings where asbestos-related problems are identified through inspections, EPA strongly recommends
that plans be prepared for how to address these issues. EPA's Green Book should prove to be a useful reference in this
respect. The Agency would also suggest that accredited management planners be engaged for purposes of developing
such plans to ensure their adequacy. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Use of accredited laboratories
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
. Several commenters expressed concerns about the prospective quality of analytical work to be performed with respect
to public and commercial buildings, noting that EPA's announcement of additions and changes under consideration
had not mentioned the use of accredited laboratories for the analysis of bulk and/or air samples taken from such buildings.
TSCA section 206(d) provides for the establishment of the National Institute of Standards and Technology National
Voluntary Laboratory Accreditation Program (NVLAP), and stipulates that only laboratories accredited under this
program will be allowed to conduct analyses of asbestos bulk and air samples taken from school buildings under the
authority of local education agencies (15 U.S.C. 2646(d)). But Congress did not extend this same requirement to the
analysis of bulk or air samples taken from regulated public and commercial buildings. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
EPA strongly recommends that these samples be analyzed by NVLAP-accredited laboratories because these laboratories
have undergone Federal evaluation and testing and have met stringent performance standards. Further, EPA urges
that asbestos abatement site air be analyzed by transmission electron microscopy (TEM) prior to building reoccupancy
in a manner consistent with 40 CFR 763.90 (i)(3) and (4). This position is in keeping with EPA's on-going activity in
schools where the allowance for the use of phase contrast microscopy (PCM) has been greatly diminished. EPA strongly
recommends that abatement site air clearance samples collected from public and commercial buildings be analyzed
by TEM at NVLAP-accredited laboratories. EPA now considers the technically superior TEM analysis to be both economical
and widely available. TEM is technically superior to PCM because it is capable of measuring all asbestos fibers including
those thin fibers not measured by PCM; therefore, TEM is the more stringent analytical tool to be used for analysis
of airborne asbestos during abatement site air clearance.

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Instructor qualifications
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
. Some commenters were of the opinion that EPA had not gone far enough in establishing minimum qualifications for training
course instructors. The original MAP stipulated that instructors needed to have academic training or field experience
in asbestos abatement, yet allowed State programs to adopt their own more stringent qualification standards. Since
promulgation of the original MAP, many States have elected to institute their own instructor qualification requirements,
a fact which would now complicate any Federal effort to retroactively establish new minimum standards. EPA considers
this to be an issue best left to the States to decide. So long as course instructors demonstrate relevant training and
experience, and the knowledge and ability to provide effective instruction in the prescribed curriculum, EPA will
continue to view such persons as meeting minimum standards. States are encouraged, however, to review this issue
as they upgrade their programs in keeping with ASHARA. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
A related issue had also been raised independently by the General Accounting Office (GAO) in a May 1991, Report to Congress
entitled ``EPA's Asbestos Accreditation Program Requirements Need Strengthening.'' In this report, GAO had recommended
that EPA assess, in conjunction with its MAP revision, the need for requiring individuals working in the asbestos
professions to meet prequalification and experience standards. Although EPA responded to this comment by reevaluating
this issue and discussing it with affected organizations, the fact that at least 17 States had already adopted widely
varying prequalification standards posed a potentially significant obstacle (Source: State Asbestos Programs
Related to AHERA; A Survey of State Laws and Regulations. National Conference of State Legislatures. September,
1992) (OPPTS Docket No. 62107, Log No. B1&hyph;024). These States had established their own prequalification standards
for asbestos control professionals in response to EPA's earlier recommendation (contained in the original MAP)
that they should consider doing so. Consequently, any action by EPA to retroactively impose new Federal minimum standards
would add to the cost and difficulty of transitioning these State Programs into compliance with the revised MAP. Such
an outcome would not be helpful in promoting ASHARA's objective to achieve a decentralized program administered
by the 50 States. For this reason, EPA decided not to require new minimum prequalification standards in the revised
MAP. Nonetheless, in support of this goal, EPA has increased its experience requirements through incorporation
of an additional day of hands-on training in both the initial worker and contractor/supervisor training programs,
and is renewing/continuing its recommendation that States adopt other appropriate prequalification standards
of their own.

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Foreign language courses
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
. Several commenters suggested the need for specific requirements or accomodations for foreign language courses,
citing the significant numbers of non-English speaking persons who are now seeking accredited training. EPA policy
permits approved worker training courses in languages other than English so long as the course instruction, all of
the course materials, and the course examination are each presented in the same foreign language. Given the lack of
a uniform distribution of non-English speaking persons nationwide, with different languages prevailing in different
regions of the country, the MAP will continue to allow States to adopt their own standards and procedures in this regard
to address their individual and unique circumstances. EPA does, however, urge States to address these issues, and
to accomodate the needs of their respective non-English speaking populations.

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Standard forms
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
. Some commenters remarked that the use of standardized forms for purposes of inspection reports and management plans
would not only contribute to greater consistency and professionalism among accredited persons working with these
tools, but might also facilitate the development of reciprocal arrangements between State programs. EPA agrees
with these comments, and has incorporated specific recommendations into the training curricula for both inspectors
and management planners which are aimed at promoting greater usage of standardized forms. EPA recommends that States
consider the utility of adopting requirements for the use of standardized forms as an integral part of their asbestos
regulatory programs.

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Federal recognition of State programs
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
. Several State commenters indicated that it is beneficial for a State to formally apply for and obtain Federal recognition
of its accreditation plan. TSCA Title II specifically requires States to adopt accreditation plans that are no less
stringent than the MAP, but does not require them to obtain formal EPA approval. Even though EPA approval is not statutorily
required, it is beneficial. Where a State adopts and implements an accreditation program but does not obtain EPA approval,
it is difficult for the industry and other States to determine whether such a State program complies with minimum Federal
requirements and thus has the authority to issue TSCA accreditation. Where a person obtains a license from an unrecognized
State, that person's credentials may not be readily accepted by an employer, a contractor, or another State in which
the person might seek to find work, because absent EPA's approval, there is uncertainty about whether such a person
is properly accredited. In contrast, EPA's approval of a State effectively resolves all of this uncertainty. EPA
agrees with these comments, and strongly recommends that all States seek formal EPA approval of their accreditation
programs.

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Grace period for accreditation reinstatement
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
. Other comments were received regarding whether there should be a ``grace period'' during which a person can complete
refresher training within 12 months of their certificate expiration date and have their accreditation reinstated.
Such a person would not be required to retake the full initial training program for that discipline. Some States expressed
support for this approach, while one suggested there should be a penalty for persons who fail to obtain their refresher
training on-time (i.e., before the certificate expiration date). EPA believes that the 12&hyph;month grace period
is appropriate. If a person takes their refresher training too early in their accreditation year, they are penalized
through a shortening of what would otherwise be a 12&hyph;month period. If they are unable to enroll in a refresher
course precisely when they need it, at a location which is convenient, the grace period allows them the opportunity
to take the course at a later, more convenient time. During the 12&hyph;month grace period, however, it should be emphasized
that the person is not accredited, and may not otherwise perform the work that requires accreditation until they complete
their refresher training. EPA views this as being a sufficient penalty for not obtaining the required refresher training
in a timely manner. Because the 12&hyph;month grace period has proven helpful to the industry, and effective in preserving
a sizeable, accredited workforce nationwide, the Agency plans to not only continue this procedure, but also to encourage
States to adopt it for their programs as well. Consequently, the revised MAP now contains a formal recommendation
that State programs take this approach. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
10. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Accreditation program adoption by the U.S. Department of Defense
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
. In commenting on EPA's proposed changes to the MAP, the Department of the Navy noted that it operates its own in-house
asbestos training program which it believes complies with the accreditation requirements of the MAP. For this reason,
the Navy suggested that EPA might formally review and approve the Navy's training program so that Defense Department
employees could become accredited through the Defense program, and therefore not need separate accreditation from
a State. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
ASHARA requires accreditation for all persons who perform certain types of asbestos-related work in public and commercial
buildings, and defines that type of building very broadly. As a result, EPA has concluded that Federal employees who
perform inspections or design or conduct response actions in government buildings must be accredited. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Under section 203(l) of TSCA, the Secretary of Defense is authorized to act in lieu of a State Governor with respect
to any school operated under the Defense Dependents' Education Act of 1978 (20 U.S.C. 921 et seq.). This authority
allows the Secretary of Defense the opportunity to adopt its own accreditation program no less stringent than the
EPA MAP for the purpose of accrediting Defense Department employees performing asbestos-related work in these schools.
Although this might be accomplished in cooperation with EPA, the statute does not make the validity of the Defense
Department's plan for schools contingent upon EPA approval. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
ASHARA, however, did not extend this accreditation authority given to the Secretary of Defense to cover Defense Department
employees performing asbestos-related work in public and commercial buildings. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
With respect to the Navy's in-house training courses, the Navy may apply for approval of its training courses in the
same manner as any other training provider. This would permit the Navy to accredit any of its employees who might complete
these approved training courses. However, because EPA is no longer accepting new courses for review and contingent
approval (see 54 FR 38802), only those States with accreditation programs no less stringent than the MAP are in a position
to grant approval for such courses.

IV. Economic Impact 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The regulatory impact analysis estimates the costs and benefits attributable to this regulation. Because this regulation
is an amendment to a current regulation, the costs and benefits are incremental, estimating the additional effect
of the regulation with respect to the current regulation. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The costs associated with this regulation are quantified; the benefits are discussed in qualitative terms and are
expected to be of significant importance. EPA believes this rule achieves the benefits mandated by Congress at a modest
cost. The rule affects training providers, asbestos workers, asbestos abatement and inspection companies, building
owners, general building workers and occupants, State governments, and the Federal government. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The benefits associated with this rule involve reductions in exposure to asbestos fibers due to the use of knowledgeable
individuals to work with asbestos and the use of safer work practices. The increased training requirements are expected
to increase the knowledge of the trained individuals. The population most affected by this regulation is the asbestos
professionals engaged in inspections and abatements, of which there are about 200,000 individuals who are required
to be trained under this regulation for work in public and commercial buildings. These individuals are expected to
benefit the most from this regulation due to the amount of time spent working with ACBM. EPA estimates that there are
0.4 to 1.2 million public and commercial buildings with ACBM, in which there are between 14 and 43 million employees
and workers who will gain a greater degree of protection either through the use of trained contractors or their own
education. Other employees and building occupants will gain a greater degree of protection through the use of appropriate
and correctly applied work practices. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The costs associated with this rule are well documented. Upgrading courses, retaining records, and allowing access
to records increase costs for training providers. Most of these costs are passed through in the form of higher charges
for the courses that are offered. In the first year, EPA estimates that the overall increase in course costs would be
between $2.3 million and $14.2 million. Training provider burden for recordkeeping and allowing access to their
records would be $200,000 to $250,000 for the first year. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Training providers estimate that 70 percent of the asbestos-related abatement work done in public and commercial
buildings already uses trained individuals. An analysis of the supply and demand of accredited asbestos professionals
in each of the four disciplines extended to public and commercial buildings illustrates that the national supply
is sufficient to accommodate the anticipated demand. Early estimates of supply and demand for project designers
suggested a potential for shortfall, and this conclusion provided a basis for delaying implementation of this rule
(57 FR 1913, January 16, 1992). 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
This rule requires the owners of public and commercial buildings to utilize accredited workers to inspect for ACBM,
and to design and carry-out response actions with respect to friable ACBM, unless exempted under the SSSD threshold.
EPA believes that most building owners will elect to hire outside contractors rather than train their own people to
comply with this requirement, resulting in an annual cost of $2 million to $45 million for the estimated 374,000 to
1.23 million buildings which will be affected. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Both State and Federal governments incur costs due to this rule. For the first year, State governments incur a cost
of just under $4 million, while EPA incurs a cost of between $70,000 and $130,000. These costs are due to updating and
reviewing State programs and reapproving training courses. Overall costs for the first year for this rule are estimated
to be between $8 million and $64 million. These costs are summarized below. Discounting over a 20&hyph;year period
at 7 percent yields a present value cost estimate between $33 million and $458 million.

Under Executive Order 12866 (58 FR 51735, October 4, 1993), the Agency must determine whether the regulatory action
is ``significant'' and therefore subject to review by the Office of Management and Budget (OMB)). Under section 3(f),
the order defines a ``significant regulatory action'' as an action that is likely to result in a rule (1) Having an annual
effect on the economy of $100 million or more, or adversely and materially affecting a sector of the economy, productivity,
competition, jobs, the environment, public health or safety, or State, local or tribal governments or communities
(also referred to as ``economically significant''); (2) creating serious inconsistency or otherwise interfering
with an action taken or planned by another agency; (3) materially altering the budgetary impacts of entitlement,
grants, user fees, or loan programs or the rights and obligations of recipients thereof; or (4) raising novel legal
or policy issues arising out of legal mandates, the President's priorities, or the principles set forth in this Executive
Order. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Pursuant to the terms of this Executive Order, it has been determined that this rule is not ``significant'' and is therefore
not subject to OMB review.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Pursuant to the Regulatory Flexibility Act (5 U.S.C. 605(b)), the Administrator certifies that this revised rule
will not have a significant impact on a substantial number of small businesses. Virtually all of the States already
have some type of asbestos certification program now in effect. Nationwide, many thousands of persons are presently
completing accredited training programs each year. A discussion of EPA's analysis of the economic consequences
of this interim final rule appears in Unit IV. of this notice.

OMB has approved the information collection requirements contained in the existing rule under the provisions of
the Paperwork Reduction Act (44 U.S.C. 3501 et seq.), and assigned OMB control number 2070&hyph;0091. The information
collection requirements included in this rule that differ from those previously approved, have been submitted to
OMB as an amendment to OMB control number 2070&hyph;0091. Upon OMB's approval of this amendment to the existing approval,
EPA will publish a notice in the

 announcing such approval. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
This collection of information requires training providers and States to respond. For training providers, public
reporting for this collection of information is estimated to average 42 hours per response. This includes the time
for reviewing the regulation, making required changes to training programs, preparing and submitting a self-certification
package, maintaining records, and providing access to those records. There is no recordkeeping burden associated
with maintaining the records as their maintenance is usual and customary business practice. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
For States, public reporting for this collection of information is estimated to average 402 hours per response. This
includes the time for reviewing the regulation, comparing the new requirements with the current State program, completing
any necessary regulatory or legislative analysis, adopting new legislation or regulations, preparing and submitting
an application for program approval, and implementing an updated State program. For States, there is no recordkeeping
burden associated with this collection of information. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

A. Definitions 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->
For purposes of Appendix C: 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
1. ``Friable asbestos-containing material (ACM)'' means any material containing more than one percent asbestos
which has been applied on ceilings, walls, structural members, piping, duct work, or any other part of a building,
which when dry, may be crumbled, pulverized, or reduced to powder by hand pressure. The term includes non-friable
asbestos-containing material after such previously non-friable material becomes damaged to the extent that when
dry it may be crumbled, pulverized, or reduced to powder by hand pressure. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
2. ``Friable asbestos-containing building material (ACBM)'' means any friable ACM that is in or on interior structural
members or other parts of a school or public and commercial building. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
3. ``Inspection'' means an activity undertaken in a school building, or a public and commercial building, to determine
the presence or location, or to assess the condition of, friable or non-friable asbestos-containing building material
(ACBM) or suspected ACBM, whether by visual or physical examination, or by collecting samples of such material. This
term includes reinspections of friable and non-friable known or assumed ACBM which has been previously identified.
The term does not include the following: 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
a. Periodic surveillance of the type described in 40 CFR 763.92(b) solely for the purpose of recording or reporting
a change in the condition of known or assumed ACBM; 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
b. Inspections performed by employees or agents of Federal, State, or local government solely for the purpose of determining
compliance with applicable statutes or regulations; or 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
c. visual inspections of the type described in 40 CFR 763.90(i) solely for the purpose of determining completion of
response actions. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
4. ``Major fiber release episode'' means any uncontrolled or unintentional disturbance of ACBM, resulting in a visible
emission, which involves the falling or dislodging of more than 3 square or linear feet of friable ACBM. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
5. ``Minor fiber release episode'' means any uncontrolled or unintentional disturbance of ACBM, resulting in a visible
emission, which involves the falling or dislodging of 3 square or linear feet or less of friable ACBM. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
6. ``Public and commercial building'' means the interior space of any building which is not a school building, except
that the term does not include any residential apartment building of fewer than 10 units or detached single-family
homes. The term includes, but is not limited to: industrial and office buildings, residential apartment buildings
and condominiums of 10 or more dwelling units, government-owned buildings, colleges, museums, airports, hospitals,
churches, preschools, stores, warehouses and factories. Interior space includes exterior hallways connecting
buildings, porticos, and mechanical systems used to condition interior space. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
7. ``Response action'' means a method, including removal, encapsulation, enclosure, repair, and operation and
maintenance, that protects human health and the environment from friable ACBM. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
8. ``Small-scale, short-duration activities (SSSD)'' are tasks such as, but not limited to: 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
a. Removal of asbestos-containing insulation on pipes. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
b. Removal of small quantities of asbestos-containing insulation on beams or above ceilings. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
c. Replacement of an asbestos-containing gasket on a valve. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
d. Installation or removal of a small section of drywall. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
e. Installation of electrical conduits through or proximate to asbestos-containing materials. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
SSSD can be further defined by the following considerations: 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
f. Removal of small quantities of ACM only if required in the performance of another maintenance activity not intended
as asbestos abatement. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
g. Removal of asbestos-containing thermal system insulation not to exceed amounts greater than those which can be
contained in a single glove bag. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
h. Minor repairs to damaged thermal system insulation which do not require removal. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
i. Repairs to a piece of asbestos-containing wallboard. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
j. Repairs, involving encapsulation, enclosure, or removal, to small amounts of friable ACM only if required in the
performance of emergency or routine maintenance activity and not intended solely as asbestos abatement. Such work
may not exceed amounts greater than those which can be contained in a single prefabricated mini-enclosure. Such an
enclosure shall conform spatially and geometrically to the localized work area, in order to perform its intended
containment function. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=71 g=1 f=1 -->
B. Initial Training 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->
Training requirements for purposes of accreditation are specified both in terms of required subjects of instruction
and in terms of length of training. Each initial training course has a prescribed curriculum and number of days of training.
One day of training equals 8 hours, including breaks and lunch. Course instruction must be provided by EPA or State-approved
instructors. EPA or State instructor approval shall be based upon a review of the instructor's academic credentials
and/or field experience in asbestos abatement. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Beyond the initial training requirements, individual States may wish to consider requiring additional days of training
for purposes of supplementing hands-on activities or for reviewing relevant state regulations. States also may
wish to consider the relative merits of a worker apprenticeship program. Further, they might consider more stringent
minimum qualification standards for the approval of training instructors. EPA recommends that the enrollment in
any given course be limited to 25 students so that adequate opportunities exist for individual hands-on experience.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
States have the option to provide initial training directly or approve other entities to offer training. The following
requirements are for the initial training of persons required to have accreditation under TSCA Title II. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Training requirements for each of the five accredited disciplines are outlined below. Persons in each discipline
perform a different job function and distinct role. Inspectors identify and assess the condition of ACBM, or suspect
ACBM. Management planners use data gathered by inspectors to assess the degree of hazard posed by ACBM in schools to
determine the scope and timing of appropriate response actions needed for schools. Project designers determine
how asbestos abatement work should be conducted. Lastly, workers and contractor/supervisors carry out and oversee
abatement work. In addition, a recommended training curriculum is also presented for a sixth discipline, which is
not federally-accredited, that of ``Project Monitor.'' Each accredited discipline and training curriculum is
separate and distinct from the others. A person seeking accreditation in any of the five accredited MAP disciplines
cannot attend two or more courses concurrently, but may attend such courses sequentially. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In several instances, initial training courses for a specific discipline (e.g., workers, inspectors) require hands-on
training. For asbestos abatement contractor/supervisors and workers, hands-on training should include working
with asbestos-substitute materials, fitting and using respirators, use of glovebags, donning protective clothing,
and constructing a decontamination unit as well as other abatement work activities. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=74 g=1 f=1 -->
1. Workers 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->
A person must be accredited as a worker to carry out any of the following activities with respect to friable ACBM in a
school or public and commercial building: (1) A response action other than a SSSD activity, (2) a maintenance activity
that disturbs friable ACBM other than a SSSD activity, or (3) a response action for a major fiber release episode. All
persons seeking accreditation as asbestos abatement workers shall complete at least a 4&hyph;day training course
as outlined below. The 4&hyph;day worker training course shall include lectures, demonstrations, at least 14 hours
of hands-on training, individual respirator fit testing, course review, and an examination. Hands-on training
must permit workers to have actual experience performing tasks associated with asbestos abatement. A person who
is otherwise accredited as a contractor/supervisor may perform in the role of a worker without possessing separate
accreditation as a worker. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Because of cultural diversity associated with the asbestos workforce, EPA recommends that States adopt specific
standards for the approval of foreign language courses for abatement workers. EPA further recommends the use of audio-visual
materials to complement lectures, where appropriate. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The training course shall adequately address the following topics:

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->
A person must be accredited as a contractor/supervisor to supervise any of the following activities with respect
to friable ACBM in a school or public and commercial building: (1) A response action other than a SSSD activity, (2)
a maintenance activity that disturbs friable ACBM other than a SSSD activity, or (3) a response action for a major fiber

at least a 5&hyph;day training course as outlined below. The training course must include lectures, demonstrations,
at least 14 hours of hands-on training, individual respirator fit testing, course review, and a written examination.
Hands-on training must permit supervisors to have actual experience performing tasks associated with asbestos
abatement. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
EPA recommends the use of audiovisual materials to complement lectures, where appropriate. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Asbestos abatement supervisors include those persons who provide supervision and direction to workers performing
response actions. Supervisors may include those individuals with the position title of foreman, working foreman,
or leadman pursuant to collective bargaining agreements. At least one supervisor is required to be at the worksite
at all times while response actions are being conducted. Asbestos workers must have access to accredited supervisors
throughout the duration of the project.

6. Project Monitor 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->
EPA recommends that States adopt training and accreditation requirements for persons seeking to perform work as
project monitors. Project monitors observe abatement activities performed by contractors and generally serve
as a building owner's representative to ensure that abatement work is completed according to specification and in
compliance with all relevant statutes and regulations. They may also perform the vital role of air monitoring for
purposes of determining final clearance. EPA recommends that a State seeking to accredit individuals as project
monitors consider adopting a minimum 5&hyph;day training course covering the topics outlined below. The course
outlined below consists of lectures and demonstrations, at least 6 hours of hands-on training, course review, and
a written examination. The hands-on training component might be satisfied by having the student simulate participation
in or performance of any of the relevant job functions or activities (or by incorporation of the workshop component
described in item ``n'' below of this unit). 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=71 g=1 f=1 -->
C. Examinations 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->
1. Each State shall administer a closed book examination or designate other entities such as State-approved providers
of training courses to administer the closed-book examination to persons seeking accreditation who have completed
an initial training course. Demonstration testing may also be included as part of the examination. A person seeking
initial accreditation in a specific discipline must pass the examination for that discipline in order to receive
accreditation. For example, a person seeking accreditation as an abatement project designer must pass the State's
examination for abatement project designer. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
States may develop their own examinations, have providers of training courses develop examinations, or use standardized
examinations developed for purposes of accreditation under TSCA Title II. In addition, States may supplement standardized
examinations with questions about State regulations. States may obtain commercially developed standardized examinations,
develop standardized examinations independently, or do so in cooperation with other States, or with commercial
or non-profit providers on a regional or national basis. EPA recommends the use of standardized, scientifically-validated
testing instruments, which may be beneficial in terms of both promoting competency and in fostering accreditation
reciprocity between States. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Each examination shall adequately cover the topics included in the training course for that discipline. Each person
who completes a training course, passes the required examination, and fulfills whatever other requirements the
State imposes must receive an accreditation certificate in a specific discipline. Whether a State directly issues
accreditation certificates, or authorizes training providers to issue accreditation certificates, each certificate
issued to an accredited person must contain the following minimum information: 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
a. A unique certificate number 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
b. Name of accredited person 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
c. Discipline of the training course completed. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
d. Dates of the training course. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
e. Date of the examination. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
f. An expiration date of 1 year after the date upon which the person successfully completed the course and examination.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
g. The name, address, and telephone number of the training provider that issued the certificate. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
h. A statement that the person receiving the certificate has completed the requisite training for asbestos accreditation
under TSCA Title II. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
States or training providers who reaccredit persons based upon completion of required refresher training must also
provide accreditation certificates with all of the above information, except the examination date may be omitted
if a State does not require a refresher examination for reaccreditation. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Where a State licenses accredited persons but has authorized training providers to issue accreditation certificates,
the State may issue licenses in the form of photo-identification cards. Where this applies, EPA recommends that the
State licenses should include all of the same information required for the accreditation certificates. A State may
also choose to issue photo-identification cards in addition to the required accreditation certificates. Accredited
persons must have their initial and current accreditation certificates at the location where they are conducting
work. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
2. The following are the requirements for examination in each discipline: a. Worker: 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
i. 50 multiple-choice questions 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=71 g=1 f=1 -->
D. Continuing Education 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->
For all disciplines, a State's accreditation program shall include annual refresher training as a requirement for
reaccreditation as indicated below: 1. Workers: One full day of refresher training. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
2. Contractor/Supervisors: One full day of refresher training. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
3. Inspectors: One half-day of refresher training. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
4. Management Planners: One half-day of inspector refresher training and one half-day of refresher training for
management planners. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
5. Project Designers: One full day of refresher training. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The refresher courses shall be specific to each discipline. Refresher courses shall be conducted as separate and
distinct courses and not combined with any other training during the period of the refresher course. For each discipline,
the refresher course shall review and discuss changes in Federal, State, and local regulations, developments in
state-of-the-art procedures, and a review of key aspects of the initial training course as determined by the State.
After completing the annual refresher course, persons shall have their accreditation extended for an additional
year from the date of the refresher course. A State may consider requiring persons to pass reaccreditation examinations
at specific intervals (for example, every 3 years). 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
EPA recommends that States formally establish a 12-month grace period to enable formerly accredited persons with
expired certificates to complete refresher training and have their accreditation status reinstated without having
to re-take the initial training course. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=71 g=1 f=1 -->
E. Qualifications 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->
In addition to requiring training and an examination, a State may require candidates for accreditation to meet other
qualification and/or experience standards that the State considers appropriate for some or all disciplines. States
may choose to consider requiring qualifications similar to the examples outlined below for inspectors, management
planners and project designers. States may modify these examples as appropriate. In addition, States may want to
include some requirements based on experience in performing a task directly as a part of a job or in an apprenticeship
role. They may also wish to consider additional criteria for the approval of training course instructors beyond those
prescribed by EPA. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
1. Inspectors: Qualifications - possess a high school diploma. States may want to require an Associate's Degree in
specific fields (e.g., environmental or physical sciences). 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
2. Management Planners: Qualifications - Registered architect, engineer, or certified industrial hygienist or
related scientific field. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
3. Project Designers: Qualifications - registered architect, engineer, or certified industrial hygienist. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
4. Asbestos Training Course Instructor: Qualifications - academic credentials and/or field experience in asbestos
abatement. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
EPA recommends that States prescribe minimum qualification standards for training instructors employed by training
providers. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=71 g=1 f=1 -->
F. Recordkeeping Requirements for Training Providers 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->
All approved providers of accredited asbestos training courses must comply with the following minimum recordkeeping
requirements. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
1. Training course materials. A training provider must retain copies of all instructional materials used in the delivery
of the classroom training such as student manuals, instructor notebooks and handouts. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
2. Instructor qualifications. A training provider must retain copies of all instructors' resumes, and the documents
approving each instructor issued by either EPA or a State. Instructors must be approved by either EPA or a State before
teaching courses for accreditation purposes. A training provider must notify EPA or the State, as appropriate, in
advance whenever it changes course instructors. Records must accurately identify the instructors that taught each
particular course for each date that a course is offered. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
3. Examinations. A training provider must document that each person who receives an accreditation certificate for
an initial training course has achieved a passing score on the examination. These records must clearly indicate the
date upon which the exam was administered, the training course and discipline for which the exam was given, the name
of the person who proctored the exam, a copy of the exam, and the name and test score of each person taking the exam. The
topic and dates of the training course must correspond to those listed on that person's accreditation certificate.
States may choose to apply these same requirements to examinations for refresher training courses. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
4. Accreditation certificates. The training providers or States, whichever issues the accreditation certificate,
shall maintain records that document the names of all persons who have been awarded certificates, their certificate
numbers, the disciplines for which accreditation was conferred, training and expiration dates, and the training
location. The training provider or State shall maintain the records in a manner that allows verification by telephone
of the required information. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
5. Verification of certificate information. EPA recommends that training providers of refresher training courses
confirm that their students possess valid accreditation before granting course admission. EPA further recommends
that training providers offering the initial management planner training course verify that students have met the
prerequisite of possessing valid inspector accreditation at the time of course admission. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
6. Records retention and access. (a) The training provider shall maintain all required records for a minimum of 3 years.
The training provider, however, may find it advantageous to retain these records for a longer period of time. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(b) The training provider must allow reasonable access to all of the records required by the MAP, and to any other records
which may be required by States for the approval of asbestos training providers or the accreditation of asbestos training
courses, to both EPA and to State Agencies, on request. EPA encourages training providers to make this information
equally accessible to the general public. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(c) If a training provider ceases to conduct training, the training provider shall notify the approving government
body (EPA or the State) and give it the opportunity to take possession of that providers asbestos training records.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=71 g=1 f=1 -->
G. Deaccreditation 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->
1. States must establish criteria and procedures for deaccrediting persons accredited as workers, contractor/supervisors,
inspectors, management planners, and project designers. States must follow their own administrative procedures
in pursuing deaccreditation actions. At a minimum, the criteria shall include: (a) Performing work requiring accreditation
at a job site without being in physical possession of initial and current accreditation certificates; (b) Permitting
the duplication or use of one's own accreditation certificate by another; 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(c) Performing work for which accreditation has not been received; or (d) Obtaining accreditation from a training
provider that does not have approval to offer training for the particular discipline from either EPA or from a State
that has a contractor accreditation plan at least as stringent as the EPA MAP. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
EPA may directly pursue deaccreditation actions without reliance on State deaccreditation or enforcement authority
or actions. In addition to the above-listed situations, the Administrator may suspend or revoke the accreditation
of persons who have been subject to a final order imposing a civil penalty or convicted under section 16 of TSCA, 15 U.S.C.
2615 or 2647, for violations of 40 CFR part 763, or section 113 of the Clean Air Act, 42 U.S.C. 7413, for violations of
40 CFR part 61, subpart M. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
2. Any person who performs asbestos work requiring accreditation under section 206(a) of TSCA, 15 U.S.C. 2646(a),
without such accreditation is in violation of TSCA. The following persons are not accredited for purposes of section
206(a) of TSCA: 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(a) Any person who obtains accreditation through fraudulent representation of training or examination documents;

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(b) Any person who obtains training documentation through fraudulent means; 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(c) Any person who gains admission to and completes refresher training through fraudulent representation of initial
or previous refresher training documentation; or 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(d) Any person who obtains accreditation through fraudulent representation of accreditation requirements such
as education, training, professional registration, or experience. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=71 g=1 f=1 -->
H. Reciprocity 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->
EPA recommends that each State establish reciprocal arrangements with other States that have established accreditation
programs that meet or exceed the requirements of the MAP. Such arrangements might address cooperation in licensing
determinations, the review and approval of training programs and/or instructors, candidate testing and exam administration,
curriculum development, policy formulation, compliance monitoring, and the exchange of information and data.
The benefits to be derived from these arrangements include a potential cost-savings from the reduction of duplicative
activity and the attainment of a more professional accredited workforce as States are able to refine and improve the
effectiveness of their programs based upon the experience and methods of other States. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=73 g=1 f=1 -->
II. EPA Approval Process for State Accreditation Programs 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->
A. States may seek approval for a single discipline or all disciplines as specified in the MAP. For example, a State
that currently only requires worker accreditation may receive EPA approval for that discipline alone. EPA encourages
States that currently do not have accreditation requirements for all disciplines required under section 206(b)(2)
of TSCA, 15 U.S.C. 2646(b)(2), to seek EPA approval for those disciplines the State does accredit. As States establish
accreditation requirements for the remaining disciplines, the requested information outlined below should be
submitted to EPA as soon as possible. Any State that had an accreditation program approved by EPA under an earlier version
of the MAP may follow the same procedures to obtain EPA approval of their accreditation program under this MAP. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
B. Partial approval of a State Program for the accreditation of one or more disciplines does not mean that the State
is in full compliance with TSCA where the deadline for that State to have adopted a State Plan no less stringent than
the MAP has already passed. State Programs which are at least as stringent as the MAP for one or more of the accredited
disciplines may, however, accredit persons in those disciplines only. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
C. States seeking EPA approval or reapproval of accreditation programs shall submit the following information to
the Regional Asbestos Coordinator at their EPA Regional office: 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
1. A copy of the legislation establishing or upgrading the State's accreditation program (if applicable). 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
2. A copy of the State's accreditation regulations or revised regulations. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
3. A letter to the Regional Asbestos Coordinator that clearly indicates how the State meets the program requirements
of this MAP. Addresses for each of the Regional Asbestos Coordinators are shown below:

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->
Individuals or groups wishing to sponsor training courses for disciplines required to be accredited under section
206(b)(1)(A) of TSCA, 15 U.S.C. 2646(b)(1)(A), may apply for approval from States that have accreditation program
requirements that are at least as stringent as this MAP. For a course to receive approval, it must meet the requirements
for the course as outlined in this MAP, and any other requirements imposed by the State from which approval is being
sought. Courses that have been approved by a State with an accreditation program at least as stringent as this MAP are
approved under section 206(a) of TSCA, 15 U.S.C. 2646(a), for that particular State, and also for any other State that
does not have an accreditation program as stringent as this MAP.

C. Withdrawal of Training Course Approval 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->
States must establish criteria and procedures for suspending or withdrawing approval from accredited training
programs. States should follow their own administrative procedures in pursuing actions for suspension or withdrawal
of approval of training programs. At a minimum, the criteria shall include: 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(1) Misrepresentation of the extent of a training course's approval by a State or EPA; 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(2) Failure to submit required information or notifications in a timely manner; 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(3) Failure to maintain requisite records; 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(4) Falsification of accreditation records, instructor qualifications, or other accreditation information;
or 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(5) Failure to adhere to the training standards and requirements of the EPA MAP or State Accreditation Program, as
appropriate. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In addition to the criteria listed above, EPA may also suspend or withdraw a training course's approval where an approved
training course instructor, or other person with supervisory authority over the delivery of training has been found
in violation of other asbestos regulations administered by EPA. An administrative or judicial finding of violation,
or execution of a consent agreement and order under 40 CFR 22.18, constitutes evidence of a failure to comply with relevant
statutes or regulations. States may wish to adopt this criterion modified to include their own asbestos statutes
or regulations. EPA may also suspend or withdraw approval of training programs where a training provider has submitted
false information as a part of the self-certification required under Unit V.B. of the revised MAP. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Training course providers shall permit representatives of EPA or the State which approved their training courses
to attend, evaluate, and monitor any training course without charge. EPA or State compliance inspection staff are
not required to give advance notice of their inspections. EPA may suspend or withdraw State or EPA approval of a training
course based upon the criteria specified in this Unit III.C.

that satisfies the requirements of this MAP until the State adopts an accreditation plan that is at least as stringent
as this MAP. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
4. A State that had complied with an earlier version of the MAP, but fails to adopt a plan as stringent as this MAP by the
deadline established in Unit V.A.1., is subject to the following after that deadline date: 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
a. The State loses any status it may have held as an EPA-approved State for accreditation purposes under section 206
of TSCA, 15 U.S.C. 2646.

B. Requirements applicable to Training Courses and Providers
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->
As of October 4, 1994, an approved training provider must certify to EPA and to any State that has approved the provider
for TSCA accreditation, that each of the provider's training courses complies with the requirements of this MAP.
The written submission must document in specific detail the changes made to each training course in order to comply
with the requirements of this MAP and clearly state that the provider is also in compliance with all other requirements
of this MAP, including the new recordkeeping and certificate provisions. Each submission must include the following
statement signed by an authorized representative of the training provider: ``Under civil and criminal penalties
of law for the making or submission of false or fraudulent statements or representations (18 U.S.C. 1001 and 15 U.S.C.
2615), I certify that the training described in this submission complies with all applicable requirements of Title
II of TSCA, 40 CFR part 763, Appendix C to Subpart E, as revised, and any other applicable Federal, state, or local requirements.''
A consolidated self-certification submission from each training provider that addresses all of its approved training
courses is permissible and encouraged. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The self-certification must be sent via registered mail, to EPA Headquarters at the following address: Attn. Self-Certification
Program, Field Programs Branch, Chemical Management Division (7404), Office of Pollution Prevention and Toxics,
Environmental Protection Agency, 401 M St., SW., Washington, DC 20460. A duplicate copy of the complete submission
must also be sent to any States from which approval had been obtained. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The timely receipt of a complete self-certification by EPA and all approving States shall have the effect of extending
approval under this MAP to the training courses offered by the submitting provider. If a self-certification is not
received by the approving government bodies on or before the due date, the affected training course is not approved
under this MAP. Such training providers must then reapply for approval of these training courses pursuant to the procedures
outlined in Unit III.
