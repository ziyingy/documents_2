As part of maintenance, there should be a predictive element which periodically checks the HVAC system to evaluate
conformance with paragraph (d). This check should conform with the proposals of paragraph (d)(2) which requires
an inspection and maintenance of the building systems. This periodic visual inspection is focused by the checklist
outlined in paragraph (c) and targets those components that directly impact indoor air quality. In the field of occupational
safety and health, as practiced by industrial hygienists, it is common practice to perform walk-around inspections.
On the other hand, the HVAC industry often relies heavily on remote sensing to characterize system performance. Therefore,
this required visual inspection will help identify those deficiencies that would otherwise be missed, such as microbial
contamination in cooling coil condensate drip pans.

Paragraph (d)(3) requires that the facility HVAC system is operating during all workshifts. The employer must provide
the minimum outside ventilation rate for contaminant dilution and removal whenever the building is occupied and
used. OSHA understands that the minimum outside air ventilation rate may in practice only be provided when the building
is fully occupied or utilized. It is not uncommon for office buildings to be occupied from 6 a.m. to 7 p.m. to accommodate
flexible work schedules but the HVAC system may only be in operation from 8 a.m. to 5 p.m. to conserve energy. The technical
rationale for this strategy is typically based on the recommendations of the American Society of Heating, Refrigerating
and Air-Conditioning Engineers, Inc. (ASHRAE) in their Standard 62&hyph;1989 titled ``Ventilation for Acceptable
Indoor Air Quality''. Section 6.1.3.4 and Appendix ``G'' of ASHRAE Standard 62&hyph;1989 [Ex. 4&hyph;333] offers
a rationale for the lead/lag operation of ventilation systems to accommodate transient occupancy. The basis for
the rationale is that there is capacity in air to dilute contaminants if the space has been previously unoccupied for
several hours. This strategy, however, applies only to occupant generated contaminants like carbon dioxide and
odors. Housekeeping cleaning agents or pesticides are typical of contaminants that may be released which could not
be absorbed by a non-ventilated space. Consequently, other contaminants must be diluted/removed by the ventilation
system whenever the building is occupied. In addition, it is recognized that certain automatic temperature control
strategies can also prevent a facility from receiving the minimum outside air ventilation rate. The obvious example
is the early morning warm-up cycle wherein the outside air dampers are kept shut in the morning until the space temperature
recovers from the setback temperature of the night before. These energy conservation and temperature control strategies
must not interfere with providing minimum outside air ventilation when the building is occupied. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Paragraph (d)(4) proposes to require the employer to utilize general or local exhaust ventilation, as provided by
the existing HVAC system or auxiliary systems, to minimize the hazards associated with maintenance or housekeeping
activities. The literature reports IAQ/BRI episodes that were initiated with activities like painting, carpet
cleaning and floor resurfacing. If these activities occur during unoccupied periods then chemical vapors from paints
and adhesives and excessive moisture from carpet cleaning may be diluted and removed by the outside air ventilation
function of the HVAC system. During occupied periods, efforts should be made to restrict transportation of hazardous
contaminants from these activities throughout the facility by the HVAC air distribution system. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Paragraph (d)(5) proposes to require the employer to maintain occupied space relative humidities below 60% in buildings
with mechanical cooling systems. Moisture in a building may support and amplify microbial contamination with potential
for aerosolization. Both the American Society of Heating, Refrigerating and Air-Conditioning Engineers, Inc.
(ASHRAE) in their Standard 62&hyph;1989 titled ``Ventilation for Acceptable Indoor Air Quality'', section 5.11
[Ex. 4&hyph;333] and the American Conference of Governmental Industrial Hygienists (ACGIH) in their 1989 ``Guidelines
for the Assessment of Bioaerosols in the Indoor Environment'' [Ex. 3&hyph;61] recommend that relative humidity
in the occupied space be maintained below 60%. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
OSHA is inviting comments on whether a relative humidity of 60% is the appropriate upper limit to inhibit microbial
growth or if a higher limit is appropriate. In addition, OSHA would like comment on whether there should be a lower level
of relative humidity as recommended by ASHRAE and ACGIH to reduce irritation effects due to low relative humidity.
And finally, OSHA would like additional comment on whether it is feasible in hot and humid climates to achieve relative
humidities of 60% or less.

Paragraph (d)(6) proposes to require the employer to monitor for carbon dioxide (CO

) in the occupied space as part of maintenance or employee complaint investigations. When the concentration exceeds
800 ppm, the employer would be required to check the operation of the HVAC system. CO

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 by respiring occupants in the space, it would be possible to predict the rate of removal of CO

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->

like CO

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

, water vapor, and odors (human bioeffluents). However, the CO

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 concentration and the associated outside air ventilation rate offers no confidence as to the adequacy of dilution
and removal of other contaminants released in the space. If the outside air ventilation rate is insufficient to dilute
and remove CO

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=2 -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
, then it can be assumed that other contaminant concentrations will also be elevated. The literature reports that
CO

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 concentrations in the space under 800 ppm will minimize health-related complaints [Exs. 3&hyph;34A, 4&hyph;331].
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Paragraph (d)(8) proposes to require the employer to restrict the presence of hazardous substances in air distribution
systems. The HVAC air distribution system itself should not be the source of hazardous contaminants due to its' critical
nature as a potential pathway to building occupants. Enclosed ducts are typically not used to store hazardous substances
but non-ducted air transport pathways such as area-ways, plenums, chases, corridors, and mechanical rooms serving
as return air plenums are sometimes used for storage. If these air transport pathways are used for storage, then the
employer must be especially careful to make sure that no spillage or leakage of hazardous substances occurs. This
will insure that the pathways are kept free of hazardous substances.
