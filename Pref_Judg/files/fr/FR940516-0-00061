Licenses are likely to be approved, as administrative exceptions, for exports to Albania, Armenia, Azerbaijan,
Bulgaria, Belarus, Estonia, Georgia, Kazakhstan, Kyrgyzstan, Latvia, Lithuania, Moldova, Mongolia, the People's
Republic of China, Romania, Russia, Tajikistan, Turkmenistan, Ukraine, Uzbekistan, and Vietnam of telecommunications
equipment or systems controlled by 5A02.a through 5A02.g, 5A03, 5A04 or 5A05, measuring, test or repair equipment
controlled by 5B01.c or 5B02, and specially designed components and accessories, ``software'' and technology necessary
for the ``use'' thereof, provided that: 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG QTAG 02 -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->
a. Optical fiber telecommunication transmission equipment or systems: 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
1. Are designed to operate at a ``digital transfer rate'' of 623 Mbit/s or less at the highest multiplex level; 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=3 -->
and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
2. Are designed to operate on a ``laser'' transmission wavelength not exceeding 1,590 nm. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
b. Digital radio equipment or systems: 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
1. Are designed to operate at a ``digital transfer rate'' of 623 Mbit/s or less at the highest multiplex level; 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
2. Do not employ QAM techniques exceeding level 512 or other digital modulation techniques having a ``spectral efficiency''
exceeding 9 bit/s/Hz; 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
c. ``CCS'': 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
1. Is limited to the associated mode of operation; 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
2. Signalling and related speech/data channels are limited to two signalling points and must not be routed via different
transmission media or different routes;
