The Department will prepare transcripts of the oral comments received during the scoping workshops. The records
of all comments, both oral and written, received during the scoping period will be made available for public review
in the reading rooms listed above. Additional background documents and references identified as pertinent during
the EIS process will also be made available in the reading rooms.

The following is a list of forthcoming NEPA documentation related to this EIS that have the potential for affecting
its scope by inclusion of the Nevada Test Site as an alternative site for the action being considered: 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(a) Reconfiguration Programmatic EIS_On July 23, 1993, the Department published a revised Notice of Intent (56 FR
39528) to prepare a Programmatic EIS for reconfiguration of its nuclear weapons complex due to nuclear weapons stockpile
reductions. The Department currently is considering how the scope of this Programmatic EIS should be revised further
to reflect more recent budget and stockpile reduction decisions. The Nevada Test Site is a potential alternative
site in this EIS. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(b) The Fissile Materials Storage and Disposition Programmatic EIS will address the long-term storage of all fissile
nuclear materials and disposition of surplus fissile nuclear materials. The Notice of Intent announcing the preparation
of this EIS was published in the 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 -->
Federal Register
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 (59 FR 31985), on June 21, 1994. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(c) The Environmental Restoration and Waste Management Programmatic EIS will address waste management alternatives
for existing and proposed actions and DOE complex-wide issues associated with long-term waste management policies
and practices. In this Programmatic EIS, the Department is evaluating the Nevada Test Site as an alternative site
for managing DOE wastes. An Implementation Plan for this Programmatic EIS was issued in January 1994. The final Programmatic
EIS is scheduled to be issued in 1995. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(d) The Spent Nuclear Fuel Management and Idaho National Engineering Laboratory Environmental Restoration and
Waste Management Programs EIS analyzes the potential environmental consequences of alternatives to the transportation,
receipt, processing, and storage of the Department's spent nuclear fuel. The Nevada Test Site is being evaluated
as a potential spent nuclear fuel management site in this analysis, but the Department has stated that the Nevada Test
Site is not the preferred alternative; 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(e) The Proposed Policy for the Acceptance of United States Origin Foreign Research Reactor Spent Nuclear Fuel EIS
will address the potential environmental impacts of the proposed policy renewal and its implementation. Under a
renewed policy, the United States could accept up to 15,000 foreign research reactor spent fuel elements over a 10
to 15 year period. The Nevada Test Site is a potential storage site in this EIS. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(f) The Continued Operation of the Pantex Plant and Associated Storage of Nuclear Weapons Components EIS will address
the potential environmental impacts of the continued operation of the Pantex Plant. These include near- to mid-term
foreseeable activities and the nuclear component storage activities at other Department sites associated with
nuclear weapon disassembly at the Pantex Plant, over the next 5 to 10 years. The Nevada Test Site is being considered
as a potential site under the relocation of operations alternative. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(g) The environmental restoration program at the Fernald Environmental Management project is divided into five
operable units. For each operable unit, a feasibility study/proposed plan is being prepared to provide a detailed
evaluation of the leading remedial alternative for each area of contamination. Nevada Test Site may be identified
as the preferred candidate disposal site for portions of the low level waste generated during cleanup activities
for each operable unit. The current schedule for the Department to submit the feasibility study/proposed plans to
the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency for approval is as follows: Operable Unit 1 (Waste Pits), submitted July
1994; Operable Unit 2 (Solid Waste Units), to be submitted August 1994; Operable Unit 3 (Production Area), to be submitted
November 1996; Operable Unit 4 (Silos), submitted December 1993; and Operable Unit 5 (Environmental Media), to be
submitted in February 1995.

The preparation of this Site-wide EIS will require the participation of several Federal agencies, some of which may
be identified as cooperating agencies under the NEPA process. These include the Air Force, Department of the Interior
(Bureau of Land Management and Fish and Wildlife Service), and the Defense Nuclear Agency.
