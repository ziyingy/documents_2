Any State, unit of local government, combination of units of local government, public or private agency, organization,
institution, or other non-profit entity is eligible to apply for these funds. Federally recognized Indian Tribes
are eligible to apply for Basic Center grants. Non-Federally recognized Indian Tribes and urban Indian organizations

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Grantees (including subgrantees) with current Basic Center grants who are eligible to apply for continuation funding
in FY 1994 may not apply for a new Basic Center grant under this announcement. Applicants may refer to Part VI, Appendix
D.1 for a listing of current grantees which are ineligible for grants under this priority area.

As required by runaway and homeless youth legislation, priority for funding will be given to agencies with demonstrated
experience establishing and operating centers that provide direct services to runaway and homeless youth in a manner
that is outside the law enforcement system, the child welfare system, the mental health system and the juvenile justice
system. Demonstrated experience providing direct services means three (3) or more years of continuous effort serving
runaway and homeless youth in one or more areas set forth in section 312 of the Act. Applications claiming credit for
this preference must include a statement of no more than one page documenting the relevant experience.
