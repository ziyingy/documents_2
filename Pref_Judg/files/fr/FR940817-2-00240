In older adults the normal aging process alters the response to neurotoxicants. Both 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
pharmacodynamic and pharmacokinetic changes may underlie altered sensitivities to the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
neurotoxic effects of drugs and chemicals. An example well known in geriatric medicine is 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the apparent increase in sensitivity of the elderly to the toxic effects of anxiolytics (Salzman, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
1981). Decreases in biotransformation rate and renal elimination of parent drug and active 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
metabolites, not related to disease processes, may partially account for the increased 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
vulnerability (Friedel, 1978). Chronic disease states in older persons may result in decreased 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
functional capabilities and increased vulnerability to neurotoxic effects. Chronic diseases 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
also may prompt pharmacotherapy that may impair neurobehavioral function. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Cardiovascular, psychopharmacologic, and antineoplastic medications may result in patterns 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
of neurobehavioral impairment not typically seen in younger individuals.

3.5.2. Methodologic Considerations 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Standardized methods are being developed for pediatric neurotoxicity assessment. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Neurobehavioral functions emerge during developmental phases from neonatal stage through 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
secondary school, and nervous system insult may be reflected not only in impairment of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
emergent functions, but also as delays in the appearance of new functions. Both the severity 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
and type of deficit are affected by the dose and duration of exposure (Nelson, 1991b), and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
different sensitivities to chemical effects may be exhibited at different stages of nervous 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
system development. Early episodes of exposure may produce structural damage to the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
nervous system that may not be developmentally expressed in behavior for several months or 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
years. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The selection of appropriate testing methods and conditions is more important when 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
assessing children because of shorter attention spans and increased dependence on parental 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
and environmental supports. In addition, because of the increasing complexity of functional 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
capabilities during early development, only a few tests appropriate for infants can be validly 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
readministered to older children. Given the complexity of these variables, the task of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
devising sensitive, reliable, and valid assessment instruments or batteries for pediatric 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
populations will be challenging. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Assessment methods in older adults must be capable of distinguishing chemical and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
drug effects from the effects of aging processes and chronic disease states (Crook et al., 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
1983). Assessment methods must be valid and reliable with repeated administration across a 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
significant portion of the lifespan, and take into consideration the time (days, months, or 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
years) that may intervene between exposure/insult and the expression of neurotoxicity as 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
functional impairment. Research on nonexposed populations to develop age-appropriate 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
normative scores for neurobehavioral functions will be important for the interpretation of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
assessment instruments. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Environmental exposure to neurotoxic chemicals and drugs is correlated with 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
socioeconomic and ethnic status. Assessment methods will therefore have to be adapted to 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
diverse ethnic, cultural, and language groups. While gender differences in early 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
development have been noted, differential responses of males and females to neurotoxicants 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
have been less well explored and should receive attention.

3.6.1. Risk Assessment Criteria for Neurobehavioral Test Methods 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The value of human neurobehavioral test methods for quantitative risk assessment is 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
related to the number of the following criteria that can be met: 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
a. Demonstrate sensitivity to the kinds of neurobehavioral impairment produced by 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
chemicals; that is, able to detect a difference between exposed and nonexposed populations in 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
field studies or between exposure and nonexposure periods in human laboratory research or 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
within exposed populations over time. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
b. Show specificity for neurotoxic chemical effects and not be unduly responsive to a 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
host of other nonchemical factors, and show specificity for the neurobehavioral function 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
believed to be measured by the test method. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
c. Demonstrate adequate reliability (consistency of measurement over time) and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
validity (concordance with other behavioral, physiologic, biochemical, or anatomic measures 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
of neurotoxicity). 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
d. Show graded amounts of neurobehavioral change as a function of exposure 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
parameter, absorbed dose, or body burden along some ordinal or continuous metric (dose 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
response). 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
e. For representative classes or subclasses of CNS/PNS-active chemicals, identify 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
single effects or patterns of impairment across several tests or functional domains that are 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
reasonably consistent from study to study (structure-activity). 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
f. Be amenable to the development of a procedurally similar counterpart that can be 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
used to assess homologous behaviors in animals.
