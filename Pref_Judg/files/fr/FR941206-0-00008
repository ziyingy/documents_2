FSIS proposed to permit an alternative measurement to the protein digestibility-corrected amino acid score method,
which requires a digestibility measurement in addition to an amino acid analysis, to control the cost of monitoring
compliance with the protein quality requirement. FSIS proposed that, for the purpose of measuring the protein quality
of meat derived from advanced meat/bone separation machinery and recovery systems, an alternative measurement
of protein quality would be allowed that is comparable to the protein digestibility-corrected amino acid score.
This measure would be based on a comparison between the ``essential amino acid content of meat'' and ``total amino
acids present in meat,'' i.e., an essential amino acid content of at least 33 percent of the total amino acids present
in the meat. Essential amino acid content includes isoleucine, leucine, lysine, methionine, phenylalanine, threonine,
and valine content, and the total amino acids present include isoleucine, leucine, lysine, methionine, phenylalanine,
threonine, valine, tyrosine, arginine, histidine, alanine, aspartic acid, glutamic acid, glycine, proline, serine,
and hydroxyproline content. The proposed rule required essential amino acid content to be determined by methods
given in sections 5.4.1, 7.2.1, and 8.00 in the ``Protein Quality Evaluation, Report of the Joint FAO/WHO Expert Consultation
on Protein Quality Evaluation'' which was incorporated by reference in the proposed rule.

Quality control.

FSIS proposed to require that meat derived from advanced meat/bone separation machinery and recovery systems be
produced under an approved quality control program. The function of a quality control program would be to restrict
potential deviations from the prescribed definition of meat by controlling the factors that can affect conformance
with the definition. Thus, FSIS proposed to require that the quality control program provide the controls and information
necessary to assure that the meat from advanced meat/bone separation and recovery systems will meet each of the requirements
of the regulations and will enable establishment personnel and FSIS to monitor it for effectiveness. FSIS focused
on methods that would maintain the uniformity of starting materials, and control the handling and processing of starting
materials and resulting product. It was proposed that the methods of analysis for calcium and protein quality that
were permitted and that were intended to be used should be identified in the quality control system.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Under the proposal, the owner or operator of an establishment that intends to manufacture meat from advanced meat/bone
separation machinery and recovery systems would request the Administrator of FSIS to approve the establishment's
quality control program. The procedures and criteria for receiving such requests and assessing the adequacy of programs
for quality control, as well as for terminating approval, would be those set forth in 9 CFR 318.4.

To ensure that product satisfies the calcium requirement, FSIS proposed that a sample of at least 1 pound from each
lot of production would be taken and analyzed for calcium. A lot would consist of the meat derived from advanced meat/bone
separation machinery and recovery systems, designated as such by the operator of the establishment or his or her agent,
from the product produced from a single species of livestock in no more than one continuous shift of up to 12 hours. The
results from chemical analyses would be compared to the requirement of 150 mg/100 gm of product within a tolerance
of 0.03 percent or 30 mg. If statistical evidence exists that product may not be in compliance, then further sampling
of the product was required to demonstrate that the product is in compliance with requirements for meat derived from
meat/bone separation and recovery systems.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
FSIS proposed that statistical evidence of non-compliance exists when an individual analytical result is more than
0.03 percent (i.e., 30 mg) above the requirement, i.e., greater than 0.18 percent (i.e., 180 mg). (This tolerance
is derived by equating it to three times the expected standard deviation (i.e., 0.1 percent) of the analytical procedure
used by FSIS to measure the calcium contents in samples.)

If any single analytical result is more than 0.18 percent, FSIS proposed that, before product from a production lot
that is still at the establishment or one subsequently produced can be considered to be in compliance, at least three
samples

 from that lot must be taken and analyzed for calcium, either separately or as a composite (i.e., combining the three
samples for analysis), at the option of the establishment. The average of the results or the composite result must
comply with the requirement for calcium (i.e., less than or equal to 0.15 percent). Taking three samples from each
subsequently produced lot would continue until five consecutive lots

 have mean or composite results less than or equal to 0.15 percent. Individual results or an average of results would
be rounded to the nearest 0.01 percent based on the precision of the methodology for measuring calcium. If the FSIS
program official detects any results out of compliance, the program official may undertake normal compliance procedures.

The provision for sampling five consecutive production lots is based on statistical sampling principles that ensure
that the process is in control and that mean or composite calcium results are less than or equal to the calcium requirement.
