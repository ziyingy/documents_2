(f) Law Enforcement Concerns and Justification are Speculative and Misleading 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Several commenters expressed their belief that the Service's concerns related to law enforcement problems were
unfounded or exaggerated and that the regulations would mislead or confuse hunters who are trying to comply with State
regulations. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Service's law enforcement concerns and justifications are based on professional opinions and extensive experiences
of Service law enforcement agents in Alaska. Testimony provided by defendants during cases involving prosecution
for violations of the Airborne Hunting Act corroborate the Service's law enforcement concerns. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In addition, the Service's law enforcement concerns and justifications for the proposed rule were reinforced by
comments received from some Alaskan residents who have personally witnessed or observed that same-day-airborne
take commonly entails abusive and illegal practices of chasing, herding and harassing wolves with airplanes. Some
wolf hunters and aircraft owners/operators indicated that it is all but impossible or rare to take wolves same-day-airborne
without violating the Airborne Hunting Act. Some commenters made the point that the only effective means to take wolves
same-day-airborne is to drive a wolf to exhaustion and/or to a place where a hunter can safely land and shoot it.

(g) Ethics and Fair Chase for Hunting Do Not Apply to Trapping 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Some commenters stated same-day-airborne taking of wolves is done under a State trapping license and, therefore,
the practice does not conflict with Service policy in the Refuge Manual or other fair chase principles and ethics associated
with sport hunting. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Based on the overwhelming majority of comments received, this belief is not shared by the large majority of the public,
including most other sportsmen. The Service does not believe that it should ignore ethical and fair chase considerations
that strongly affect public perceptions of hunting and trapping on refuges. To disregard or fail to consider and respond
to ethical considerations of fair chase and other perceptions and views shared by the majority of the general public
may ultimately jeopardize the future of hunting and trapping opportunities on national wildlife refuges. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Alaska regulations allow trappers to shoot wolves and other furbearers with firearms or any other legal weapon as
a lawful method of trapping. Thus, a person can shoot wolves with a trapping license as well as with a hunting license.
The Service disagrees with the argument that possession of a trapping license exempts a person from all ethical obligations
and standards of fair chase, particularly when anyone can purchase a trapping license to shoot wolves.

(h) Inconsistent With Federal Government's Legal Obligation to Accommodate Subsistence Uses 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Several commenters expressed views that the regulations would limit subsistence activities or reduce traditional
trapping opportunities and are not in compliance with Section 811 of ANILCA requiring that subsistence users have
reasonable access to subsistence resources. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The regulations apply to general or sport harvest of wolves and wolverines. Federal subsistence regulations already
prohibit same-day-airborne take of wolves and wolverines for 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
subsistence purposes. Access is not restricted, as already discussed. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Service received contradictory comments and views from Alaskan residents on the need and legitimacy of same-day-airborne
shooting of wolves as customary and traditional subsistence activity. The State and some Alaskan residents, including
some rural Alaskans, contend that same-day-airborne or land and shoot take of wolves is a traditional and legitimate
subsistence activity that should be allowed to continue on Alaska refuges. Other Alaskan residents contend it is
not a legitimate subsistence activity, but rather a sport or recreational activity for urban hunters and trappers.
