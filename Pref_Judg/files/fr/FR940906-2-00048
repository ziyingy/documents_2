The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) announces the availability of funds for fiscal year (FY) 1994
for a sole source grant with the Institute of Medicine (IOM), National Academy of Sciences (NAS). The purpose of this
program is to consolidate assistance mechanisms used to support the current research activities conducted by IOM,
integrate newly initiated assistance activities that are of special interest to CDC, and establish a systematic
procedure for managing the unique scientific relationship between CDC and IOM. During FY 1993, CDC initiated three
distinct funding mechanisms to support IOM research in the areas of unintended pregnancy, tobacco prevention strategies
for youth, and comprehensive school health programs. This grant program would provide for a more uniform management
of the various research activities to be funded in the future.

Approximately $365,000 is available in FY 1994 to fund three projects of special interest to CDC:

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Project 1. Comprehensive School Health_Approximately $125,000 is available for the continuation of activities
to assess the status of existing comprehensive school health programs including K&hyph;12 school health education,
school health promotion and disease prevention, and school based health care delivery, examine factors predictive
of success or failure, and identify and disseminate strategies for wider implementation of comprehensive school
health programs.

Project 2. Epidemiological Dimensions of Sexually Transmitted Diseases (STDs) in the United States_Approximately
$225,000 is available to support a new study designed to examine the epidemiological dimensions of STDs in the United
States and the factors contributing to the rising incidence of infections, assess the effectiveness (including
cost-effectiveness) and efficiency of current public health strategies and programs to prevent and control STDs,
and develop recommendations for future public health programs, policy development, and research in this area, particularly
in the context of health care reform and the trend towards managed care approaches to health services delivery and
financing.

Project 3. Study on Preventing Nicotine Addiction in Children and Youths_Approximately $15,000 is available to
continue and enhance activities related to Native American youth in an existing study of prevention strategies for
children and adolescents relative to tobacco consumption. This study will summarize studies on the biology of addiction,
social and behavioral factors involved in initiation, and interventions to prevent dependence and enhance cessation.

It is expected that the award will begin on or about September 30, 1994, for a 12-month budget period within a project
period of up to 5 years. Funding estimates may vary and are subject to change. Continuation awards within the project
period will be made on the basis of satisfactory progress and availability of funds. CDC anticipates the availability
of additional funds during FY 1995 and subsequent years to support projects of special scientific, programmatic,
and/or administrative importance to the mission of CDC. The availability of funds and the focus of such projects are
expected to emphasize activities in smoking, nutrition, diabetes, chronic disease control, reproductive health,
surveillance and analysis, cancer, and STDs but may include other disease prevention and control areas of special
interest to CDC. The availability of funds in subsequent years will be announced in a Program Guidance document accompanying
the application kit for each year of the project period. Projects proposed in response to annual Program Guidance
documents will be subjected to an Objective Review based on the Evaluation Criteria contained in this Program Announcement.
