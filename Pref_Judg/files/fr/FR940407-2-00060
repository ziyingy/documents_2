SUMMARY:
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
 Section 4005(c)(1)(B) of the Resource Conservation and Recovery Act (RCRA), as amended by the Hazardous and Solid
Waste Amendments (HSWA) of 1984, requires States to develop and implement permit programs to ensure that municipal
solid waste landfills (MSWLFs) which may receive hazardous household waste or conditionally exempt small quantity
generator waste will comply with the revised Federal MSWLF Criteria (40 CFR part 258). RCRA section 4005(c)(1)(C)
requires the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) to determine whether States have adequate ``permit'' programs
for MSWLFs. EPA believes that adequate authority exists under RCRA to allow Tribes to seek an adequacy determination
for purposes of sections 4005 and 4010.

Cheyenne River Sioux Tribe applied for a determination of adequacy under section 4005 of RCRA. EPA reviewed Cheyenne
River Sioux Tribe's MSWLF application and made a tentative determination that all portions of Cheyenne River Sioux
Tribe's MSWLF permit program are adequate to ensure compliance with the revised MSWLF Criteria. Cheyenne River Sioux
Tribe's application for program adequacy determination is available for public review and comment. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Although RCRA does not require EPA to hold a public hearing on a determination to approve any Tribe's MSWLF program,
the Region has tentatively scheduled a public hearing on this determination. If sufficient people express interest
in participating in a hearing by writing the Region or calling the contact given below within 30 days of the date of publication
of this notice, the Region will hold a hearing on the date given below in the

addition, anyone who wishes to learn whether the hearing will be held may call the person listed in the

 All comments on Cheyenne River Sioux Tribe's application for a determination of adequacy must be received by June
1, 1994. The public hearing is tentatively scheduled for 7 p.m. to 9 p.m., June 1, 1994, at the Elderly Nutrition Center,
Eagle Butte, South Dakota, 57625. Should a hearing be held, EPA may limit oral testimony to five minutes per speaker,
depending on the number of commenters. Commenters presenting oral testimony must also submit their comments in writing
at the hearing on June 1, 1994. The hearing may adjourn earlier than 9 p.m. if all of the speakers deliver their comments
before that hour. Representatives of the Cheyenne River Sioux Tribe will participate in the public hearing held by
EPA on this subject.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
On October 9, 1991, EPA promulgated revised Criteria for MSWLFs (40 CFR part 258). Subtitle D of RCRA, as amended by
the Hazardous and Solid Waste Amendments of 1984 (HSWA), requires States (and, as discussed below, allows Indian
Tribes,) to develop permitting programs to ensure that MSWLFs comply with the Federal Criteria under part 258. Subtitle
D also requires in section 4005 that EPA determine the adequacy of State municipal solid waste landfill permit programs
to ensure that facilities comply with the revised Federal Criteria. To fulfill this requirement, EPA has drafted
and is in the process of proposing a State/Tribal Implementation Rule (STIR) that will provide procedures by which
EPA will approve, or partially approve, State/Tribal landfill permit programs. The Agency intends to approve adequate
State/Tribal MSWLF permit programs as applications are submitted. Thus, these approvals are not dependent on final
promulgation of the STIR. Prior to promulgation of the STIR, adequacy determinations will be made based on the statutory
authorities and requirements. In addition, States/Tribes may use the draft STIR as an aid in interpreting these requirements.
EPA notes that regardless of the approval status of a State/Tribe and the permit status of any facility, the Federal
landfill Criteria will apply to all permitted and unpermitted MSWLFs. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

EPA is extending to Tribes the same opportunity to apply for permit program approval as is available to States. Providing
Tribes with the opportunity to apply for adequacy for purposes of adopting and implementing MSWLF permit programs
is consistent with EPA's Indian Policy. This Policy, formally adopted in 1984, recognizes Tribes as the primary sovereign
entities for regulating the reservation environment and commits the Agency to working with Tribes on a ``government-to-government''
basis to effectuate that recognition. A major goal of EPA's Indian Policy is to eliminate all statutory and regulatory
barriers to Tribal assumption of Federal environmental programs. Today's tentative determination to approve a
tribal MSWLF permit program represents another facet of the Agency's continuing commitment to the implementation
of this long-standing policy.

 467 U.S. 837 (1984). Where Congress has not explicitly stated its intent in adopting a statutory provision, the Agency
charged with implementing that statute may adopt any interpretation which, in the Agency's expert judgment, is reasonable
in light of the goals and purposes of the statute as a whole. Id. at 844. Interpreting RCRA to allow Tribes to apply for
an adequacy determination satisfies the
