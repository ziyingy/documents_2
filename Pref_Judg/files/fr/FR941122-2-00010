SUMMARY: 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
Subsection (e)(12) of the Privacy Act of 1974, as amended, (5 U.S.C. 552a) requires agencies to publish advance notice
of any proposed or revised computer matching program by the matching agency for public comment. The DoD, as the matching
agency under the Privacy Act is hereby giving constructive notice in lieu of direct notice to the record subjects of
a computer matching program between DOE and DoD that their records are being matched by computer. The record subjects
are DOE delinquent debtors who may be current or former Federal employees receiving Federal salary or benefit payments
and who are delinquent in their repayment of debts owed to the United States Government under programs administered
by DOE so as to permit DOE to pursue and collect the debt by voluntary repayment or by administrative or salary offset
procedures under the provisions of the Debt Collection Act of 1982.

SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
Pursuant to subsection (o) of the Privacy Act of 1974, as amended, (5 U.S.C. 552a), the DMDC and DOE have concluded an
agreement to conduct a computer matching program between the agencies. The purpose of the match is to exchange personal
data between the agencies for debt collection. The match will yield the identity and location of the debtors within
the Federal government so that DOE can pursue recoupment of the debt by voluntary payment or by administrative or salary
offset procedures. Computer matching appeared to be the most efficient and effective manner to accomplish this task
with the least amount of intrusion of personal privacy of the individuals concerned. It was therefore concluded and
agreed upon that computer matching would be the best and least obtrusive manner and choice for accomplishing this
requirement.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
A copy of the computer matching agreement between DOE and DMDC is available upon request to the public. Requests should
be submitted to the address caption above or to the Department of Energy, Office of Financial Policy, 1000 Independence
Agency, SW, Washington, DC 20585. Telephone (202) 856&hyph;4860.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The matching agreement, as required by 5 U.S.C. 552a(r) of the Privacy Act, and an advance copy of this notice was submitted
on November 9, 1994, to the Committee on Government Operations of the House of Representatives, the Committee on Governmental
Affairs of the Senate, and the Administrator of the Office of Information and Regulatory Affairs, Office of Management
and Budget pursuant to paragraph 4d of Appendix I to OMB Circular No. A&hyph;130, `Federal Agency Responsibilities
for Maintaining Records about Individuals,' dated July 15, 1994 (59 FR 37906, July 25, 1994). The matching program
is subject to review by OMB and Congress and shall not become effective until that review period has elapsed.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Participants in this computer matching program are the Department of Energy (DOE) and the Defense Manpower Data Center
(DMDC) of the Department of Defense (DoD). The DOE is the source agency, i.e., the activity disclosing the records
for the purpose of the match. The DMDC is the specific recipient activity or matching agency, i.e., the agency that
actually performs the computer matching.

Purpose of the match: 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Upon the execution of an agreement, the DOE will provide and disclose debtor records to DMDC to identify and locate
any matched Federal personnel, employed or retired, who may owe delinquent debts to the Federal Government under
certain programs administered by the DOD. The DOE will use this information to initiate independent collection of
those debts under the provisions of the Debt Collection Act of 1982 when voluntary payment is not forthcoming. These
collection efforts will include requests by the DOE of any employing Federal agency to apply administrative and/or
salary offset procedures until such time as the obligation is paid in full.

Sections 5 and 10 of the Debt Collection Act authorize agencies to disclose information about debtors in order to effect
salary or administrative offsets. Agencies must publish routine uses pursuant to subsection (b)(3) of the Privacy
Act for those systems of records from which they intend to disclose this information. Sections 5 and 10 of the Debt Collection
Act will comprise the necessary authority to meet the Privacy Act's `compatibility' condition. The systems of records
described above contain an appropriate routine use disclosure between the agencies of the information proposed

Description of computer matching program: 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The DOE, as the source agency, will provide DMDC with a diskette which contains the names of delinquent debtors in programs
the DOE administers. Upon receipt of the diskette file of debtor accounts, DMDC will perform a computer match using
all nine digits of the SSN of the DOE file against a DMDC computer database. The DMDC database, established under an
interagency agreement between DOD, OPM, OMB, and the Department of the Treasury, consists of employment records
of Federal employees and military members, active, and retired. Matching records (`hits'), based on the SSN, will
produce the member's name, service or agency, category of employee, and current work or home address. The hits or matches
will be furnished to the DOE. The DOE is responsible for verifying and determining that the data on the DMDC reply diskette
file are consistent with the DOE source file and for resolving any discrepancies or inconsistencies on an individual
basis. The DOE will also be responsible for making final determinations as to positive identification, amount of
indebtedness and recovery efforts as a result of the match.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The diskette provided by DOE will contain data elements of the debtor's name, Social Security Number, debtor status
and debt balance, internal account numbers and the total amount owed on approximately 64 delinquent debtors.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The DMDC computer database file contains approximately 10 million records of active duty and retired military members,
including the Reserve and Guard, and the OPM government wide Federal civilian records of current and retired Federal
employees.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
DMDC will match the SSN on the DOE diskette by computer against the DMDC database. Matching records, hits based on SSN,
will produce data elements of the member's name, SSN, service or agency, and current work or home address.

 notice with no significant adverse public comments in receipt resulting in a contrary determination, then this computer
matching program becomes effective and the respective agencies may begin the exchange of data 30 days after the date
of this published notice at a mutually agreeable time and will be repeated annually. Under no circumstances shall
the matching program be implemented before the 30 day public notice period for comment has elapsed as this time period
cannot be waived. By agreement between DOE and DMDC, the matching program will be in effect and continue for 18 months
with an option to renew for 12 additional months unless one of the parties to the agreement advises the other by written
request to terminate or modify the agreement.
