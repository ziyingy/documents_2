Regulatory Guide 4.7 does provide effective separation from population 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
centers of various sizes. Under this guide, a population center of about 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
25,000 or more residents should be no closer than 4 miles (6.4 km) from a 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
reactor because a density of 500 persons per square mile within this distance 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
would yield a total population of about 25,000 persons. Similarly, a city of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
100,000 or more residents should be no closer than about 10 miles (16 km); a 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
city of 500,000 or more persons should be no closer than about 20 miles (32 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
km), and a city of 1,000,000 or more persons should be no closer than about 30 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
miles (50 km) from the reactor. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Commission has examined these guidelines with regard to the Safety 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Goal. The Safety Goal quantitative health objective in regard to latent 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
cancer fatality states that, within a distance of ten miles (16 km) from the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
reactor, the risk to the population of latent cancer fatality from nuclear 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
power plant operation, including accidents, should not exceed one''tenth of one percent of the likelihood of latent
cancer fatalities from all other causes. In addition to the risks of latent cancer fatalities, the Commission has
also investigated the likelihood and extent of land contamination arising from the release of long lived radioactive
species, such as cesium-137, in the event of a severe reactor accident. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The results of these analyses indicate that the latent cancer fatality 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
quantitative health objective noted above is met for current plant designs. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
From analysis done in support of this proposed change in regulation, the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
likelihood of permanent relocation of people located more than about 20 miles 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(50 km) from the reactor as a result of land contamination from a severe 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
accident is very low. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Therefore, the Commission concludes that the current NRC staff guidance 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
in Regulatory Guide 4.7 provide a means of locating reactors away from 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
population centers, including ``major'' population centers, depending upon their size, that would limit societal
consequences significantly, in the event of a severe accident. The Commission finds that granting of the petitioner's

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
request to specify population criteria out to 40 miles would not substantially 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
reduce the risks to the public. As noted, the Commission also believes that a 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
higher population density site could be found to be acceptable, compared to a 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
lower population density site, provided there were safety, environmental or 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
economic advantages to the higher population site. Granting of the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
petitioner's request would neglect this possibility and would make population 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
density the sole criterion of site acceptability. For these reasons, the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Commission has decided not to adopt the proposal by Free Environment, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Incorporated. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Commission also notes that future population growth around a nuclear 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
power plant site, as in other areas of the region, is expected but cannot be 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
predicted with great accuracy, particularly in the long-term. Since higher 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
population density sites are not unacceptable, per se, the Commission does not 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
intend to consider license conditions or restrictions upon an operating 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
reactor solely upon the basis that the population density around it may reach 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
or exceed levels that were not expected at the time of site approval. Finally, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the Commission wishes to emphasize that population considerations as well as 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
other siting requirements apply only for the initial siting for new plants and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
will not be used in evaluating applications for the renewal of existing 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
nuclear power plant licenses.

Change to 10 CFR Part 50 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The proposed change to 10 CFR part 50 would relocate from 10 CFR Part 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
100 the dose requirements for each applicant at specified distances. Because 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
these requirements affect reactor design rather than siting, they are more 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
appropriately located in 10 CFR part 50. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
These requirements would apply to future applicants for a construction 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
permit, design certification, or an operating license. The Commission will 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
consider after further experience in the review of certified designs whether 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
more specific requirements need to be developed regarding revised accident 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
source terms and severe accident insights.

The following major changes in the proposed revision to Appendix A, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
``Seismic and Geologic Siting Criteria for Nuclear Power Plants,'' to part 100, are associated with the proposed
seismic and earthquake engineering criteria rule making. These changes reflect new information and research results,
and incorporate the intentions of this regulatory action as defined in Section III of this proposed rule including
comments from the public on the first proposed revision of the regulations. A specific document explaining the NRC
staff's disposition of pertinent comments will be prepared coincident with the final rulemaking.
