The Wisconsin Blue Flame Council cited an incremental unit cost of $150 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
to $200 to add automatic ignition devices and flue dampers to residential gas-fired water heaters. (Wisconsin Blue
Flame Council, No. 33 at 33). Equitable 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Resources stated the additional cost for electrical safety controls to be 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
approximately $20 to $50. (Equitable Resources, No. 72 at 2). 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Department used an incremental material cost of $49 for a spark 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
ignition system, flue damper, 24-volt plug-transformer, and control relay.

The Rocky Mountain Institute stated that DOE should study insulated 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
pressure relief valves, plastic drain pipes, and flexible anode rods. (Rocky 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Mountain Institute, No. 15 at 4). The Natural Resources Defense Council 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
proposed that DOE evaluate thermal short circuits through insulation. Work 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
performed by the California Energy Commission and the National Institute of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Standards and Technology showed that the effective thermal resistance is often 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
50 percent or less than the thermal resistance calculated from the level of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
insulation. (Natural Resources Defense Council, No. 13 at 27). 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Reduced heat leaks were included as one of the design options in the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
analysis of water heaters. The actual features of this design option were not 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
specified. Measures that could be included in this design option were to 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
eliminate thermal bridges from jacket to feed throughs, to eliminate voids in 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
insulation, to insulate the pressure relief valve, to install plastic drain 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
pipes, and to reduce the number of feed throughs by combining functions. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
These measures were not modeled separately. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The American Council for an Energy Efficient Economy proposed that 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
vacuum panels be considered as a design option. (American Council for an 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Energy Efficient Economy, No. 6 at 3). 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Vacuum insulation was considered as one of the design options for both 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
gas-fired and electric storage water heaters. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Rocky Mountain Institute stated that DOE should study more accurate 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
thermostats and pipe insulation. (Rocky Mountain Institute, No. 15 at 4). 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Department is not aware of any method to quantify energy savings 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
from more accurate thermostats. Pipe insulation, which is not part of the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
water heater, was not considered as a design option because of concerns that 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
it might not always be installed in the field. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Pacific Power stated its research shows that heat traps add only 1 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
percent to an electric water heater's efficiency, not 5 percent as assigned in 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the previous DOE testing procedure for water heaters. (Pacific Power, No. 53 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
at 2). 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Department used data from a letter report prepared for DOE.
<FOOTCITE>19</FOOTCITE>
 This 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
report determined actual heat losses out of pipe fittings with and without 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
heat traps. The letter reported that heat traps provide a savings of nine 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
watts on the hot water outlet and seven watts on the inlet. Applied to the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
baseline model, this results in a 2.5 percent increase in energy factor.

The Gas Appliance Manufacturers Association recommended that the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
multiple flues and submerged combustion chamber design options be combined 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
into a single category to be called increased heat transfer surface. (Gas 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Appliance Manufacturers Association, No. 40 at 4). 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Department found enough difference in efficiency and cost between 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
these designs to merit classification as individual design options. Water 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
heaters currently on the market with submerged combustion chambers have 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
recovery efficiencies of 85 percent, whereas currently available units with 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
multiple flues have recovery efficiencies of 80 percent.
