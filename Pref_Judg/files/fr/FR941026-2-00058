Phase II should result in a carefully documented examination of alternative approaches and the selection of an approach

Phase III: 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The purpose of Phase III is the completion of activities initiated under Phase II, the initiation of new activities
required to implement programs, and the design of on-site actions required to mitigate environmental damage from
DOD activities. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Phase III activities may include but need not be limited to: 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
&bull;development and implementation of a detailed management plan to: guide corrective action; resolve issues
rising from overlapping or conflicting jurisdictions; guide a cooperative and collaborative effort among all parties
to ensure there are no duplicative or conflicting regulatory requirements governing the cleanup actions; and, establish
a tribal or village framework and/or parameter(s) that will guide the negotiations process for one or multiple cleanup
actions; 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
&bull;establishment of priorities for mitigation programs when there are multiple clean-up sites; consider at
a minimum the nature of the hazard involved: such as its physical and chemical characteristics, including concentrations
and mobility of contaminants; the pathway indicating potential for contaminant transport via surface water, ground
water and air/soil, and any other indicators that are identified during the environmental assessment, including
the prioritization process identified under Phase II; 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
&bull;program design and implementation of information dissemination strategies prior to start up of on-site implementation
of mitigation program activities; 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
&bull;development of a legal and jurisdictional strategy that addresses DOD/contractor liability issues to ensure
quality, cost-effective mitigation services, and to evaluate any measures providing equitable risk between the
DOD and the remediation contractor, as well as to incorporate Tribal Employment Rights Office (TERO) and other policies
and procedures, if required; 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
&bull;design of an approval process and other processes necessary for the implementation of tribal and village codes
and regulations for current and future compliance enforcement of all mitigation actions; 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
&bull;development/design of a documentation strategy to ensure all DOD and contractor cleanup activities are conducted
and completed in a environmentally clean and safe manner for the social and economic welfare, as well as public health
of Indian and Alaska Native people and the surrounding environment; 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
&bull;development and conduct of certified training programs that will enable a local work force to become technically
capable to participate in the mitigation activities, if they so choose; and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
&bull;conduct of any other activities deemed necessary to carry out Phase I, II and III activities.
