in any conduct in the exercise of such rights or enforcement of such remedies that would constitute other than fair

(i) The Mortgagor has title or other interest in each item of (i) real and (ii) tangible personal property (``Personalty'')
comprising the Property in which a security interest is purported to be granted under the Loan Documents [and, where
Personalty is to be acquired after the date hereof, a security interest is created under the after-acquired property

In rendering this opinion we [I] also have assumed that the Documents accurately reflect the complete understanding
of the parties with respect to the transactions contemplated thereby and the rights and the obligations of the parties
thereunder. We [I] also have assumed that the terms and the conditions of the Loan as stated in the Documents have not
been amended, modified or supplemented, directly or indirectly, by any other agreement or understanding of the parties
or waiver of any of the material provisions of the Documents. After reasonable inquiry of the Mortgagor, we [I] have
no knowledge of any facts or information that would lead us [me] to believe that the assumptions in this paragraph are
not justified.

In rendering our [my] opinion in paragraph 13, we [I] also have assumed that: (i) all Personalty in which a security
interest is created under the Documents (other than accounts or goods of a type normally used in more than one jurisdiction)

located in

Opinion Certification, the Good Standing Certificate(s) [and certain other specified Documents,] as set forth
herein. After reasonable inquiry of the Mortgagor as to the accuracy and completeness of the Mortgagor's Opinion
Certification, the Good Standing Certificate(s), [and such other Documents], we [I] have no knowledge of any facts
or information that would lead us [me] to believe that such reliance is not justified.
