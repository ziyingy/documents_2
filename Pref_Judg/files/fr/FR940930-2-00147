Notice is hereby given in accordance with the Federal Advisory Committee Act (FACA), 5 U.S.C. Appendix (1988), that
a meeting of the Native American Graves Protection and Repatriation Act Review Committee will be held on November
17, 18, and 19, 1994, in Albany, N.Y.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
On Thursday and Friday The Committee will meet at the New York State Museum, Clark Auditorium, Madison Avenue, Albany,
New York. On Saturday the meeting will be held in the New York State Museum's Members Lounge. Meetings will begin each
day at 8:30 a.m. and conclude not later than 5:00 p.m.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Native American Graves Protection and Repatriation Act Review Committee was established by Public Law 101&hyph;601
to monitor, review, and assist in implementation of the inventory and identification process and repatriation activities
required under the statute.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Committee is soliciting comments from members of the public regarding: 1) the disposition of culturally unidentifiable
human remains in museum or Federal collections; and 2) the disposition of unclaimed human remains and cultural items
from Federal or tribal lands. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Culturally unidentifiable human remains are those in museum or Federal agency collections for which, following
the completion of inventories by November 16, 1995, no lineal descendants or culturally affiliated Indian tribe
has been determined. Unclaimed human remains and cultural items are those intentionally excavated or inadvertently
discovered on Federal or tribal lands after November 16, 1990, for which, after following the process outlined in
section 3 of the statute (25 U.S.C. 3002), no lineal descendant or Indian tribe has made a claim. The Committee is responsible
for recommending specific actions for developing a process for disposition of unidentified human remains and unclaimed
human remains and cultural items. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Committee may also review written evidence regarding a dispute referred to the Committee by the United States
Marine Corps in Hawaii.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The meeting will be open to the public. However, facilities and space for accommodating members of the public are limited.
Persons will be accommodated on a first-come, first-served basis. Any member of the public may file a written statement
concerning the matters to be discussed with Dr. Francis P. McManamon, Departmental Consulting Archeologist.
