SUMMARY:
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
 The U.S. Department of Energy's (DOE) Office of Environmental Management (EM) is soliciting information from private
companies regarding their capabilities to demonstrate new and innovative technologies that may accelerate or enhance
site activities in characterization, treatment, remediation, and storage/disposal of mixed radioactive/hazardous
wastes at federal facilities in the Western United States. This is not a solicitation for government proposals or
bids for procurement or financial assistance, but rather a request for information on new and innovative technologies
which may address characterization, treatment, and storage/disposal of mixed or hazardous waste. Based on information
received from this RFI, a formal RFP(s) may be issued focusing on specific needs and site characteristics.

SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
 The responses to the RFI will be reviewed by the Mixed Radioactive/Hazardous Waste Working Group of the Federal Advisory
Committee to Develop On-Site Innovative Technologies (DOIT Committee). The DOIT Committee consists of the Secretaries
of the U.S. Departments of Energy, Defense, and the Interior, the Administrator of the U.S. Environmental Protection
Agency, and members of the Western Governor's Association (or their designees). The Federal Advisory Committee
will recommend a program to review information concerning technologies regarding environmental restoration/
waste management at DOE sites in western states; recommending demonstration projects for implementation; and identifying
regulatory, institutional, or other barriers to technology development. Pursuant to the Advisory Committee's
Charter, the initial lead agency is the Department of Energy, for which the Office of Technology Development serves
as the coordinating office.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The Department of Energy has requested funding in its budget proposal for a project to conduct field demonstrations
of innovative technology involving mixed waste (characterization, treatment, and storage/disposal) beginning
in calendar year 1995. This program will implement the recommendations of the DOIT Committee. The goal will be to expedite
cleanup of federal sites by demonstrating environmental technologies which will address regulatory barriers and
public concerns throughout the technology demonstration project process. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Factors that should be addressed in descriptions of cleanup technology are:

<!-- PJG QTAG 02 -->
<!-- PJG /QTAG -->
 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=15 g=1 f=1 -->
_Ability to alleviate risks to public health and safety and to the environment; 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
_Capacity for public acceptance, permit and regulatory issues; 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
_Extent of private sector and multi-agency involvement; 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
_Potential for technology transfer or commercialization; 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
_Likelihood of successful demonstration (technical risks, technology component and system); 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
_Capacity for volume reduction of hazardous and radioactive components; 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
_Viability of final waste forms and treated secondary waste forms which can gain public acceptance, be relatively
stable, and meet regulatory criteria; 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
_Magnitude of recycling and material recovery potential; and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
_Ease of implementation to full scale initiative.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Additionally, the following factors are considered to be important by the Mixed Radioactive/Hazardous Waste Working
Group of the Committee in its review of cleanup technologies: 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG QTAG 02 -->
<!-- PJG /QTAG -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=15 g=1 f=1 -->
_The extent to which the technologies will ultimately remediate mixed waste at sites in one or more of the following
states and territories: Alaska, American Samoa, Arizona, California, Colorado, Guam, Hawaii, Idaho, Kansas, Montana,
Nebraska, Nevada, New Mexico, North Dakota, Northern Marianna Islands, Oregon, South Dakota, Texas, Utah, Washington,
and Wyoming; 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
_The magnitude of the problem to which this technology can be applied (total volume, multiple sites, etc.); and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
_The extent to which the stakeholders will want to support DOE's development of the technology.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Interested parties should submit a short paper not to exceed five (5) pages that will describe the technology and explain
why it will ultimately achieve the above mentioned objectives. If possible, papers should not include corporate
and proprietary information. Respondents are advised to clearly identify any and all proprietary data submitted
in response to this RFI, so that the Department is made aware of information which may need such protection. The duty
to identify proprietary information is not the responsibility of the Department of Energy. In addition, the Department
is under no obligation to pay for the expenses of submitting responses to the RFI. The dates on which the Working Group
will discuss specific concept papers will be published in advance in the
