The objection of numerous commenters to the language of paragraph (b)(3) as it applies to the creditworthiness of
``the country to which the Vessel is to be exported'' is, in part, well taken. Some Vessel owners will document their
Vessel under a flag of convenience that bears no commercial relationship to the country in which the shipowner or charterer
has its principal place of business. Of course, MARAD, as mortgagee, is concerned about the enforceability of its
security interests in the various jurisdictions involved in the business plan of the Vessel, including the enforceability
of a mortgage under a flag of convenience. However, the country of the ship's documentation is not the issue here. The
problems intended to be addressed by paragraph (b)(3) deal with the creditworthiness of the country in which the shipowner
and its charterers have their chief executive offices and have located a substantial portion of their assets. It is
in those places where MARAD will have to enforce deficiency judgments or pursue enforcement of Guarantees. Among
other things, these problems of enforcement include (1) the convertibility and the stability of currency from the
shipowner's or the applicable (bareboat or time) charterers' countries, (2) the likelihood of political violence,
expropriation, and government sanctioned repudiation of contracts, (3) the ability to enforce contract rights
in the juridical systems of the shipowner's and charterers' countries, (4) the likelihood that MARAD could enforce
sovereign and corporate guarantees, (5) the existence of acceptable lien filing and bankruptcy systems, and (6)
the stability of the banking systems. Accordingly, MARAD has revised paragraph (b)(3) to state that ``Such Guarantee
shall not be approved unless the Secretary determines that the countries in which the shipowner, its charterers,
guarantors, or other financial interests, if any, supporting the proposed transaction have their chief executive
offices or have located a substantial portion of their assets, present an acceptable financial or legal risk to MARAD's
collateral interests.''

Several shipyards and other commenters proposed that the Secretary should make liberal use of the maximum 25-year
duration for Guarantees in paragraph (a), and should disregard the provisions in the Organization for Economic Co-operation
and Development's (OECD) Arrangement on Guidelines for Officially Supported Export Credits that preclude financing
for more than 80 percent of the contract price of a Vessel and restrict financing to a maximum of eight and a half years
at a minimum interest rate of 8 percent.

 was amended in the interim final rule to allow the Secretary discretion with respect to Guarantees for all transactions
other than those for U.S.-flag Vessels owned by U.S. citizens. Two commenters objected to the requirement that interest
rates for U.S. Vessels must be ``reasonable'' while there is no such requirement for non-U.S. Vessels. One of the commenters
observed that while the intention of the legislation was to assist the shipbuilders, the specifics are offensive
when foreign owners are granted preferences by the regulation. Another of the commenters stated that there is no statutory
basis for Secretarial discretion with regard to interest rates for transactions other than for U.S. owned Vessels
that is similar to the discretion that exists in section 298.39 of the interim regulations. That regulation is based
on section 1111(a)(2) of the Act, as amended by the Shipbuilding Act, allowing the Secretary to meet export credit
terms of foreign governments. Therefore, it was submitted that the provision granting discretion in setting interest
rates should be eliminated.

One commenter noted that the word ``rates'' appears to be missing after the words ``.&blank;.&blank;. taking into
account the range of interest .&blank;.&blank;.''. The commenter suggested that, at the end of the paragraph, the
words ``with respect to each application'' be deleted and the words ``.&blank;.&blank;. with respect to the Obligations
to be guaranteed'' be substituted therefor.

MARAD Response: In issuing loan Guarantees pursuant to section 1111(a), MARAD is not subject to the OECD guidelines.
Among other reasons, the U.S. is not a party to the OECD Understanding On Export Credits For Ships and, further, Congress
intended MARAD to issue its Eligible Export Vessel Guarantees according to the same terms and principles it applies
in the domestic program. MARAD notes that an OECD agreement on shipbuilding subsidies was negotiated on July 17, 1994,
and still must be ratified by all parties thereto. If and when this OECD agreement on shipbuilding subsidies goes into
force, the terms of the Title XI program will be modified to conform. In the meantime, applicants shall be required
to demonstrate their qualifications for the current loan Guarantee program, on the basis of their creditworthiness,
the economic soundness of their proposed project and the value of the proposed collateral.

MARAD agrees that there is an unnecessary appearance of unjustified preference in the way interest rates could be
approved for the various programs and MARAD has removed in the final rule the last sentence of paragraph (c) as requested.
MARAD has also inserted the word ``rates,'' after the words ``taking into account the range of interest,'' in that
paragraph (c).
