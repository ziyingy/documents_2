To have its MSWLF permit program deemed adequate by EPA, a tribe must have adequate authority over the regulated activities.
Indian reservations include lands owned in fee by non-Indians. The extent of Tribal authority to regulate activities
by non-Indians on such land has been the subject of considerable recent discussion. The test for civil regulatory
authority over nonmember lands within Indian reservations was stated in

To be sure, Indian tribes retain inherent sovereign power to exercise some forms of civil jurisdiction over non-Indians
on their reservations, even on non-Indian fee lands. A tribe may regulate *&blank;*&blank;* the activities of non-members
who enter consensual relationships with the tribe or its members, through commercial dealing, contracts, leases,
or other arrangements. *&blank;*&blank;* A tribe may also retain inherent power to exercise civil authority over
the conduct of non-Indians on fee lands within its reservation when that conduct threatens or has some direct effect
on the political integrity, the economic security, or the health or welfare of the tribe.

Confederated Tribes and Bands of the Yakima Indian Nation, 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
492 U.S. 408 (1989), the Court applied this test. Both the State of Washington and the Yakima Nation asserted authority
to zone non-Indian real estate developments on two parcels within the Yakima reservation, one in an area that was primarily
Tribal, the other in an area where much of the land was owned in fee by nonmembers. Although the Court analyzed the issues
and the appropriate interpretation of 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 at considerable length, the nine members split 4:2:3 in reaching the decision that the Tribe should have exclusive
zoning authority over property in the Tribal area and the State should have exclusive zoning authority over non-Indian
owned property in the fee area. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Specifically, the Court recognized Tribal authority over activities that would threaten the health and welfare
of the Tribe, 492 U.S. at 443&hyph;444 (Stevens, J., writing for the Court);

 at 449&hyph;450 (Blackmun, J. concurring). Conversely, the Court found no Tribal jurisdiction where the proposed
activities ``would not threaten the Tribe's *&blank;*&blank;* health and welfare.''

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In evaluating whether a Tribe has authority to regulate a particular activity on land owned in fee by nonmembers but
located within a reservation, EPA will examine the Tribe's authority in light of the evolving case law as reflected
in Montana 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
and 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Brendale 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
and applicable Federal law. The extent of such Tribal authority depends on the effect of that activity on the Tribe.
As discussed above, in the absence of a contrary statutory policy, a Tribe may regulate the activities of non-Indians
on fee lands within its reservation when those activities threaten or have a direct effect on the political integrity,
the economic security, or the health or welfare of the Tribe.

As discussed above, the Supreme Court, in recent cases, has explored several options to assure that the impacts upon
Tribes of the activities of non-Indians on fee land, under the 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Montana 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
test, are more than 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
de minimis, 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
although to date the Court has not agreed, in a case on point, on any one reformulation of the test. In response to this
uncertainty, the Agency will apply, as an interim operating principle, a formulation of the standard that will require
a showing that the potential impacts of regulated activities of non-members on the Tribe are serious and substantial.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The choice of an Agency operating principle containing this standard is taken solely as a matter of prudence in light
of judicial uncertainty and does not reflect an Agency endorsement of this standard 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
per se.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 Moreover, as discussed below, the Agency believes that the activities regulated under the various environmental
statutes generally have serious and substantial impacts on human health and welfare. As a result, the Agency believes
that Tribes usually will be able to meet the Agency's operating principle, and that use of such a test by the Agency should
not create an improper burden of proof on Tribes or create the administratively undesirable result of checkerboarding
reservations. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Whether a Tribe has jurisdiction over activities by nonmembers will be determined case-by-case, based on factual
findings. The determination as to whether the required effect is present in a particular case depends on the circumstances.
Nonetheless, the Agency also may take into account the provisions of environmental statutes and any legislative
findings that the effects of the activity are serious in making a generalized finding that Tribes are likely to possess
sufficient inherent authority to control reservation environmental quality. See, 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

480 U.S. 470, 476&hyph;77 and nn.6, 7 (1987). As a result, in making the required factual findings as to the impact of
a solid waste activity on a particular Tribe, it may not be necessary to develop an extensive and detailed record in
each case. The Agency also may rely on its special expertise and practical experience regarding the importance of
solid waste management.
