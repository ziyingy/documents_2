The Lawrence Berkeley Laboratory-Manufacturer Impact Model results for all classes of conventional cooking tops
show that revised standards would have slight impacts on a prototypical manufacturer's short-run return on equity
from the 8.6 percent in the base case. Standard levels 1 through 5 are projected to produce short-run returns on equity
of 8.6 percent, 8.4 percent, 8.6 percent, 8.7 percent and 8.7 percent, respectively. Revised standards have similar
effects on long-run return on equity, with some increases at the higher standard levels. Standard levels 1 through
5 are projected to produce long-run returns on equity of 8.6 percent, 8.2 percent, 8.8 percent, 9.5 percent and 10.0
percent, respectively. See Technical Support Document, Tables 5.1 and 5.2.

Most financial data of the type needed to characterize the prototypical manufacturer are generally not available
because most real firms are subsidiaries or divisions of larger parent companies. Hence, DOE assumes that the prototypical
firm has largely the same financial characteristics (e.g. debt-equity ratio, interest rate on debt, etc.) as parent
firms. Financial data for the parent firms are based on publicly available sources such as Securities and Exchange
Commission 10K reports and company annual reports.

The per-unit increased cost to manufacturers to meet the level 1 efficiency for microwave ovens is $5.00; to meet level
2, the manufacturers' cost increase is $6.05; level 3 is $7.90; level 4 is $20.40; and level 5 is $36.80. See Technical
Support Document, Table 1.15.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
At those levels of efficiency, the consumer price increase for microwave ovens at level 1 is $5.49; to meet level 2,
the cost increase is $6.78; level 3 is $9.14; level 4 is $25.38, and level 5 is $46.80. See Technical Support Document,
Table 4.8.

The per-unit reduction in annual cost of operation (energy expense) at level 1 is $2.67 for microwave ovens; standard
level 2 would reduce energy expenses by $2.93; standard level 3 by $3.16; level 4 by $3.44; and level 5 by $3.60. See Technical
Support Document, Table 4.8.

The Lawrence Berkeley Laboratory-Manufacturer Impact Model results for microwave ovens show that revised standards
would have little effect, except at the max tech, on a prototypical manufacturer's short-run return on equity from
the 8.6 percent in the base case. Standard levels 1 through 5 are projected to produce short-run returns on equity of
9.0 percent, 9.0 percent, 8.8 percent, 8.0 percent and 6.8 percent, respectively. Revised standards have almost
no effect on long-run return on equity. Standard levels 1 through 5 are projected to produce long-run returns on equity
of 8.6 percent, 8.6 percent, 8.6 percent, 8.7 percent and 8.8 percent, respectively. See Technical Support Document,
Tables 5.1 and 5.2.

A life-cycle cost is calculated for a unit meeting each of the candidate standard levels. For the representative classes,
life-cycle costs at all standard levels other than level 5, the max tech level, for electric non-self-cleaning ovens,
are less than the baseline unit. Of the five candidate standard levels, units meeting level 3 or 4 have the lowest consumer
life-cycle cost for electric non-self-cleaning ovens whereas for gas non-self-cleaning ovens, the lowest life-cycle
cost occurred for a unit meeting level 2. See Technical Support Document, Tables 4.4 and 4.6.
