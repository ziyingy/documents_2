Additionally, the order requires agencies to submit a list of all rules, except those specifically exempted by the
Office of Information and Regulatory Affairs (OIRA) because they respond to emergency situations or other narrowly
defined exigencies, to determine if the rules constitute ``significant regulatory action.'' ``Significant regulatory
action'' means an action that is likely to result in a rule that may (1) have an annual effect on the economy of $100 million
or more or adversely affect in a material way the economy, a sector of the economy, productivity, competition, jobs,
the environment, public health or safety, or state, local, or tribal governments or communities; (2) create a serious
inconsistency or otherwise interfere with an action taken or planned by another agency; (3) materially alter the
budgetary impact on entitlements, grants, user fees, or loan programs or the rights and obligations of recipients
thereof; or (4) raise novel legal or policy issues arising out of legal mandates, the President's priorities, or the
principles set forth in the Executive Order. ``Significant regulatory action'' is submitted to centralized regulatory
review by OIRA.

OIRA and the FAA have determined that this rule is not ``a significant regulatory action.'' However, a cost-benefit
analysis, including evaluation of cost-reducing alternatives to this rule has been prepared. This analysis also
contains the regulatory flexibility determination required by the Regulatory Flexibility Act and a Trade Impact
Assessment. If more detailed economic information is desired, the reader may refer to the full evaluation contained
in the docket.

Studies have shown that a significant PCF hazards exist in rotorcraft operations. In a study of rotorcraft crashworthiness
dynamics, the FAA found that burn fatalities and injuries account for about 14 percent of rotorcraft accident casualties
and occur in about 20 percent of the accidents in which there are injuries. In a study comparing rotorcraft equipped
with and without a CRFS, the U.S. Army found that average thermal casualty costs per survivable accident were 95.4
percent lower in CRFS-equipped rotorcraft, and that 50 percent of all rotorcraft accidents with a PCF are survivable
prior to the onset of fire. An FAA review of NTSB rotorcraft accident data from 1983 through 1987 shows that 295 accidents
occurred that involved a crash landing or collision with an object resulting in fatalities, serious injuries, or
combinations of fatalities and injuries. Sixty-three of these accidents involved a PCF, in which about 77 percent
of the occupants were fatally injured, as compared to 42 percent of the occupants in accidents not involving a PCF.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In the 63 accidents involving a PCF, there were 113 fatalities, 27 serious injuries, 5 minor injuries, and one noninjury.
The FAA estimates that the use of CRFS's would have altered these casualty distributions to approximately the following:
83 fatalities, 31 serious injuries, 24 minor injuries, and 8 noninjuries_a difference of 30 fewer fatalities with
some of the fatalities being reduced to serious injuries (4) and minor injuries (19).
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In order to provide the public and government officials with a benchmark comparison of the expected safety benefits
of rulemaking actions with estimated costs over an extended period of time, the FAA currently uses a minimum value
of $1.5 million to statistically represent an avoided fatality. Serious injuries are estimated to have an average
cost of $640,000, and minor injuries are estimated to have an average cost of $2,300. Applying these values to the calculated
differences yields benefits of about $42 million [(30 fewer fatalities &times; $1.5 million) ^ (4 more serious injuries
&times; $640,000) ^ (19 more minor injuries &times; $2,300)]. The average benefit per accident involving a PCF is
approximately $670,000. Accounting for parts 27 and 29 separately, the average benefits are approximately $464,000
per part 27 rotorcraft accident involving a PCF and approximately $1,638,000 per part 29 rotorcraft accident involving
a PCF.

During the 5-year study period, an average of 5,450 part 27 rotorcraft and an average of 1,150 part 29 rotorcraft were
in operation in the United States. During this period, the annual probability of a part 27 rotorcraft being involved
in a serious survivable accident with a PCF is estimated to be 1.903 &times; 10

 ((52 accidents / 5,450 part 27 rotorcraft) / 5 years). The corresponding probability for part 29 rotorcraft is 1.913

 ((11 accidents / 1,150 part 29 rotorcraft) / 5 years). Multiplying these probabilities by an estimated benefits per
accident with a PCF yields annual benefits of $885 per part 27 rotorcraft and $3,134 per part 29 rotorcraft. Assuming
15-year operating lives, these benefits when discounted equate to $3,103 per part 27 rotorcraft and $10,985 per part
29 rotorcraft.

This rule will increase costs for both rotorcraft manufacturers and operators. Manufacturers will incur increased
development, certification, and production costs; and operators (in addition to absorbing these costs in higher
rotorcraft acquisition costs) will incur increased operating costs due to the additional weight of the fuel system.
