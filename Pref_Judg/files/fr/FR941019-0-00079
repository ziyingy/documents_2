<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 of June 6, 1991 (56 FR 25993), the Commodity Credit Corporation (CCC) issued an interim rule to revise the regulations
for the CCC Export Credit Guarantee Program (GSM&hyph;102) and the CCC Intermediate Export Credit Guarantee Program
(GSM&hyph;103) administered by FAS, USDA on behalf of CCC, pursuant to program regulations codified at 7 CFR Part
1493 and through the issuance of ``Program Announcements'' and ``Notices to Participants'' that are consistent
with, and in addition to, these program regulations. The interim rule incorporated or withdrew all previously outstanding
operational requirements announced by FAS/USDA through Notices to Participants. The interim rule also incorporated
requirements established by the 1990 Act. Finally, the interim rule clarified several provisions previously contained
in 7 CFR Part 1493 to promote more efficient administration of the GSM&hyph;102 and GSM&hyph;103 programs. The deadline
for comments on the interim rule was August 5, 1991. Comments were received from five U.S. exporters (one exporter
submitted two separate responses), three producer associations, two U.S. financial institutions, one U.S. export
trade association, and one U.S. Government agency. These thirteen parties made approximately 66 separate and significant
comments regarding either the interim rule or the policy issues and the impact of policies involved in administering
the GSM&hyph;102 and GSM&hyph;103 programs.

General Comments
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
One commenter disagreed with CCC's statement that it has been determined that this rule will not result in ``significant
adverse effects on competition, employment, investment, productivity, innovation or the ability of United States-based
enterprises to compete with foreign-based enterprises in domestic or export markets.'' This respondent shared
that while the interim rule contained some improvements, some of the changes would restrict the competitiveness
of, and be detrimental to, the sale of U.S. goods. The commenter argued that the interim rule was an overreaction resulting
from the Iraqi default on GSM&hyph;102/103 guaranteed obligations. The commenter acknowledged that the U.S. Government
must monitor the programs to prevent abuse but contended that, in general, free market conditions should prevail.
While CCC agrees that the GSM&hyph;102/103 programs should avoid unduly restricting normal commercial practices,
the Department has been mandated by Congress to implement measures to guard against program abuse. It is the Department's
intention to adopt necessary program safeguards while still enhancing the ability of U.S. exporters to compete in
foreign markets.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Four commenters supported and commended the USDA's efforts to catalogue and codify many of the operational features
of the programs, to assure that the regulations are being met, and to create more accountability within the programs.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Four other commenters felt that the intention of the interim rule to ``*&blank;*&blank;* simplify material, enhance
clarity, eliminate duplication and facilitate their use *&blank;*&blank;*'' has not been met. These commenters
stated that the interim rule is complicated, unclear at some points, and unnecessarily duplicative. The commenter
argued and that, more than ever, the regulations contain burdensome regulatory features which could constrain the
programs' effectiveness. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
One commenter felt that the interests of program simplification have been abandoned and that undue burdens are being
placed on participants to protect the programs from a few perceived manipulations. This commenter suggested that
the program is not ``user friendly'' when administrators focus only on protecting the programs from all risk, or on
shifting all risk to the exporter or buyer. Another respondent felt that the lack of USDA guidance on pertinent issues
is not only frustrating, but may have also compromised the strengths of the U.S. agricultural system. CCC agrees that
the interim rule contains regulatory features that place additional burdens on program participants, such as added
certification statements, requirements to maintain arrival documentation, and longer retention time on transaction
records. Although such requirements may compare unfavorably with the simplicity of the prior regulations, these
requirements are mandated by the 1990 Act. On the other hand, CCC has also made changes that consolidate program requirements.
For example, policy and additional program requirements previously contained in a number of Notices to Participants
were incorporated into the interim rule. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Five commenters felt that the revised regulations are a response to criticism of the GSM&hyph;102/103 programs and
pressure on program administration brought on by prior audits and investigations by the General Accounting Office
and USDA's Office of the Inspector General. Another commenter stated that since auditors do not create exports for
the U.S. economy and have no responsibility for market development there is a need to re-establish teamwork between
FAS and the export community to resolve key issues. One commenter felt the intent of the 1990 Farm Bill was to streamline
program procedures, but, in actuality, the programs are more bureaucratic than ever. This same commenter felt that
the USDA has forgotten that the GSM&hyph;102/103 programs are commercial programs, that the programs must reflect
commercial realities, and that recent studies and audits have not focused on the commercial and competitive viability
of the GSM&hyph;102/103. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
CCC acknowledges these concerns. In addressing audit and investigation reports on its commercial export programs,
CCC has attempted to put in perspective the relatively low incidence of program violations in the programs. However,
given that many of the requirements of the interim rule aimed at preventing program abuses were mandated by the 1990
Act, CCC cannot concur that the primary legislative intent was to ``streamline procedures.'' 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Three respondents recommended that the interim rule be revised to allow financial institutions to use the commercial
banking practice of securitization as a financing technique for CCC-guaranteed credits. Securitization would
involve the packaging of such credits by a U.S. financial institution for sale to third parties as U.S.-government
guaranteed securities. It is asserted that securitization would expand sources, and perhaps reduce the cost, of
financing for CCC-guaranteed credits. However, respondents point out that certain program regulations and CCC
policies now make securitization infeasible. For example, regulations require that the guarantee holder who has
experienced a default and filed a claim with CCC must turn all recoveries ``from any source whatsoever'' over to CCC
for pro rata sharing (&sect;1493.130(b)(1)). This provision is intended to ensure that the U.S. party financing
the transaction always remains at risk for the portion of the credit and interest not guaranteed by CCC. Generally,
this policy is seen as incompatible with the issuance of 100% U.S. Government-guaranteed securities since any collateral
put up by the foreign borrower to cover the portion not guaranteed by CCC could be subject to pro-rata sharing with CCC.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Similarly, U.S. banks point out that the unwillingness of CCC to pre-approve export and other documents that must
be submitted to support a claim on CCC in the event of default makes it impossible to issue high grade securities based
on CCC-guaranteed credits. Without pre-approval, such securities could not be marketed with absolute assurance
that claims on CCC for defaults on the underlying credits would be found in good order and honored. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
CCC has considered these and other proposals for securitization of CCC-guaranteed credits. However, CCC remains
of the view that, although the degree of risk-sharing may be adapted to meet program objectives, requiring risk-sharing
with the holder of the guarantee (normally a U.S. bank) is an essential feature of the GSM&hyph;102/103 programs.
It forces the private sector to engage in risk assessment relating to individual transactions, and thereby supplements
the risk assessment done by CCC prior to announcing export credit guarantee programs for specific countries. Removing
this requirement would also reduce the incentive banks now have to press for recovery of late payments from foreign
banks rather than claiming immediately on CCC. CCC does not have the resources that would be required to pre-approve
documents and to effectively manage the increase in claims and follow-up recovery efforts that would go hand-in-hand
with changing the specified provisions of the GSM&hyph;102/103 regulations to facilitate securitization. For
these reasons, CCC is not prepared at this time to propose program changes to facilitate securitization of its credit
guarantees. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Two comments were received regarding republishing the rule. One respondent suggested that the USDA republish the
regulations on a routine basis, requesting public comments, to insure that improvements in the programs may be continually
advocated and effected. Another commenter suggested a redraft of areas of greatest controversy and republication
with request for comments. CCC agrees that the GSM&hyph;102/103 program regulations are important and should be
reviewed periodically. It is CCC's policy to do this. However, publication of an additional interim rule at this time
would further delay implementation of a final rule which is needed to establish a basic permanent framework for the
programs. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
One commenter felt that the delays in the administrative process increase exporter risks and costs and inhibit the
programs' effectiveness. This respondent recommended that the regulations include absolute deadlines governing
the USDA's performance of administrative functions. CCC recognizes that administrative delays in processing applications
and issuing guarantees may result in additional costs and risks to exporters, and CCC is, therefore, committed to
expediting existing administrative procedures. However, it is not feasible to establish absolute time-frames
for actions because many administrative delays may be due to the failure of participants to provide all required information,
or are the unavoidable consequence of increased program activity during specific time periods. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
One respondent recommended that a special trade advisory committee be established to address controversial provisions
of program regulations. The commenter called on the Agricultural Policy Advisory Committee (APAC) and the Agricultural
Technical Advisory Committee (ATAC) to devote attention to these programs. CCC disagrees that a special trade advisory
committee is warranted. Considerable debate was aired when Congress developed the 1990 Act which mandated changes
to the GSM&hyph;102/103 programs. The Department also has considerable experience in administering credit and
credit guarantee programs, and has a continuing dialogue with private sector program participants on administrative
and other program policies. CCC believes that the rulemaking process should remain the primary vehicle for obtaining
views of interested parties. This process gives an equal opportunity to all parties, is part of the public record,
and is required by law. The APAC and ATAC could consider GSM&hyph;102/103 issues if their members so choose. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
A commenter suggested that solutions to some of the problems are simply to modify the regulations, but other problems
require a comprehensive policy review by USDA policy officials. Another commenter supported a special credit facility
separate from the regular GSM&hyph;102/103 programs for the former Republics of the Soviet Union. These comments,
by their own admission, address concerns outside the content of the program regulations and therefore, are not considered
in this final rule.

The numbering system of the final rule differs somewhat from that of the interim rule. Some sections were added, some
were deleted. For the purposes of this discussion, the numbering system of the final rule will be used, except where
otherwise indicated. In addition to changes resulting from comments from interested parties, some additional changes
in language have been incorporated into the final rule for the purpose of clarification of specific provisions. These
changes are minor and not of a substantive nature.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
One commenter felt that, because of problems which previously impeded the timely provision of the credits to the republics
of the former Soviet Union, USDA needs to elaborate its ``creditworthiness'' criteria and should consider revising
current restrictions and limits on credit that make it difficult for many debt-burdened countries to participate
in the program. CCC notes that the 1990 Act prohibits export credit guarantees from being used ``for foreign aid, foreign
policy, or debt rescheduling purposes'' and instructs that CCC ``shall not make credit guarantees available in connection
with sales of agricultural commodities to any country that the Secretary determines cannot adequately service the
debt associated with such sale.'' Under this legislative mandate, CCC believes that the criteria of &sect;1493.4
cannot be changed in ways to meet the objective suggested by the commenter.

Eight respondents commented on &sect;1493.20(f), Discounts and Allowances. All comments, in one way or another,
recommended changes to this section to permit discounts and allowances that are consistent with customary commercial
trade practices. The commenters suggested specifically excluding from the definition of discounts and allowances:

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(1) Cash payments, under the terms of the export sales contract, made by the exporter to the financing institution
which reduce the amount financed and are notified to CCC as amendments to port value or export value as appropriate;

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(2) Credits against the sales price, under the terms of the export sales contract, which reduce the amount of CCC coverage
and are notified to CCC as amendments to the port value and exported value, as appropriate; 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(3) Cash payments by the exporter to third parties for demurrage, detention and overage insurance premiums; and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(4) Adjustments for destination weights in cotton sales. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The payments or credits described in comments (1) and (2) above, are discounts or allowances to the importer; however,
if properly reported to CCC and the amount of CCC's coverage consequently reduced, no program violation is involved.
CCC has, therefore, determined not to include these suggested exemptions in 1493.20(f). Items (3) and (4) are addressed
below. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
One commenter recommended that the definition of discounts and allowances should be revised to delete reference
to demurrage and detention settlements. The commenter stated that demurrage and detention settlements are normal
costs which may be incurred in an export sales transaction. When settlement funds are paid to an importer, the importer
is only acting as an intermediary in making these payments to a third party, i.e., the shipping line. Thus the financial
transaction between exporter and importer is unaffected. Similarly, payments of over-age insurance premiums to
underwriters because of an exporter's inability to otherwise charter a vessel of required specifications should
not be considered a discount or allowance to the importer. CCC concurs with these comments and has therefore, deleted
reference to demurrage and detention in the definition of discounts and allowances in this final rule.

Two respondents felt that there is a contradiction in the USDA's interpretation of &sect;1493.20(f). When a weight
increase occurs at destination, CCC makes no provision for amending the exported value to increase coverage. However,
when destination weights decrease, any adjustment by the exporter in favor of the importer is considered by CCC as
a discount or allowance and CCC requires that the value of the guarantee be correspondingly reduced. The respondents
argue that there should be consistent treatment in both cases, and that as long as there is coverage available from
the country line, adjustments to exported value should be made for both weight increases or decreases. CCC disagrees.
To guard against potential program abuse, CCC has instituted a system to price review all transactions for which GSM&hyph;102/103
guarantees are sought. The purpose of the price review is to insure that the sales price of the transaction being guaranteed
falls within a reasonable and acceptable price range given market conditions in existence at the time of the sale.
CCC's price review compares the particular price with representative prices at a U.S. export position, and is, therefore,
based upon U.S. export weight and grade determinations. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Thus, determining the port value and guaranteed value of the transaction, and CCC's contingent liablility under
the guarantee, on the basis of destination weights and grades would undermine the effectiveness of and could potentially
invalidate, the price review process. CCC recognizes that, in certain markets, the use of destination weights and
grades is a normal commercial term of contract and, therefore, will issue guarantees in connection with such transactions
to facilitate the export trade. However, since CCC is not able to conduct price reviews on the basis of destination
weights and grades (because the determination of destination weights and grades necessarily occurs only after the
commodities have arrived at the port of destination and, therefore, long after the application for GSM&hyph;102/103
coverage has been approved), exporters will have to bear the varied risks involved with contracting on that basis.
Those risks include the possibility that a decrease in weight or grade between export and destination will result
in an adjustment or settlement in favor of the importer; or that an increase will result in an adjustment or settlement
in favor of the exporter. In the former case, the adjustment in favor of the importer would qualify as a ``discount or
allowance'' within the meaning of &sect;1493.20, requiring the exporter to report the occurence so that the guarantee
can be amended to reflect a downward adjustment in CCC's liability made because to do so could invalidate the price
review determination upon which the approval of the guarantee was initially made.

Two respondents felt that, in the case of cotton, a special exception should be made because of (1) the sensitivity
of cotton to fluctuations in atmospheric conditions resulting in gains or losses in weight; and (2) the long standing
practice of marketing cotton on the basis of landed weights and quality. Changing this practice, to comply with regulations,
will deny the cotton exporters the flexibility to market cotton efficiently.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
CCC has determined not to make an exception for destination weights for cotton. At this time there is insufficient
evidence available to CCC that the interim rule has caused any significant problems. As previously noted, when reported
properly to CCC, payment of allowances for destination weights is not a program violation. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Two commenters requested further clarification of what CCC considers discounts and allowances. Specifically,
they ask whether the definition encompasses carrying charges and normal customer service such as visits to the customer
(to inspect the product, observe its use in the market, etc.), technical assistance, and replacement of faulty or
defective products? The regulation's definition of discounts and allowances includes ``a promise to provide additional
goods, services or benefits in the future.'' Thus, CCC considers an exporter's contractual obligation to provide
technical assistance, or trade servicing, to be, by definition, a discount or allowance to the commodity price on
which CCC price review is based (unless, at the time of price review, the exporter justifies to CCC how such service
or assistance is incorporated into the price, and the price is thus approved by CCC). However, if an exporter does routine
servicing of accounts and customer visits, without any contractual obligation to do so, no discount or allowance
is provided under the definition. CCC has determined not to further modify the definition of discounts and allowances
because there is an infinite variety of circumstances under which exporters could provide a wide range of services
to importers. Exporters are obliged to report instances that may be discounts and allowances, and CCC will make a determination
on a case-by-case basis. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
One respondent suggested that: (1) the definition be changed to allow for normal customer services, and (2) the last
phrase be changed to establish a minimum threshold of 2.5 percent of sales value for defining quality, weight and certain
other settlements as discounts or allowances. CCC has determined it is inappropriate to set such a minimum threshold
because it could permit circumvention of the price review process.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
A comment was received regarding the definition of Eligible Interest in &sect;1493.20(g). The commenter felt that
the phrase ``the maximum interest rate stated in the payment guarantee, when determined or adjusted by CCC will not
exceed the average investment rate of the most recent Treasury 52-week bill auction in effect at that time'' seems
to imply that CCC is able to adjust the guaranteed interest rate after the payment guarantee is issued. The respondent
requested clarification. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
CCC's maximum liability for interest coverage is indicated in the payment guarantee or any amendments thereof. CCC
can issue payment guarantees at either a fixed rate of interest or at an adjustable rate of interest. In the case of a
fixed interest rate, the rate of CCC's interest coverage is determined as of the date of application for that payment
guarantee and is indicated on the face of the payment guarantee. This maximum eligible interest rate coverage will
not change. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
On adjustable rate coverage payment guarantees, the method or formula for determining the eligible interest rate
coverage is established for specific time periods. The operative phrase in the definition is ``when determined or
adjusted by CCC.'' For example, currently on GSM&hyph;103 payment guarantees which allow for an adjustment in CCC's
eligible interest coverage, the determination of maximum interest coverage is made on the date of export and adjusted
only on the due dates for principal. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
One commenter suggested that CCC adopt, at the option of the lender, a variable rate of interest coverage. CCC allows
the assignee U.S. financial institution to provide credit to the foreign bank on the basis of a variable rate of interest.
However, under the interim rule and prior regulations, CCC states in the Program Announcement for the applicable
country whether its guarantee coverage will be offered with a fixed or adjustable rate of interest coverage. CCC has
determined that if interest rate coverage were determined at the option of the lender, CCC would not be able to adequately
control its risk exposure. Therefore, it has been determined not to make the suggested change. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Five respondents commented on the definition of &sect;1493.20(h)(1)(ii), Exported Value, where CCC's payment
guarantee coverage is on the basis of FAS or FOB value on transactions sold on a CFR or CIF basis. All commenters expressed
concern that under this requirement the FAS or FOB coverage will be reduced should the actual freight and/or insurance
increase from what was anticipated at the time of the exporter's application for a payment guarantee. The commenters
noted that the exporter may thus find a portion of the sale amount is uncollectable under the letter of credit because
the financing institution will only pay the exporter the amount recoverable under the payment guarantee, plus the
bank's proportion of shared risk. Other concerns raised were that this requirement is impractical and will cause
problems for all parties because: (1) the actual amount of coverage may not be established until long after the sale
has been made; (2) the values stated in the letter of credit and the import licenses will not reflect the value in final
payment guarantee; and (3) the values in the final payment schedule will not reflect the values in the payment guarantee
nor will they reflect the agreement between the buyers and sellers at the time the contract was made. Commenters stated
that the requirement will reduce use of the programs because exporters may stop selling CFR and instead offer only
on a FOB basis. U.S. exporters could also be hurt if buyers, who previously purchased on a CFR basis, choose to charter
ships for themselves. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The arguments made by the commenters are compelling. CCC's intent in framing the provision of the interim rule was
not to expose exporters, importers or assignees to unmanageable risks. CCC has determined to revise &sect;1493.20(h)(1)(ii)
and &sect;1493.80(a)(7) to return to the practice of using the exporter's valuation of freight and insurance costs
at time of application for a payment guarantee as the basis for determining exported commodity value under the payment
guarantee. CCC recognizes that this change may be viewed as exposing CCC to an added measure of liability in cases where
actual freight costs turn out to be lower than estimated in the exporter's application. However, CCC notes that its
price review procedure confirms that both the overall CFR or CIF price and the implied FOB or FAS commodity price are
within acceptable ranges at the time of application. This ensures against exporters deliberately under-estimating
freight cost at the time of application in order to finance indirectly a significant portion of freight costs in the
commodity financing.

One commenter suggested that in &sect;1493.20(k), Foreign Bank Letter of Credit, the reference to International
Chamber of Commerce (ICC), Uniform Customs and Practice for Documentary Credits, Publication No. 400 be replaced
with ``latest revision'' to avoid the need for an amendment of the rule when the ICC updates this publication. CCC agrees
to this technical change and has revised &sect;1493.20(k) to reflect the suggestion and the fact that ICC Publication
No. 400 has been revised and issued as ICC Publication No. 500. We have also included the use of the copyright symbol,

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=6 f=1 -->

<!-- PJG 0037 unknown -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
to reflect the proprietary interest of the ICC in this publication.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Although no public comment was received regarding the definition of ``Incoterms'' found at &sect;1493.20(q), CCC
has updated the final rule to reflect the current International Chamber of Commerce's abbreviation for the term ``Cost
and Freight''. Accordingly, CCC uses the abbreviation ``CFR,'' makes such correction to &sect;1493.20(q), and
further acknowledges the alternative abbreviations, ``C&amp;F'' and ``CNF'', because of their continued common
commercial use. Additional language is also added to this definition to indicate CCC's position that contractual
obligations are incurred by the use of these terms by program participants. Additionally, we have again included
the use of the copyright symbol, 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

One commenter suggested that the phrase in &sect;1493.20(s), Late Interest, `` *&blank;*&blank;* beginning on
the first day after which the claim for loss is found in good order by CCC *&blank;*&blank;* '' be changed to `` *&blank;*&blank;*
beginning on the first day after receipt of a claim which CCC has determined to be in good order *&blank;*&blank;* ''
in order to be consistent with &sect;1493.120(c), Late Interest Payment. CCC has determined that the definition
of ``Late interest'' contained in &sect;1493.20(s) be revised as suggested to avoid inconsistency.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Concerning &sect;1493.20(v)(3), Port Value, one commenter felt that when CCC announces CFR or CIF coverage, the
cost of bulk destination bagging should be covered by the credit guarantee, provided that the total cost of ocean freight
for bulk shipment plus all costs of bagging at the destination does not exceed the comparable cost of ocean freight
for bagged cargo. CCC does consider that packaging materials for bulk commodities may be an integral part of the commodity
sale. Hence, on a bulk commodity sale which includes destination bagging, CCC would permit the costs of bags, needles
and twine exported from the U.S. with the commodity to be included in the payment guarantee. Further, CCC will issue
payment guarantees on CFR or CIF sales with destination bagging, if all costs of the bagging at destination are deducted
as provided in &sect;1493.20(h)(3) and &sect;1493.20(v)(3). However, CCC disagrees that CCC should cover the costs
of foreign labor involved in destination bagging in its payment guarantee. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
A comment regarding &sect;1493.20(x), Related Obligation, suggested that since draft(s) are not always used, the
wording of the last sentence should be amended to read: ``The U.S. financial institution is entitled to such payments
because it has financed the obligation arising under the letter of credit.'' CCC agrees and has revised the language
of &sect;1493.20(x) accordingly.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
One comment was received regarding the applicant's financial responsibility. The commenter was concerned that
small European companies opening offices in the U.S. in order to take advantage of USDA agricultural programs can
and will make corrupt payments or grant after sales services because their maximum exposure is limited to a small office
and minimal assets. In its experience with participants under the GSM&hyph;102/103 programs, CCC finds no grounds
for this concern. Of those few instances of corrupt payments or after sales services that have been identified in CCC
guaranteed transactions (principally in connection with past sales to Iraq), such program violations have been
no more prevalent in transactions entered into by the U.S. offices of small European-based companies. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
This same commenter suggested that the determination of financial responsibility should be predicated on an applicant
having a minimum net worth of $5 million, or of an amount relative to GSM business done, such as 10% of estimated annual
business. It is CCC's view that setting minimum net worth requirements would unreasonably and unfairly exclude virtually
all small export companies currently participating in the programs. Small exporters play a significant role, especially
in relation to certain countries and certain commodities, and often where frequent small deliveries are desired
by foreign buyers. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In general, CCC's experience with the financial responsibility requirement introduced in the interim rule has been
unsatisfactory. The requirement appears to have little or no value in protecting CCC from financial exposure due
to program violations by an exporter. Nor has this requirement enhanced CCC's ability to recapture financial losses
by pursuing exporters for monetary judgments in the event of a program violation. CCC's potential financial liability
in issuing a payment guarantee is the risk of default from the foreign bank issuing the letter of credit. The rates of
transaction nonperformance and of program violations have been very low. CCC takes any program violation seriously
and pursues administrative actions against exporters shown to have violated the program or other applicable U.S.
laws. However, demonstrating a minimum level of financial assets, or meeting other financial tests, does not materially
enhance CCC's ability to recover losses. Such tests are unreliable and quickly outdated. Therefore, CCC has decided
to delete all references to financial responsibility from &sect;1493.30 and from &sect;1493.30(d)(1).
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
CCC has revised the scope of the certification statement required by &sect;1493.30(a)(6). This section has required
applicants to certify that ``the applicant; any owner, in whole or in part; or any employee is not currently debarred
or suspended from contracting with or participating in programs administered by any U.S. Government Agency.'' CCC
has determined that this certification requirement should be eased in recognition that large companies, especially
publicly-traded ones with many shareholders, cannot make the certification with absolute knowledge of its truth.
Section 1493.30(a)(6) now requires the following certification: ``I certify, to the best of my knowledge and belief,
that neither [name of applicant] nor any of its principals has been debarred, suspended, or proposed for debarment
from contracting with or participating in programs administered by any U.S. Government agency. (``Principals,''
for the purpose of this certification, means officers; directors; owners of five percent of or more stock; partners;
and persons having primary management or supervisory responsibility within a business entity (e.g., general manager,
plant manager, head of a subsidiary division, or business segment, and similar positions)). I further agree that,
should any such debarment, suspension, or notice of proposed debarment occur in the future, [name of applicant] will
immediately notify CCC.''
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In keeping with the above change in certification, &sect;1493.30(d), Ineligibility for Program Participation,
has been revised to delete subparagraph (4) which made ineligible any applicant employing any individual who is debarred
or suspended. This change recognizes that some applicants will not be in a position to determine whether or not a single
employee is debarred or suspended.

Section 1493.40 Application for Payment Guarantee

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Three respondents commented on the description and value of discounts and allowances, &sect;1493.40(a)(10). The
commenters suggested that this requirement is impractical because most discounts and allowances are not known until
the date of export and many times are not quantifiable until the goods have been discharged. One commenter felt that
if the intention of this requirement is to uncover any attempt to obtain coverage, through prior agreement, for an
amount greater than the value of the commodity transaction, a better approach would be to prohibit any discounts or
allowances which are not due to contingencies or acts which are not known at the time of sale. One commenter suggested
that this requirement be deleted. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
CCC has determined that to protect the integrity of the program and to limit CCC's contingent liability in the event
of a default, the definition of discounts and allowances contained in &sect;1493.20(f) and the required reporting
thereof under &sect;1493.40(a)(10) and &sect;1493.80(a)(8) is necessary and appropriate. Discounts or allowances
that are unknown by the exporter at the time of application for a payment guarantee, of course, cannot be reported to
CCC at the time of application. However, some discounts and allowances may be provided for in the sales contract. These
discounts and allowances should be reported by the exporter at time of application. If known discounts or allowances
are not reported to CCC at the time of application, CCC cannot adequately price review the transaction. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
When a conditional or contingent discount or allowance is provided for under the terms of the export sales contract,
it should be noted in the application, but not deducted from the port value unless agreed by CCC. This is because the
exporter may not know, at the time, whether the condition(s) will arise and the discount or allowance will be paid.
The exporter should report the value of the discount or allowance, if it has been paid, at the time of filing the evidence
of export report. If a payment of a discount or allowance occurs after the submission of an evidence of export report,
the exporter must report the value of the discount or allowance in an amended evidence of export report, and should
notify the U.S. assignee, if any (see previous discussion of this point concerning the definition of ``discounts
and allowance,'' &sect;1493.20(f)). In the event of a claim under the payment guarantee, CCC may hold an exporter
liable for value of the unreported discounts and allowances. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Section 1493.40(a)(14) has been revised in this final rule for the purpose of clarity. Applicants often were unable
to report the address of the foreign bank issuing the letter of credit. The language of this subsection has been changed
to now state ``the address or location'' of the foreign bank. CCC has determined this change will still provide sufficient
information to identify the foreign bank issuing the letter of credit.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Section 1493.40(a)(15) has been revised in this final rule to delete the requirement to include the estimated principal
payment due dates and amounts due. CCC is able to make this calculation using other information reported under this
subsection. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Section 1493.40(a)(16) has been revised in this final rule to add the number of the Export Enhancement Program, Dairy
Export Incentive Program, Sunflowerseed Oil Assistance Program or Cottonseed Oil Assistance Program Agreement
assigned by USDA, as applicable. This added information is not a burdensome requirement for the exporter and assists
CCC in tracking concurrent use of credit and subsidy programs.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
One comment was received regarding USDA's price review process established under &sect;1493.40(b). The commenter
questioned how USDA can properly determine a fair market price. The respondent felt that U.S. companies will lose
the incentive to be innovative and aggressive in creating markets for their products if the USDA controls prices.
This commenter felt that while high prices may indicate kickbacks or other improprieties and warrant a complete investigation,
the practice of price review should be used as a tool to monitor the program, and should not constitute ``price approval.''
The commenter recommended that the practice of price review should be eliminated from the regulations. CCC disagrees.
The price review procedure under the GSM&hyph;102/103 programs is not a ``price approval'' mechanism. Although
CCC does have the right to reject applications for a payment guarantee that, in CCC's opinion, do not reflect market
parameters, in practice, when a sales price raises questions, the exporter is given the opportunity to explain the
factors relating to the price. Often, after receiving such information, CCC has been able to approve the application.
CCC's intention is not to control the price that an exporter may negotiate with an importer. However, CCC does have
an obligation to review those sales prices which appear excessively high or low because they may be linked to possible
program violations, such as kickbacks, extra sales services or the inclusion of lower value foreign content in the
shipment. Therefore, the current practice of price review for GSM&hyph;102/103 program applications will continue.

One commenter questioned whether CCC considered normal customer service, e.g., visits to the customer to inspect
the product, to observe its use in the market, to provide technical assistance, or to replace faulty or defective products
to be extra sales services under &sect;1493.50(b). The respondent requested that CCC clarify and give examples or
guidelines of what is considered to be extra sales services. CCC cautions exporters that any extension of extra sales
services provided to an importer that can be directly linked to a GSM&hyph;102 or GSM&hyph;103 payment guarantee
may be construed as a discount or allowance which, although permissible, must be reported and deducted from the value
of the guarantee. On the other hand, an extra sales service not linked to the basic commercial intent of the transaction
(i.e., that is extraneous to the transaction) is prohibited. The instance, type, nature, and the extent of linkage
to the sales transaction must be examined on a case-by-case basis. As previously discussed in relation to comments
received concerning the definition of ``Discounts and Allowances,'' &sect;1493.20(f), CCC will review the specific
circumstances when they are reported. Therefore, CCC has determined not to provide specific examples of extra sales
services_extraneous and otherwise_in the regulations. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Two respondents made comments regarding &sect;1493.50(a), which requires the exporter to certify that the agricultural
commodity or product exported under the payment guarantee is a U.S. agricultural commodity or product as defined
by &sect;1493.20(z). While both commenters fundamentally agree with the U.S. origin requirement, they felt that
because of the changes in the U.S. market environment, particularly the U.S.-Canada Free Trade Agreement, a rigid
interpretation of the U.S. origin requirement will interfere with the normal operation of the U.S. grain marketing
system. The commenters suggested that an alternative to the U.S. origin requirement might be a ``transit billing''
system similar to the Agricultural Stabilization and Conservation Service's current policy for all commodity purchases,
except dairy products. Under transit billing, in the commenter's opinion, domestic origin requirements should
be satisfied if a grain handling facility containing commingled domestic and foreign origin commodities, has quantities
of domestic origin commodities equal to or greater than the quantity called for in the contract. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
CCC has reviewed the ``transit billing'' system and has determined that such a system will not meet the statutory requirements
of the 1990 Act because the definition of a U.S. agricultural commodity contained in Section 102(7) of the Act requires
that an agricultural commodity exported under the GSM&hyph;102/103 programs be ``entirely produced in the United
States.'' Transit billing would permit unlimited commingling of U.S. and imported grains with rules that would maximize
the likelihood that a warehouseman would always have a sufficient theoretical U.S.-origin stock position to be able
to fill export orders for U.S. grain. It would be a formula accounting system which would be unrelated to the actual
identity of the grain being handled. Therefore, it has been determined that transit billing would not meet the statutory
requirement. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Another alternative proposed by one of the commenters is for CCC to allow foreign agricultural components to be exported
but to provide no guarantee coverage on the value of any such components. The commenter proposed this option in reference
to bulk grains, an agricultural commodity, not a product of an agricultural commodity. As previously noted, Section
102(7) of the Agricultural Trade Act of 1978, as amended by the 1990 Act does not, in CCC's view, permit any foreign content
to be included in the U.S. agricultural commodity exported under the GSM&hyph;102/103 programs.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
One respondent asked if under &sect;1493.60(b), Period of Guarantee Coverage, the language ``the payment guarantee
will apply to the period beginning either on the date(s) of export(s) or on the date when interest begins to accrue,
whichever is earlier,'' implies that CCC will guarantee credits on which interest accrues prior to disbursement
of funds to the U.S. exporter. The answer is yes. CCC will provide a payment guarantee that includes interest coverage
which begins before the date of export from the U.S. in circumstances where the exporter has sold the commodity at an
U.S. interior point of loading of the export carrier (e.g., railcar or truck for export to Mexico). However, interest
coverage begins no earlier than the date interest begins to accrue under the guaranteed credit. This date could be
earlier than the date of disbursement of funds to the U.S. exporter if this was provided for in the foreign bank's letter
of credit or related obligation.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Comments were received suggesting changes in &sect;1493.60(e), Reserve Coverage for Loading Tolerances. Three
respondents believed the purpose of this provision is to allow the exporter to pay the guarantee fee only on the actual
amount of the coverage required, and recommended that the section be changed to allow the exporter to apply for a payment
guarantee (and pay the guarantee fee) based on any quantity, within the sales contract specifications, reserving
coverage up to the maximum contract tolerance. One of the commentors also felt that, as a result of the requirement
in the interim rule, exporters would pay excessive fees for coverage not used and credit availability would be encumbered
without product exported. CCC agrees with these comments and has revised the language of &sect;1493.60(e) to permit
exporters to apply for guarantee coverage, and pay the guarantee fee, on the basis of any quantity within the upper
and lower tolerance and to reserve coverage up to the upper tolerance. After export, when coverage has been reserved,
the exporter will be permitted to amend the payment guarantee and pay an additional fee based upon the difference between
the original payment guarantee quantity and the actual quantity exported.

Two comments were received regarding &sect;1493.60(i), Amendments. One commenter, a financial institution, felt
that a request for an amendment of the payment guarantee should not be restricted to the exporter, and that the assignee
should also be able to submit a request for an amendment. CCC disagrees. To do so would place CCC in the position of unilaterally
agreeing to amend, and possibly breach, a contractual agreement with exporters at the request of a third party. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The second comment received on &sect;1493.60(i) concerned interpretation of the phrase `` *&blank;*&blank;* any
amendment to the payment guarantee may result in an increase of the guarantee fee.'' The commenter felt if it is the
intention of CCC to assess fees for amendments, which are not always within the exporter's control, then this language
should be deleted. It is not CCC's intention to assess additional fees for all amendments. In response to the comment,
the language of &sect;1493.60(i) has been clarified to provide the possibility that CCC may charge a fee for a requested
amendment when, as a consequence of the request, CCC may incur additional liability.

Several comments were received on this section. A general comment was made regarding the proprietary nature of the
information submitted by the exporter. The commenter felt that any information submitted should be deemed confidential
and access restricted; neither foreign buyers nor competitors should have access. CCC has not included in the Interim
Rule or Final Rule provisions on the protection of participant information because this matter is governed by the
Freedom of Information Act (FOIA) and the Privacy Act. Moreover, section 402(a)(3) of the Agricultural Trade Act
of 1978, as amended by the 1990 Act (7 U.S.C. 5662(a)(3)) provides that ``the personally identifiable information
contained in reports under subsection (a) [records of the exporter] may be withheld in accordance with section 552(b)(4)
of title 5, United States Code.'' This section further provides that ``any officer or employee of the Department of
Agriculture who knowingly discloses confidential information as defined by section 1905 of Title 18, United States
Code, shall be subject to section 1905 of Title 18, United States Code. Nothing in this subsection shall be construed
to authorize the withholding of information from Congress.'' 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Three respondents requested that &sect;1493.80(a), Report of Export, be amended to allow 60 days for submitting
evidence of export reports for truck or rail export shipments because it is difficult to obtain the required entry
certificate into Mexico within the 30&hyph;day filing period. CCC recognizes that experience validates this comment.
In the past it has often been necessary for the exporter to obtain an amendment to the payment guarantee allowing an
extension of the time period for filing the evidence of export report. In a study of this problem, CCC determined that
an extension of the filing time limit from 30 days to 60 days for truck and rail exports would decrease the number of this
type of amendment request by approximately one-half. Accordingly, in this final rule &sect;1493.80(a) has been
simplified and &sect;1493.80(b) revised to provide a time limit of 60&hyph;days for filing evidence of export reports
for truck and rail exports. With this revision, &sect;1493.80(b) continues to provide for the filing of evidence
of export reports for shipments by other types of carriers within a 30 day time limit. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Further, for the sake of simplicity and expediency, CCC has deleted the requirement previously contained in &sect;1493.80(a)(9)
of the interim rule requiring the exporter or its assignee to report a final payment schedule showing the payment dates
and the amounts separately for both principal and interest. CCC now has computer capability to calculate this information
from the other information submitted in the evidence of export report and the terms of the payment guarantee. The requirement
for the payment schedule information has often been a hindrance to the timely filing of complete evidence of export
reports because exporters routinely must have their assignee submit this information. It is expected that this change
will expedite filings of evidence of export reports.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Two commenters requested clarification regarding &sect;1493.80(b), Time Limit for Submission of Evidence of Export.
This sub-part allows for an extension of the time limit if it is determined to be in the best interests of CCC (but not
if payments by the foreign bank are past due under the payment guarantee). The commenters would like to see clarification
of CCC's policies once a defaulting foreign bank is again current with its account. It was suggested that a sentence
be added stating that CCC will reconsider the payment guarantee status once the foreign bank resumes payments and
becomes current in its obligations. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
CCC has determined to address this comment by revising the language of &sect;1493.80(b) to indicate that if the report
required by paragraph (a) of &sect;1493.80 is not received by the time limit specified, the payment guarantee will
become null and void, but only if failure to make timely filing resulted, or would be likely to result, in: (1) significant
financial harm to CCC; (2) the undermining of an essential regulatory purpose of the program; (3) obstruction of the
fair administration of the program; or (4) a threat to the integrity of the program. Section 1493.80(b) will still
permit CCC to extend the time limit for filing of evidence of export reports if such extension is determined by the General
Sales Manager to be in the best interests of CCC.

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Two respondents commented on &sect;1493.90(c), which requires the exporter to certify that the exporter or exporter's
assignee has, and will retain, documents evidencing the obligation of the foreign bank for five years after the final
installment due date. Both commenters said that the exporter can make the certification for themselves, but that
they have no legal recourse at their disposal, to require the third parties to comply with this provision. The commenters
recommended that the certification be deleted. CCC has considered the comments made and agrees that the certification
can be deleted because the exporter or the exporter's assignee is already bound by &sect;1493.140(e)(1) to retain
documentation evidencing the obligation of the foreign bank for a period of five years after the final installment
date. This document retention requirement is further strengthened because evidence of the foreign bank related
obligation is necessary to submit a claim to CCC under the payment guarantee. Therefore, a certification that such
records are being maintained has little practical value. CCC has determined to delete the certification previously
found at &sect;1493.90(c) of the interim rule from this final rule.

Section 1493.100 Proof of Entry 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
A comment received on &sect;1493.100(a), Diversion, pointed out that while the exporter may contractually preclude
diversion of an FOB shipment, the exporter has no control over the importer's vessel; unless the exporter knowingly
abetted the diversion, there should be no implication of potential exporter liability to CCC under such circumstances.
Under &sect;1493.130(d) of the interim rule, ``the exporter may be liable to CCC for any amount paid under a payment
guarantee when it is determined by CCC that the exporter has engaged in fraud, or has been or is in breach of any contractual
obligation, certification or warranty made by the exporter *&blank;*&blank;*'' Further, the exporter's assignee
may be held liable to CCC under the same standard. However, &sect;1493.130(e), Good Faith, provides that a violation
by an exporter of the certifications, particularly &sect;1493.100 (Proof of Entry), will not affect the validity
of any payment guarantee with respect to an assignee who had no knowledge of such violation or failure to comply at the
time the exporter applied for the payment guarantee or at the time of assignment of the payment guarantee. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
CCC recognizes the burden placed on exporters with FOB sales in ensuring compliance with program requirements concerning
diversion. However, in view of the legislative mandate imposed on CCC to ensure arrival of program shipments in destination
countries (Title IV, Subtitle A, Section 401 of the Agricultural Trade Act of 1978, as amended by the 1990 Act), and
in view of the fact that CCC has a contractual relationship only with the exporter, not with the importer, CCC sees no
feasible alternative to the present policy of holding exporters responsible for maintaining proof of entry documentation
as a means of preventing diversion. This policy makes it in the interest of exporters to make every effort to obtain
binding commitments from foreign buyers to provide such documentation on FOB/FAS sales and not to divert shipments.
The strength of evidence of such efforts by exporters would undoubtedly be of material interest in any situation where
CCC suffered a financial loss on a payment guarantee and found that diversion had taken place. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Two respondents commented on &sect;1493.100(b), Proof of Entry. One commenter was unsure what is intended by this
section. Both commenters felt that the only reliable means of obtaining proof of entry is for the exporter to retain
a private surveyor at each location. They felt that this was an unnecessary cost and burden to the exporter and that
there is little justification for this requirement. Clarification of the section was requested. In adding the requirement
for proof of entry in the interim rule, CCC employed the basic requirements for proof of entry documents that are used
for the Export Enhancement Program (EEP). Although a surveyor's report would be an acceptable means of meeting this
requirement, CCC disagrees that it is the only reliable means of obtaining proof of entry. Many countries have provided
such documentation with respect to the EEP program. Further, in the event that traditional forms of entry documentation
are unobtainable, &sect;1493.100(b) permits CCC to consider other types of documents, which can be deemed acceptable
by the GSM. Finally, as stated in the interim rule, the requirement for proof of entry documentation on GSM&hyph;102/103
transactions is mandated by the 1990 Act. Therefore, CCC has determined that no further clarification or change is
necessary to &sect;1493.100.

Section 1493.110 Notice of Default and Claims for Loss
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
One commenter suggested that CCC adopt a ``Payment Certificate'' concept (currently incorporated in programs of
the Export-Import Bank of the United States (Eximbank)) under which one claim is submitted covering the payment of
the balance of the guarantee. In follow-up discussions with CCC, the commenter explained the ``Payment Certificate''
concept as being a mechanism where CCC would pre-approve documents that are normally submitted in the claim procedure
and issue a payment certificate which, when submitted at the time of claim, would be evidence that CCC would pay the
claim at a certain time interval after receipt of the payment certificate, notice of default, and subrogation agreement.
CCC has determined that, at this time, it cannot adopt such a measure because it has insufficient resources to review
and pre-approve all documents required for submission when filing a claim. One major difference between Eximbank
and CCC export credit guarantee programs is the sheer number of payment guarantees that CCC issues during a program
year, over 3,000 payment guarantees annually. Eximbank's guarantees are generally much larger in value and fewer
in number. It would not be administratively feasible for CCC to review documentation in advance of issuance of all
of its guarantees. CCC will continue to explore the possibility of adapting the ``payment certificate'' concept
to permit, for certain countries or particular foreign banks, a mechanism that would address the ``time certain for
payment of claims'' element necessary to facilitate securitization of CCC payment guarantees. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
 It should be recognized, however, that under existing CCC policy, only one claim need be filed (in the sense of providing
full documentation relating to the transaction). Thereafter, only certified notices of failure to receive scheduled
installments, reference to the original claim, and corresponding subrogation agreement need be submitted to CCC.
Accordingly, CCC agrees that &sect;1493.110 should be clarified to reflect this fact and has added a new paragraph
&sect;1493.110(c) to make this policy clearer. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
A commenter suggested that the reference to ``drafts drawn'' in &sect;1493.110(b)(4)(i)(B)(1), be revised to read
``obligations financed,'' since drafts are not always used as financial obligations. CCC agrees and has adopted
this clearer language in the subsection.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
One commenter questioned why, under Filing a Claim for Loss, &sect;1493.110(b)(4)(v), CCC requires a copy of the
previously submitted report of export to accompany the claim for loss. CCC requires this in order to accelerate the
claims payment process. CCC considers this a reasonable requirement and therefore, has determined that the requirement
of &sect;1493.110(b)(4)(v) remain unchanged.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
One commenter, a financial institution, made a comment pertaining to &sect;1493.120(a), Determination of CCC's
Liability, which states that CCC, upon receipt in ``good order'' of the information and documents under &sect;1493.110(b),
Filing a Claim for Loss, will determine whether or not a loss has occurred for which CCC is liable. The commenter states
that in order for securities to be viewed as ``government credit,'' there can be no risk that the payment under the guarantee
would not be made. The commenter also argued that, due to the extensive list of documents and information required
and the subjective judgement that such documents and information be in ``good order,'' a risk of non-payment by CCC
exists. The recommendation is to require that most documents and information be approved (or alternatively, that
the proper forms be pre-agreed by CCC) prior to issuance of the guarantee. This recommendation would eliminate the
subjective nature of ``good order'' and would eliminate the non-payment risk. This issue has already been addressed
under General Comments (securitization) and in relation to &sect;1493.110. Again, although CCC is not now making
changes to specifically address this concern, CCC will continue to look at possibilities to adapt mechanisms suitable
to CCC programs to facilitate securitization. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Two comments were received on &sect;1493.120(c), Late Interest Payment. One respondent (a Federal agency) said
that the late interest is short-term interest and that the rate factor should be based on the ``91-day Treasury bill
rate, not to exceed the 52-week bill rate.'' CCC agrees with the comment that it is more suitable to use a short-term
interest instrument for late interest. Accordingly, CCC has changed &sect;1493.120(c) to provide that late interest
is based on the 91-day Treasury bill. Similarly, changes have been made to &sect;1493.130(b)(1) and (2) to also reflect
the use of a short-term interest instrument as the benchmark for ``late interest'' to be paid both on monies owed to
CCC in a recovery, and on monies recovered by CCC and owed to an exporter or an exporter's assignee under pro rata sharing.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The other comment pertained to the securitization of payment guarantees. The commenter suggested that &sect;1493.120(c)
establish CCC's obligation to pay a claim within a specified time period. The commentor stated that this was necessary
because a risk of nonpayment or late payment by CCC would be unacceptable to rating agencies reviewing securitization
proposals which include CCC payment guarantees. CCC has determined not to adopt this suggested change for reasons
previously stated in relation to general comments on the interim rule and specifically on &sect;1493.20(s) and &sect;1493.110.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
One commenter suggested that &sect;1493.120(d), Accelerated Payments, be changed to allow payments to be made on
an accelerated basis at the option of the lender. CCC's policy is to not pay claims for losses in advance of a default
unless it can be determined to be in CCC's best interest to do so. If CCC were to revise &sect;1493.120(d) to allow an
accelerated payment mechanism at the option of the lender, CCC could be required to disburse funds to banks for installment
defaults which have not yet occurred. CCC has determined that this obligation would not be in its best interest, and
that &sect;1493.120(d) will not be changed.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
One respondent expressed concern that under &sect;1493.120(e)(1), Action Against the Assignee, failure of the
exporter to comply with the requirement to file an amended report of export to reflect post-export adjustments might
jeopardize the assignee's claim. CCC acknowledges the legitimacy of the commenter's concerns. Section 1493.120(e)
does not specify as to what actions CCC may take against the assignee for the failure of the exporter to file amended
evidence of export reports if, for example, later discounts or allowances are granted to the importer by the exporter.
Section 1493.120(e) states that `` *&blank;*&blank;* CCC will not hold the assignee responsible or take any action
or raise any defense against the assignee for any action, omission or statement by the exporter over which the assignee
has no knowledge, provided that: (1) the exporter complies with the reporting requirements under &sect;1493.80
and &sect;1493.90; and (2) the exporter or the exporter's assignee furnishes the statements and documents specified
in &sect;1493.110.'' In a post-export adjustment (i.e., a previously unreported discount or allowance) the assignee
would, most probably, have no knowledge of the exporter's action (consideration given to the importer) and omission
(not filing a corrected evidence of export report). CCC has clarified &sect;1493.120(e) to indicate that assignees
will not be held liable for failure of the exporter to submit to CCC any corrections or amendments to evidence of export
reports.

One comment was received on &sect;1493.130(b)(1), Receipt of Monies. The commenter suggested eliminating CCC's
requirement that all monies received by the lender from any source whatsoever after the payment by CCC of a claim be
paid to CCC. CCC has addressed this issue under General Comment regarding securitization proposals. CCC has determined
not to make this change. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Two respondents requested changes in the wording of &sect;1493.130(d), Liabilities to CCC, to take into account
that a technical breach by the exporter may be inconsequential, and that the breach may not have been the cause for any
payment made by CCC under the payment guarantee. The suggested rewording of this phrase is `` *&blank;*&blank;* or
has been or is in material breach of any contractual obligation, certification or warranty made by the exporter for
the purpose of obtaining the payment guarantee or in fulfilling an obligation under GSM&hyph;102 or GSM&hyph;103
and such amounts paid by CCC under the payment guarantee resulted from such fraud or material breach by the exporter.''
CCC agrees with the comment and this final rule incorporates language in &sect;1493.130(d) similar to that suggested.

Two comments were received regarding the restrictions of &sect;1493.140(a), Assignment. The commenters felt that
financial institutions should be able to place assets they originate into the world capitol markets and that CCC should
facilitate this goal by permitting more than one assignment of the payment guarantee. One commenter, a financial
institution, suggested that CCC allow the financial institution to extend the credit and assign such credit to a grantor
trust or special purpose corporation, such as a Funding Vehicle, established by the financial institution, or let
the Funding Vehicle itself take assignment and extend the credit. The same commenter also recommended that the language
in &sect;1493.11(a) of the previous regulations be included in this section. The previous regulation stated that
``The assignment shall cover all amounts payable under the payment guarantee not already paid and shall not be made
to more than one party, and shall not be subject to further assignment, unless approved in advance by CCC. Any such assignment
may be made to one party as agent or trustee for two or more parties participating in the financing.'' In &sect;1493.140(a)
of the interim rule, CCC deletes the final sentence of the previous &sect;1493.11(a). However, by deleting this language
from the interim rule, CCC did not intend to preclude its consideration of assignments of guarantees to various types
of financial institutions. CCC will consider acknowledging assignments that facilitate securitization of guarantees
and that are consistent with other program requirments. Therefore, although CCC has not restored the particular
sentence in this final rule, &sect;1493.140(a) has been modified to clarify CCC's policy. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Two respondents requested that &sect;1493.140(a)(3) be modified so that when CCC determines a financial institution
to be ineligible to receive an assignment of a payment guarantee, CCC will notify both the exporter and the financial
institution. CCC concurs with this suggestion and has adopted such provision in &sect;1493.140(a)(3) of this final
rule. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
A third respondent felt that &sect;1493.140(a)(3) could create difficulties for financial institutions because
the notice of ineligibility would reach them after they had extended credit. The commenter suggested that CCC notify
a financial institution of its ineligibility before the institution extends credit under an anticipated CCC guarantee.
CCC disagrees. CCC does not have the resources to continually monitor the thousands of U.S. financial institutions
which are potentially eligible to receive assignments and to notify those that would be ineligible if they were to
be assigned a CCC payment guarantee. Further, &sect;1493.140(b), Ineligibility of Financial Institutions to Receive
an Assignment, explains the conditions under which an assignment to a financial institution would not be acknowledged
by CCC. If a U.S. financial institution has reason to believe that it might not be eligible under this section of the
regulations, it may contact the Treasurer, CCC to review its situation. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Several commenters suggested that the provisions in &sect;1493.140(e)(1), Maintenance of Records and Access to
Premises, place unreasonable burdens on the parties involved in the transaction. One commenter, a financial institution,
was concerned that the blanket requirement of access to records pertaining to transactions conducted outside the
program may interfere with bank confidentiality. Although CCC understands this concern, section 402(a)(3) of the
Agricultural Trade Act of 1978, as amended by the 1990 Act, provides that officers or employees of the U.S. Department
of Agriculture are subject to criminal penalties for knowingly disclosing confidential information.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Another commenter felt that the records pertaining to transactions outside the program should be subject to review
only if they are directly related to transactions made under the program, and that the General Sales Manager's opinion
should not determine whether the outside transaction(s) pertain to program transactions. This commenter recommended
that the regulation apply to outside transactions which ``relate directly'' rather than that ``pertain'' to the
program transaction. CCC disagrees and has determined that the language of &sect;1493.140(e)(1) should remain
unchanged. On a case-by-case basis, and as determined by the GSM, CCC may need to examine records not directly related
to the GSM&hyph;102/103 transaction in order to determine whether a program violation has occurred (e.g., inventory
records may be examined to determine whether foreign content exists in export shipment under the program). 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Two commenters said that they can request agents, intervening purchasers, and related companies to make available
documents or information requested by CCC, but cannot guarantee access to third party records, particularly those
held by companies or persons located outside the U.S. This is particularly the case with documents which may be generated
by agents of the exporter, or by companies with special arrangements with the exporter which are foreign entities.
Because access to such records may be critical to CCC's efforts to monitor programs and to ensure their integrity,
CCC expects that the exporter will use its contractual and other means of influence to obtain those pertinent records
of the outside parties involved. CCC recognizes that exporters may only be able to obtain from such third parties copies
of those records that pertain to the GSM&hyph;102/103 export transaction in question. The final rule does not require
that the exporter retain all records of such third parties, nor those records pertaining to transactions conducted
outside the program. Further, the final rule does not require that an agent of the exporter, an intervening purchaser,
or parties with a special arrangement with the exporter must make available such records and grant access to their
premises. CCC would expect the exporter to be able to provide copies of any and all records relating to the transaction
held by these entities if so requested by government officials authorized to conduct program reviews.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Two comments recommended that &sect;1493.140(g), Submission of Documents by Principal Officers, be expanded to
permit an authorized full time employee of the exporter to sign all required submissions. CCC agrees with the comment.
On August 7, 1991, CCC issued a Notice to Program Participants which clarified the signatory requirements for submissions
to CCC. The policy reflected in this Notice to Participants has been included in &sect;1493.140(g) of this final rule
to permit principal officers or their designees to sign required submissions to CCC. However, the August 7, 1991 Notice
is not being superseded because it also applies to other export programs and contains examples of how such authorizations
by principals to their designees might be worded.

Overview
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
. (1) This subpart contains the regulations governing the operations of the Export Credit Guarantee Program (GSM&hyph;102)
and the Intermediate Credit Guarantee Program (GSM&hyph;103). The GSM&hyph;102 and GSM&hyph;103 programs of the
Commodity Credit Corporation (CCC) were developed to expand U.S. agricultural exports by making available export
credit guarantees to encourage U.S. private sector financing of foreign purchases of U.S. agricultural commodities
on credit terms. Under GSM&hyph;102, credit guarantees are issued for terms of up to three years. Under GSM&hyph;103,
credit guarantees are issued for terms of from three to ten years. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(2) The programs operate in cases where credit is necessary to increase or maintain U.S. exports to a foreign market
and where private U.S. financial institutions would be unwilling to provide financing without CCC's guarantee.
The programs are operated in a manner intended not to interfere with markets for cash sales. The programs are targeted
toward those countries where the guarantees are necessary to secure financing of the exports but which have sufficient
financial strength so that foreign exchange will be available for scheduled payments. In providing this credit guarantee
facility, CCC seeks to expand market opportunities for U.S. agricultural exporters and assist long-term market
development for U.S. agricultural commodities.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(3) The credit facility created by these programs is the CCC payment guarantee. The payment guarantee is an agreement
by CCC to pay the exporter, or the U.S. financial institution that may take assignment of the exporter's right to proceeds,
specified amounts of principal and interest due from, but not paid by, the foreign bank issuing an irrevocable letter
of credit in connection with the export sale to which CCC's guarantee coverage pertains. By approving an exporter's
application for a payment guarantee, CCC encourages private sector, rather than governmental, financing and incurs
a substantial portion of the risk of default by the foreign bank. CCC assumes this risk, in order to be able to operate
the programs for the purposes specified in &sect;1493.2.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(b) 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Credit facility mechanism
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
. Typically, in export sales of U.S. agricultural commodities, payment by the importer is made under an irrevocable
letter of credit. For the purpose of the GSM&hyph;102 and GSM&hyph;103 programs, CCC will consider applications
for payment guarantees only in connection with export sales of U.S. agricultural commodities where the payment for
the agricultural commodities will be made in one of the two following ways: 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(1) An irrevocable foreign bank letter of credit, issued in favor of the exporter, specifically stating the deferred
payment terms under which the foreign bank is obligated to make payments in U.S. dollars as such payments become due;
or 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(2) An irrevocable foreign bank letter of credit, issued in favor of the exporter, that is supported by a related obligation
specifically stating the deferred payment terms under which the foreign bank is obligated to make payment to the exporter,
or the exporter's assignee, in U.S. dollars as such payments become due. The exporter may assign the right to proceeds
under the letter of credit or related obligation to a U.S. bank or other financial institution so that the exporter
may realize the proceeds of the sale prior to the deferred payment date(s) as set forth in the irrevocable foreign bank
letter of credit or its related obligation. The GSM&hyph;102 and GSM&hyph;103 programs are designed to protect the
exporter or the exporter's assignee against those losses specified in the payment guarantee resulting from defaults,
whether for commercial or noncommercial reasons, by the foreign bank obligated under the letter of credit or related
obligation.

Program administration
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
. The GSM&hyph;102 and GSM&hyph;103 programs will be administered pursuant to this part and any Program Announcements
and Notices to Participants issued by CCC pursuant to, and not inconsistent with, this part. These programs are under
the general administrative responsibility of the General Sales Manager (GSM), Foreign Agricultural Service (FAS/USDA).
The review and payment of claims for loss will be administered by the Office of the Controller, CCC. Information regarding
specific points of contact for the public, including names, addresses, and telephone and facsimile numbers of particular
USDA or CCC offices, will be announced by a public press release (see &sect;1493.20(c), ``Contacts P/R'').

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Country allocations and program announcements
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
. From time to time, CCC will issue a Program Announcement to announce a GSM&hyph;102 and/or GSM&hyph;103 program
allocation for a specific country. The Program Announcement for a country allocation will designate specific allocations
for U.S. agricultural commodities or products thereof. Exporters may negotiate export sales to buyers in that country
for one of the commodities specified in the Program Announcement and seek payment guarantee coverage within the dollar
amounts of specified coverage for that commodity. The Program Announcement will contain a requirement that the exporter's
sales contract contain a shipping deadline within the applicable program year. The final date for a contractual shipping
deadline will be stated in the Program Announcement. Program Announcements may also contain a specified ``undesignated''
or ``unallocated'' dollar amount for the purpose that if dollar amounts specified for a specific commodity for a country
become fully used, an additional allocation from the ``unallocated'' or ``undesignated'' portion of the total country
allocation may then be designated for a specific commodity. Program Announcements that include an ``allocated''
or ``undesignated'' dollar amount will contain further information on the ``unallocated'' or ``undesignated''
portion of the country allocation.

By providing the statement in &sect;1493.40(a)(18), the exporter is certifying that the information provided in
the application is true and correct and, further, that all requirements set forth in this section have been or will
be met. The exporter will be required to provide further explanation or documentation with regard to applications
that do not include this statement. The exporter, in submitting an application for a payment guarantee and providing
the statement set forth in &sect;1493.40(a)(18), certifies that:
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(a) The agricultural commodity or product to be exported under the payment guarantee is a United States agricultural
commodity or a product thereof, as defined in &sect;1493.20(z);
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(b) There have not been and will not be any corrupt payments or extra sales services or other items extraneous to the
transaction provided, financed, or guaranteed in connection with the transaction, and that the transaction complies
with applicable United States law; 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(c) If the agricultural commodity is vegetable oil or a vegetable oil product, that none of the agricultural commodity
or product has been or will be used as a basis for a claim of a refund, as drawback, pursuant to section 313 of the Tariff
Act of 1930, 19 U.S.C. 1313, of any duty, tax or fee imposed under Federal law on an imported commodity or product;
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(d) No person or selling agency has been employed or retained to solicit or secure the payment guarantee, and that there
is no agreement or understanding for a commission, percentage, brokerage, or contingent fee, except in the case of
bona fide employees or bona fide established commercial or selling agencies maintained by the exporter for the purpose
of securing business; and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(e) The information provided pursuant to &sect;1493.30 has not changed, the exporter still meets all of the qualification
requirements of &sect;1493.30, and the exporter will immediately notify CCC if there is a change of circumstances
which would cause it to fail to meet such requirements. If the exporter breaches or violates these certifications
with respect to a GSM&hyph;102 or GSM&hyph;103 payment guarantee, CCC will have the right, notwithstanding any other
rights provided under this subpart, to annul guarantee coverage for any commodities not yet exported and/or to proceed
against the exporter.

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
. The payment guarantee will provide that CCC agrees to pay the exporter or the exporter's assignee an amount not to
exceed the guaranteed value, plus eligible interest, in the event that the foreign bank fails to pay under the foreign
bank letter of credit or the related obligation. Payment by CCC will be in U.S. dollars.

. The payment guarantee will apply to the period beginning either on the date(s) of export(s) or on the date when interest
begins to accrue, whichever is earlier, and will continue during the credit term specified in the payment guarantee
or amendments thereto. However, the payment guarantee becomes effective on the date(s) of export(s) of the agricultural

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Reserve coverage for loading tolerances
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
. The exporter may apply for a payment guarantee and, if coverage is available, pay the guarantee fee, based at least
on, the amount of the lower loading tolerance of the export sales contract; however, the exporter may also request
that CCC reserve additional guarantee coverage to accommodate up to the amount of the upward loading tolerance specified
in the export sales contract. If such additional guarantee coverage is available at the time of application and CCC
determines to make such reservation, it will so indicate to the exporter. In the event that the exporter ships a quantity
greater than the amount on which the guarantee fee was paid (i.e., lower loading tolerance), it may obtain the additional
coverage from CCC, up to the amount of the upward loading tolerance, by filing for an amendment to the payment guarantee,
and by paying the additional amount of fee applicable. If such amendment to the payment guarantee is not filed with
CCC by the exporter within 30 days after the date of the last export against the sales contract, CCC may determine not
to reserve the coverage originally set aside for the exporter.

or any amendments thereof, are ineligible for GSM&hyph;102 or GSM&hyph;103 guarantee coverage, except where it
is determined by the GSM to be in the best interests of CCC to provide guarantee coverage on such commodities.

Amendments
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

assignee, if any). CCC will consider such a request only if the amendment sought is consistent with this subpart and
any applicable Program Announcements and Notices to Participants. Amendments may include, but will not be limited
to, a change in the credit period and an extension of time to export. Any amendment to the payment guarantee, particularly
those that result in an increase in CCC's liability under the payment guarantee, may result in an increase in the guarantee
fee. (Technical corrections or corrections of a clerical error which may be submitted by the exporter or the exporter's
assignee are not viewed as amendments.)

the degree of risk that CCC assumes, as determined by CCC, and any other factors which CCC determines appropriate for
consideration. A current schedule of the guarantee fee rates charged by CCC under GSM&hyph;102 and GSM&hyph;103
will be available upon request from the FAS/USDA office specified in the Contacts P/R.

of the application will be final and refund of the guarantee fee will not be made after approval unless the GSM determines
that such refund will be in the best interest of CCC. If the application for a payment guarantee is not approved or is
approved only for a part of the guarantee coverage requested, a full or pro rata refund of the fee remittance will be
made.

Report of export
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->

(7) Unit sales price received for the commodity exported and the basis (e.g., FOB, CFR, CIF). Where the unit sales price
at export differs from the unit sales price indicated in the exporter's application for a payment guarantee, the exporter
is also required to submit a statement explaining the reason for the difference. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(8) Description and value of discounts and allowances, if any.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

export was by rail or truck; or 30 calendar days if the export was by any other carrier. The time period for filing a report
of export will commence upon each date of export of the commodity covered under a payment guarantee. If the evidence
of export report is not received by CCC within the time period for filing, the payment guarantee will become null and
void only if and only to the extent that failure to make timely filing resulted, or would be likely to result, in: 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(1) Significant financial harm to CCC; 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(2) The undermining of an essential regulatory purpose of the program;
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(3) Obstruction of the fair administration of the program; or

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
By providing the statement contained in &sect;1493.80(a)(10), the exporter is certifying that the information
provided in the evidence of export report is true and correct and, further, that all requirements set forth in this
section have been or will be met. The exporter will be required to provide further explanation or documentation with
regard to reports that do not include this statement. If the exporter breaches or violates these certifications with
respect to a GSM&hyph;102 or GSM&hyph;103 payment guarantee, CCC will have the right, notwithstanding any other
rights provided under this subpart, to annul guarantee coverage for any commodities not yet exported and/or to proceed
against the exporter. The exporter, in submitting the evidence of export and providing the statement set forth in
&sect;1493.80(a)(10), certifies that:
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(a) The agricultural commodity or product exported under a payment guarantee is a United States agricultural commodity
or a product thereof, as defined in &sect;1493.20(z);
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

(b) Agricultural commodities of the grade, quality and quantity called for in the exporter's sales contract with
the importer have been exported to the country specified in the payment guarantee; 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(c) A letter of credit has been opened in favor of the exporter by the foreign bank shown in the payment guarantee to cover
the port value of the commodity exported; 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(d) There have not been and will not be any corrupt payments or extra sales services or other items extraneous to the
transaction provided, financed, or guaranteed in connection with the transaction, and that the transaction complies
with applicable United States law; and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(e) The information provided pursuant to &sect;1493.30 has not changed, the exporter still meets all of the qualification
requirements of &sect;1493.30 and the exporter will immediately notify CCC if there is a change of circumstances
which would cause it to fail to meet such requirements.

or 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

Determination of CCC's liability
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
. Upon receipt in good order of the information and documents required under &sect;1493.110, CCC will determine whether
or not a loss has occurred for which CCC is liable under the applicable payment guarantee, this subpart and any applicable
supplemental Program Announcements and Notices to Participants. If CCC determines that it is liable to the exporter
and/or the exporter's assignee, CCC will pay the exporter or the exporter's assignee in accordance with paragraphs

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(1) The guaranteed value as stated in the payment guarantee, plus eligible interest; or 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

Late interest payment
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->

will accrue in favor of the exporter or the exporter's assignee beginning with the first day after the day of reciept
of a claim found by CCC to be in good order and continuing until and including the date that payment is made by CCC. Late
interest will be paid on the guaranteed amount, as determined by paragraphs (b)(1) and (2) of this section, and will
be calculated based on the average investment rate of the most recent Treasury 91-day bill auction as announced by
the Department of Treasury as of the due date.

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Accelerated payments
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
. CCC will pay claims only for losses on amounts not paid as scheduled. CCC will not pay claims for amounts due under an
accelerated payment clause in the export sales contract, the foreign bank's letter of credit, or any obligation owed
by the foreign bank to the assignee U.S. financial institution which is related to the foreign bank's letter of credit
issued in favor of the exporter, unless it is determined to be in the best interests of CCC by the Controller, CCC. Notwithstanding
the foregoing, CCC at its option may declare the entire amount of the unpaid balance, plus accrued interest, in default
and make payment to the exporter or the exporter's assignee in addition to such other claimed amount as may be due from
CCC.

. Notwithstanding any other provision in this subpart to the contrary, with regard to commodities covered by a payment
guarantee, CCC will not hold the assignee responsible or take any action or raise any defense against the assignee
for any action, omission, or statement by the exporter of which the assignee has no knowledge, provided that: 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(1) The exporter complies with the reporting requirements under &sect;1493.80 and &sect;1493.90, excluding post-export

. (1) In the event that monies for a defaulted payment are recovered by the exporter or the exporter's assignee from
the importer, the foreign bank, or any other source whatsoever, such monies shall be immediately paid to the Treasurer,
CCC. If such monies are not received by CCC within 15 business days from the date of recovery by the exporter or the exporter's
assignee, the exporter or the exporter's assignee will owe to CCC interest from the date of recovery to the date of receipt
by CCC. This interest will be calculated based on the latest average investment rate of the most recent Treasury 91-day
bill auction, as announced by the Department of Treasury, in effect on the date of recovery and will accrue from such
date to the date of payment by the exporter or the exporter's assignee to CCC. Such interest will be charged only on CCC's

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(2) If CCC recovers monies that should be applied to a payment guarantee for which a claim has been paid by CCC, CCC will
pay the holder of the payment guarantee its pro rata share immediately, provided that the required information necessary
for determining pro rata distribution has been furnished. If payment is not made by CCC within 15 business days from
the date of recovery or 15 business days from receiving the required information for determining pro rata distribution,
whichever is later, CCC will pay interest calculated on the latest average investment rate of the most recent Treasury
91-day bill auction, as announced by the Department of Treasury, in effect on the date of recovery and such interest
will accrue from such date to the date of payment by CCC. The interest will apply only to the portion of the recovery payable
to the holder of the payment guarantee.

Allocation of recoveries
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
. Recoveries made by CCC from the importer or the foreign bank, and recoveries received by CCC from the exporter, the
exporter's assignee, or any other source whatsoever, will be allocated by CCC to the exporter or the exporter's assignee
and to CCC on a pro rata basis determined by their respective interests in such recoveries. The respective interest
of each party will be determined on a pro rata basis, based on the combined amount of principal and interest in default.
Once CCC has paid out a particular claim under a GSM&hyph;102 or GSM&hyph;103 payment guarantee, CCC prorates any
collections it receives and shares these collections proportionately with the holder of the guarantee until both
CCC and the holder of the guarantee have been reimbursed in full. Appendix A to &sect;1493.130_Illustration of Pro
Rata Allocation of Recoveries_provides an example of the methodology used by CCC in applying this paragraph (c).

. Notwithstanding any other terms of the payment guarantee, the exporter may be liable to CCC for any amounts paid by
CCC under the payment guarantee when and if it is determined by CCC that the exporter has engaged in fraud, or has been
or is in material breach of any contractual obligation, certification or warranty made by the exporter for the purpose
of obtaining the payment guarantee or for fulfilling obligations under GSM&hyph;102 or GSM&hyph;103. Further,
the exporter's assignee may be liable to CCC for any amounts paid by CCC under the payment guarantee when and if it is
determined by CCC that the exporter's assignee has engaged in fraud or otherwise violated program requirements.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->
The following example illustrates CCC's policy, as set forth in &sect;1493.130(c), regarding pro rata sharing of
recoveries made for claims filed under the GSM&hyph;102 and GSM&hyph;103 programs. A typical case might be as follows:

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
1. The U.S. bank enters into a $300,000 three-year credit arrangement with the foreign bank calling for equal annual
payments of principal and annual payments of interest at a rate of 10 percent per annum and a penalty interest rate of
12 percent per annum on overdue amounts until the overdue amount is paid. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
2. The foreign bank fails to make the final principal payment of $100,000 and an interest payment of $10,000, both due
on January 31.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
3. On February 10, the U.S. bank files a claim in good order with CCC.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
4. CCC's guarantee states that CCC's maximum liability is limited to 98 percent of the principal amount due ($98,000)
and interest at a rate of 8 percent per annum (basis 365 days) on 98 percent of the principal ($7,840).
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
5. CCC pays the claim on February 22.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
6. The latest bond equivalent rate of the 52-week Treasury bill auction average which has been published by the Department
of Treasury in effect on the date of nonpayment (January 31) is 9 percent. The latest investment rate of the 91-day Treasury
Bill auction average which has been published by the Department of Treasury in effect on the date of nonpayment by CCC
(February 11) is 7 percent.

In establishing each party's respective interest in any recovery of losses, the total amount due under the foreign
bank obligation would be determined as of the date the claim is paid by CCC (February 22). Using the above example in
which the amount owed by the foreign bank is $110,000, CCC would be entitled to 95.75 percent ($106,063.07 divided
by $110,765.62) and the holder of the payment guarantee would be entitled to 4.21 percent ($4,668.55 divided by $110,795.62)
of any recoveries of losses after settlement of the claim. Since in this example, the losses were recovered after the
claim has been paid by CCC, &sect;1493.130(b) would apply.

Assignment
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
. (1) The exporter may assign the proceeds which are, or may become, payable by CCC under a payment guarantee or the right
to such proceeds only to a financial institution in the U.S. The assignment must cover all amounts payable under the
payment guarantee not already paid, may not be made to more than one party, and may not, unless approved in advance by
CCC, be: 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(i) Made to one party acting for two or more parties or 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(ii) Subject to further assignment.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(2) An original and two copies of the written notice of assignment signed by the parties thereto must be filed by the
assignee with the Treasurer, CCC, at the address specified in the Contacts P/R.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(3) Receipt of the notice of assignment will ordinarily be acknowledged to the exporter and its assignee in writing
by an officer of CCC. In cases where a financial institution is determined to be ineligible to receive an assignment,
in accordance with paragraph (b) of this section, CCC will provide notice thereof, to the financial institution and
to the exporter issued the payment guarantee, in lieu of an acknowledgment of assignment. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(4) The name and address of the assignee must be included on the written notice of assignment.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Ineligibility of financial institutions to receive an assignment
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
. A financial institution will be ineligible to receive an assignment of proceeds which may become payable under a
payment guarantee if, at the time of assignment, such financial institution:
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(1) Is not in sound financial condition, as determined by the Treasurer of CCC; or 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(2) Is the financial institution issuing the letter of credit or branch, agency, or subsidiary of such institution;
or 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(3) Is owned or controlled by an entity that owns or controls the financial institution issuing the letter of credit;
or 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(4) Is the U.S. parent of the foreign bank issuing the letter of credit.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Ineligibility of financial institutions to receive proceeds
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
. A financial institution will be ineligible to receive proceeds payable under a payment guarantee approved by CCC
if such financial institution:
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(1) At the time of assignment of a payment guarantee, is not in sound financial condition, as determined by the Treasurer
of CCC; 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(2) Is the financial institution issuing the letter of credit or a branch, agency, or subsidiary of such institution;
or
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(3) Is owned or controlled by an entity that owns or controls the financial institution issuing the letter of credit;

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Alternative satisfaction of payment guarantees
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
. CCC may, with the agreement of the exporter (or if the right to proceeds payable under the payment guarantee has been
assigned, with the agreement of the exporter's assignee), establish procedures, terms and/or conditions for the
satisfaction of CCC's obligations under a payment guarantee other than those provided for in this subpart if CCC determines
that those alternative procedures, terms, and/or conditions are appropriate in rescheduling the debts arising
out of any transaction covered by the payment guarantee and would not result in CCC paying more than the amount of CCC's
obligation.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
. (1) For a period of five years after the date of expiration of the coverage of a payment guarantee, the exporter or the
exporter's assignee, as applicable, must maintain and make available all records pertaining to sales and deliveries
of and extension of credit for agricultural commodities exported in connection with a GSM&hyph;102 or GSM&hyph;103
payment guarantee, including those records generated and maintained by agents, intervening purchasers, and related
companies involved in special arrangements with the exporter. The Secretary of Agriculture and the Comptroller
General of the United States, through their authorized representatives, must be given full and complete access to
the premises of the exporter or the exporter's assignee, as applicable, during regular business hours from the effective
date of the payment guarantee until the expiration of such five-year period to inspect, examine, audit, and make copies
of the exporter's, exporter's assignee's, agent's, intervening purchaser's or related company's books, records
and accounts concerning transactions relating to the payment guarantee, including, but not limited to, financial
records and accounts pertaining to sales, inventory, processing, and administrative and incidental costs, both
normal and unforeseen. During such period, the exporter or the exporter's assignee may be required to make available
to the Secretary of Agriculture or the Comptroller General of the United States, through their authorized representatives,
records that pertain to transactions conducted outside the program, if, in the opinion of the GSM, such records would
pertain directly to the review of transactions undertaken by the exporter in connection with the payment guarantee.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(2) The exporter must maintain the proof of entry required by &sect;1493.100(b), and must provide access to such documentation
if requested by the Secretary of Agriculture or his authorized representative for the five-year period specified
in paragraph (e)(1) of this section.

. It is the responsibility of all program participants to review, and fully acquaint themselves with, all regulations,
Program Announcements, and Notices to Participants relating to the GSM&hyph;102 or GSM&hyph;103 program, as applicable.
Applicants for payment guarantees under these programs are hereby on notice that they will be bound by any terms contained
in applicable Program Announcements or Notices to Participants issued prior to the date of approval of a payment guarantee.

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Submission of documents by principal officers
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
. All required submissions, including certifications, applications, reports, or requests (i.e., requests for
amendments), by exporters or exporters' assignees under this subpart must be signed by a principal or officer of the
exporter or exporter's assignee or their authorized designee(s). In cases where the designee is acting on behalf
of the principal or the officer, the signature must be accompanied by: wording indicating the delegation of authority
or, in the alternative, by a certified copy of the delegation of authority; and the name and title of the authorized
person or officer. Further, the exporter or exporter's assignee must ensure that all information/reports required
under these regulations are submitted within the required time limits. If requested in writing, CCC will acknowledge
receipt of a submission by the exporter or the exporter's assignee. If acknowledgment of receipt is requested, the
exporter or exporter's assignee must submit an extra copy of each document and a stamped self-addressed envelope
for return by U.S. mail. If courier services are desired for the return receipt, the exporter or exporter's assignee
must also submit a self-addressed courier service order which includes the recipient's billing code for such service.
